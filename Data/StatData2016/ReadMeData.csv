pane has translated relative to starting translation sincedirectionchange  and and pixels pane has translated since the direction of the pane has changed percentage   and and the percentage that the pane is open good or animating other things  the layout itself is what most people will have a hard time emulating so the simplest approach i have found is as follows two absolute elements one to represent all the content and another to represent all the drawers the content has a higher z index than the drawers within the drawers element it s direct children should represent the containers for the drawers these should be fixed or absolute assigning classes to your drawers to specify which side it is on is recommended all absolutely positioned elements should have  for top left right bottom properties excluding your panes which will have auto set to their respective sides and a width assigned the width of your drawers is usually the same number you want to use for minposition and maxposition div drawers position absolute div left drawer position absolute content div right drawer position absolute content div content position absolute top bars content overflow auto bottom bars a sample layout is found in demo and apps and default html some css is required to get some smooth ass scrolling utilize the css below to apply this to any of your elements scrollable overflow auto webkit transition property top bottom transition property top bottom webkit transition duration s s transition duration s s webkit transition timing function linear linear transition timing function linear linear webkit overflow scrolling touch because of the nature of this code drawers are just kind of stacked behind the content to bring the proper drawer to the front you can hook into snaps js css classes with addbodyclasses set to true in your initialize options one of the two classess will be added to the body tag snapjs left or snapjs right  depending on which pane is being open respectively this being said you can apply your css like the following to show the proper drawers snapjs right left drawer snapjs left right drawer display none toggles have been a popular request but rather than bog the library down with additional methods you can utilize the powerful api of snap js to create your own toggle toggles can be done like the following javascript mytogglebutton addeventlistener click  function if snapper state state left snapper close else snapper open left snap js supports cascading cancellation of events via a data attribute data snap ignore if you were to use a slider your markup might look like the following and ul all interactions on children elements of the element with the data snap ignore attribute will have their snap js events ignored simple as wack as push js is yes it is in desperate need of attention as of v    we can still solve this problem with it s only callback push javascript and and the function that will initialize your snap js instance var dosnap function if window snapper and and snap js already exists we just need to re bind events window snapper enable else and and initialize snap js window snapper new snap element document getelementbyid content  window addeventlistener push  dosnap dosnap to solve the flicker apply the following css to the element in question backface visibility hidden webkit backface visibility hidden and chrome and safari and moz backface visibility hidden and firefox and ms backface visibility hidden and internet explorer  and and this code attempts to make your webapp s feel more native these other repos go well with it too mit dawg

intake center intake center  license and acknowledgements license and acknowledgements much like visual design visual design  the process of developing a product has changed as the understanding of the medium being worked in has changed from an extension of print design to its own entity whereas in print design a final product was always the deliverable and designs for that product would be handed from one role to another without back and forth communication the web requires a new process better suited for the complex and interactive nature of the final product often referred to as waterfall  the old method of a static page being created by a designer approved by a product owner and then handed off to developers without further communication does not produce results in the best interests of anyone involved the product owner doesn t see the final product until it is all finished and ready for launch much too late to make any significant corrections or alter the path of the project instead a more agile process where product owners designers and developers all work in conjunction with one another to build value in a product throughout its development cycle is needed one where a small amount of work and constant feedback between all parties can build a large project out of small parts one where the final project may not have every bell and whistle hoped for but rather has an array of features that fulfill the maximum potential of the cost of development based on business and user needs this is a large change in the way most individuals and organizations have done this type of work in the past but by sticking to this process a better product will be built in the long run and those involved in the building will not be exhausted or burnt out by the process there are many different agile methodologies that all fulfill the same purpose of building projects in a more collaborative environment with constant communication between all roles involved in a project the scrum methodology described below is one such methodology that has found much success across many teams and organizations in any given project there are a variety of roles that each play a part in the success of a project the following is a list of the basic roles required to accomplish a project some individuals may fall into multiple categories that s okay the key is that each role has certain responsibilities and these roles need to have members throughout the entire development process ideally with each role filled by the same individuals brookss law for the duration of a project projects work best when the total number of individuals are kept to a minimum but that is not to say that it is better to have one of each rather make sure that there aren t too many individuals on a project at once either the individual who directly owns the product or company the product is being developed for or a designated representative for the product or company who has been given direct permission to make decisions for the product being developed this individual needs to be able to make decisions on their own without consulting others acts as a fully involved individual in the lifecycle of a project and must understand and be able to fully articulate the vision project vision of the project they are responsible for prioritizing the backlog backlog of determining requirements requirements for and assisting in writing user stories user stories there should only be a single product owner per project the individual in charge of ensuring the product cycle is being kept on track they take charge in managing expectations of product owners ensuring that designers and developers are able to deliver what they have committed to commitment during a sprint iterations  and working with the product owner to ensure there are enough defined consumable prioritized user stories user stories to work on for the upcoming iterations iterations project managers often run scrums scrum if there is not a dedicated person to do so there should only be a single project manager per project there are two types of designs visual design that need to happen during a typical product lifecycle user interface design the look and feel of a product and user experience design how users interact with the product user experience designers should be working with rapid prototypes rapid prototyping to flush out interaction patterns and create rough flows where user interface designers should be working with style prototypes style prototyping to determine the look and feel of components that are developed by user experience designers work both should work closely with developers user experience designers should take their cues and be part of the creation process of a product s content strategy content strategy much like designers there are two types of developers front end developers and back end developers front end developers primarily deal with what is actually put in front of users in the case of web projects the html markup  css styling  and javascript interaction  whereas backend developers primarily work on the systems needed to store retrieve and manipulate the data on the server side what users do not see both types of developers need to work together to create the final product that will be consumed by the user front end developers will spend a lot of time working with designers to ensure the final product meets their expectations while still being workable and performant performance based on the realities of the medium being developed for because of this close working relationship front end developers often straddle the line between designer and developer and should be given the leeway to do so individuals working on quality assurance qa ensure that new code created during a sprint iterations matches the requirements requirements of the user story user stories and does not break the functionality already in place from previous sprints qa needs to understand how functionality may differ across platforms on the web browsers and devices progresive enhancement and work with developers when this is unclear no code should be released tags and releases until qa has given sign off it is often useful although not necessary for an individual designer developer or qa member be designated as a lead for each discipline this can take the form of a lead designer lead developer and lead qa or it can be more specific taking the form of lead visual designer lead ux designer lead front end developer lead back end developer lead functional qa lead cross browser qa etc no matter how it is divided leads all share the same extra responsibilities leads are responsible for and have final say over direction and if appropriate architecture for their discipline communicating that direction to and mentoring the other individuals in their discipline and communicating and explaining that direction to the product owner and project manager a user story describes work that needs to be done for a feature of a particular product user stories contain benefit statements benefit statement  requirements requirements  a size and a value size and value project managers project manager and product owners product owner should work together to create the basics of a user story benefit statements benefit statement  requirements requirements  value size and value often called a stub  flush out requirements requirements with a user experience designer designer  and work with the team to ensure stories are sized size and value once all of these items are complete a user story is considered defined once a product owner has prioritized them in the backlog backlog  they are considered consumable it behooves teams to have enough user stories defined and consumable to cover the current iteration iterations and one to two iterations in the future at any given time when determining what user stories to stub out first it is important to look to the content strategy content strategy of a product content types content modeling that are most valuable should have their features prioritized when it comes to creating user stories the information architecture information architecture will also assist in determining what features are needed and therefore what user stories should be generated features based off of content strategy should have the value of their content types associated to them in order to provide insight into overall value being generated by a given feature benefit statements describe why a feature is important to be built based on user personas user personas and business needs useful in helping to determine value for a feature and can thus help in organizing the backlog backlog  benefit statements are written in the form as persona  i want desire so that rationale the functional requirements of a user story are based on the desired user experience of a feature and should be thorough enough to be completed by a designer designer or developer developer without additional question an example of incomplete requirements would be create a photo gallery on the other hand create a rotating display that holds five items paginates with swipe or mouse click draws in an image from the image content type displayed at a   ratio with the title and short description and can resize fluidly ordered by most recent item is much more thorough and can be built and designed without further input out of the first six numbers of the fibonacci sequence four are prime this limits the possibilities to break down a task equally into smaller tasks to have multiple people work on it in parallel doing so could lead to the misconception that the speed of a task could scale proportionally with the number of people working on it brookss law the  n series is most vulnerable to such a problem the fibonacci sequence in fact forces one to re estimate the smaller tasks one by one for sizes any size above  is usually too much to work on in a single iteration and the work should be split into smaller pieces and an epic or overarching story should be created size is not just based on development difficulty it includes difficulty for all team members roles and responsibilities that would work on a feature for an iteration including design and qa size should also account for risk which could increase size for features that otherwise require little actual work to do the size of a story should be agreed upon by consensus by all team members working on a feature sizing should happen throughout an iteration iterations value should be determined for each aspect that provides value generally not to exceed  per aspect a determination of how closely each benefit statement benefit statement aligns with the vision statement vision statement should always be included with additional aspects such as importance in information architecture information architecture or metrics for the feature or content type the backlog is the list of prioritized user stories that have not been worked on yet it is up to the product owner product owner to prioritize the user stories in the backlog prioritizing the backlog allows the team roles and responsibilities to know what the most important items are to work on and therefore what to size product owners should use each user story s value as a guide while they do not need to explicitly order the backlog based on the value of each user story the value provides an unbiased look at each feature in the overall scheme of the build so it should be used to guide decisions on backlog priority work should be divided up into  week iterations each iteration represents a set of user stories that designers designer  developers developer  and qa quality assurance have agreed that they can accomplish in that period of time based on how much time each individual has available often called capacity  measured not in hours but in unitless numbers similar to size and value and how difficult each user story is each two week iteration is often referred to as a sprint once a day during each sprint all team members roles and responsibilities should get together either by phone in person or both to quickly discuss progress so far these meetings are called scrum meetings during these meetings designers designer  developers developer  and qa quality assurance give a quick overview of what they have accomplished what they are going to accomplish if anything is impeding their progress often called blockers  and arrange to meet with individuals that can help to lift those blockers scrum meetings should be fast no more than  minutes and should not include the writing of stories or prolonged discussion follow up meetings are encouraged towards the end of each iteration the team should come together to determine what stories to work on for the next iteration this is called commitment when determining capacity remember to take into account meetings an individual may need to take part in including time spent sizing user stories and this and the acceptance meeting at the end of each iteration the team should come together to present the work they have accomplished to the product owner at this time the work done should be compared to the stories committed to for each story committed to if what was produced matches the requirements requirements laid out in the story the product owner product owner should accept the story as complete if the result was not what was expected by the product owner but meets all requirements as laid out in the story the product owner should still accept the story and create a new story for changes if all stories are complete and accepted the iteration passes if not the iteration fails it is okay to fail an iteration it just means estimations were off and need to be adjusted for the next iteration nine women can t make a baby in one month fred brooks  it takes some time for the people added to a project to become productive brooks calls this the ramp up time software projects are complex engineering endeavors and new workers on the project must first become educated about the work that has preceded them this education requires diverting resources already working on the project temporarily diminishing their productivity while the new workers are not yet contributing meaningfully each new worker also needs to integrate with a team composed of multiple engineers who must educate the new worker in their area of expertise in the code base day by day in addition to reducing the contribution of experienced workers because of the need to train  new workers may even have negative contributions  for example if they introduce bugs that move the project further from completion  communication overheads increase as the number of people increases the number of different communication channels increases rapidly with the number of people everyone working on the same task needs to keep in sync so as more people are added they spend more time trying to find out what everyone else is doing to combat these issues with large and expanding teams those individuals involved with a project from project managers project manager to product owners product owner to designers visual designer and developers developer  should remain as constant as possible throughout each major release tags and releases of a project they should each stay on a project for the duration of a project from the kick off of a project to a major release the team should be kept small and flexible and communication channels between all involved should be open and available throughout the duration of a project content strategy is the process by which content is analyzed sorted constructed and placed users come to a site for its content first and foremost so it is the most important part of a site before any discussion of design visual design or development website building blocks  an understanding of a product owner s product owner content is imperative in order to produce not only an effective website but lay an effective foundation for any and all future endeavors from apps to ads to printed material the entirety of a finished product is determined by this initial step from what content actually is put onto pages to what components components get built to what the final site looks like visual design before knowing what content will best serve a site and therefore what features will best serve the content a goal for the project should be decided upon this can be accomplished by writing a vision statement  and should be the first content strategy deliverable vision statements should answer the following questions who will use buy or consume the product who is the target customer who will administer and maintain the product what needs will the product address what attributes are critical to success how does the product compare with existing products what are the unique selling points vision statement provide a single grounding point for all decisions needed to create a successful product the following is an example vision statement for a made up news organization in order to provide for a well informed electorate who want to stay up to date and relate to high quality relevant worldwide news and information on an ever growing array of platforms our editorial team will utilize an easy to use platform that can be accessed from any device from across the world to quickly and effortlessly update and create news stories user personas are a tool to distill different types of people who may interact with a product into caricatures in order to work with the different types of people effectively product owner product owner  editor  and user personas should be built for each product with additional user personas or expanded base user personas as needed in order to create user personas interviews ideally in person one on one or focus groups should be conducted with different types of users in order to get a statistically relevant overview of each user type the creation of user personas can happen in parallel along with the creation of a product s vision statement vision statement  content inventory content inventory  and content audit content audit user persona research should begin with a hypothesis of what the various final user types will be and what those user types wants and needs are these hypotheses should be based on analytics of the current site if available and demographic information of target audience analytics will provide insight into what is important to users but not why similarly demographic information will provide insight into who to start with but not necessarily describe everyone who may use a product once rough sketches of starting user types are determined it is time for interviews ask users questions such as what do you find most valuable about the existing product and similar including competitors products is anything of value is missing from the existing product and the similar products how do you most often access the product what are the pain points what is the target demographic information interview not only users that meet the starting user types but users from outside those initial types as it may come to light that users outside of the initial types actually make use of the product once all user interviews have been finished it is time to create final user personas when creating user personas do not fall into the trap of assigning stereotypes to personas such as that young adults only know how to write through text message shorthand or that mobile users mobile first are rushed and distracted personas should be generated based on statistical analysis of the interviews performed take all of the information gathered from all of the interviews and based on analysis break up the results into similar groups of people what should divide users into similar groups are significant areas where multiple users use the product in similar ways not small differences or potentially even seemingly large differences like demographic user personas are about how users use a product and what they expect from it finally create a profile representing each group to be used as a final user persona each profile should contain the following information description of typical use of the product motivator for use of the product primary secondary tertiary needs pain points with the product a content inventory takes an objective broad strokes look at content that is currently available if content is not currently available create a content inventory based on perceived content needs built as a spreadsheet it can include both intrinsic title owner last updated and analytics page views rank notes data content inventories are not just about pages or screens but rather the different pieces or chunks that go into making those larger items content is not just about long blobs of text content is also images videos charts forms and any other form of information a user may want it is important to understand that not every single piece of content available must be inventoried but rather there are enough representative pieces to get a holistic view of each type of content available by inventorying all the different types of content as well as the chunks that make up the content a deep understanding of the content can be achieved that will make modeling the content content modeling easier when building content inventories it s often convenient to include limits for each widget or content chunk each item can have multiple limits each separated by a space the most prevalent limit often character count can have its type excluded other types include total number of items and dimensions the following are some useful shorthand for describing limits required  soft limit when a known limit isn t known but a known minimum is x dimensions width before height foo begins with in this case foo bar ends with in this case bar jpg and png multiple options in this case either jpg or png file extensions a content audit provides a first look at what content is available and how it is written as a way of sussing out if what is currently available is worth keeping editing or removing ask the following questions about the content and content types gathered from a content inventory content inventory is the content too long too short or just right can longer content be cut into shorter chunks and still make sense is the copy wordy does it ramble can it be cleaned up without losing its meaning does each page or chunk get to the point quickly is content even broken up into chunks is the content relevant and important after asking these questions of the content do a gap analysis of the content all content should fall into one of four categories keep as is revise and edit to tighten up copy and content types delete because it s irrelevant not useful or outdated create new where new business goals don t meet existing content new content types may be gleaned from needs discovered in user interviews user personas title of the content type description of the content type benefit statement written in the form of as persona  i want desire so that rationale similar to user stories user stories the persona comes from the compiled user personas user personas each content type can have multiple benefit statements for multiple personas value of the content type this is used to aid in creating a backlog backlog during the development process determine a value size and value for the aspects of the content a determination of how closely each benefit statement aligns with the vision statement vision statement should always be included additional aspects could include advertising revenue page rank page views and resources requires to build versus value built which if included should be counted as negative

truncate headlines always provide summaries for long copy provide alternative copy when needed build systems of content content isn t always one size fits all allow for different sizes and styles of content attributes small medium large images short and long human readable and seo friendly headlines do not build content for specific contexts device detection such as iphones androids tablets or desktops content should be easy to navigate don t paginate long pieces of content unnecessarily make it easy to navigate to sections in long pieces of content always provide enough context for a user to make their own navigation decisions a user with location services might not exclusively want location based information provide plenty of trigger words consistency and predictability keep navigation uncluttered more than  main navigation categories gets hard to scan only provide secondary navigation when absolutely necessary try to avoid having more than three levels of navigation if navigation gets cluttered stop and rework to make the architecture more comprehensible complexity and complication think about if headlines can be used as links or if alternative copy should be used content should be available don t restrict content especially based on device device detection provide alternative formats of content progressive enhancement if one format can t be made available such as through device capabilities or business needs do not store content as html but rather as raw attributes that can be presented in multiple ways this is especially true for tabular data and images related to long copy make all content available and in a way best suited for the display at hand the control which designers know in the print medium and often desire in the web medium is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page we should embrace the fact that the web doesn t have the same constraints and design for this flexibility but first we must accept the ebb and flow of things the first big change is moving away from designing pages the page metaphor is killing the web by thinking in pages instead of systems of design design gets focused on the wrong thing the big picture look and feel as opposed to the content what a user actually comes to a site for designing reusable components components and layouts layouts instead of pages allow for a more modular design providing better flexibility and a more consistent user interface ui and user experience ux the second big change is moving to in browser design design in browser  utilizing rapid prototyping rapid prototyping and style prototyping style prototyping as well as the web s building blocks website building blocks to build designs not the static graphic design tools many clients and designers are use to it s a big change but it needs to happen in order to progress past thinking of web pages as extensions of printed material and create truly web first experiences  physiological basic core needs for survival in humans this includes breathing food water and sleep  safety a sense of security in humans this include personal and financial security as well as health and well being  belonging a need to be an accepted member of a group in humans this includes family friendship and intimacy  esteem respect and evaluation of self in humans this includes confidence and respect by and of others  self actualization to become the most one can be in humans this includes morality creativity and problem solving this hierarchy can be applied to websites as well  physiological basic core needs for survival for websites this is content content strategy and navigation  safety a sense of security for websites this is information architecture information architecture and predictability consistency and predictability  belonging a need to be an accepted member of a group for websites this is performance performance and progressive enhancement progressive enhancement accepting to any and all who come to the site  esteem respect and evaluation of self for websites this is content first branding style tiles  self actualization to become the most one can be for websites this is all additional bells and whistles to make a site stand out and be individual from design flair and animations to interactions advertising and social integration as with maslow s hierarchy of needs as it relates to humans a website s base needs must be fulfilled in order for self actualization to occur if any step negatively affects a step below it that needs to be rethought self actualization cannot have a negative impact on esteem belonging safety or physiological needs and so on users really like consistency in their design consistency and predictability in design allow users to feel safe and confident as they navigate it reduces cognitive load for the user allowing them to focus on the content of a site this means that when designing instead of designing pages component based systems should be designed and pieces of those systems reused to build pages throughout the site titles button names menu items and other interaction related copy should be filled with trigger words words that inspire users to act as the outcome is obvious grids grids go a long way in ensuring that a layout is consistent having a consistent and predictable design means that when something does not follow the predefined pattern that it will stand out some ways to promote consistency and predictability include use components components of the same aspect aspects consistently and in roughly the same place use as few layouts layouts as possible especially complex layouts create new aspects sparingly don t change components based on what layout they are in avoid design decisions that are not made by designers with knowledge of the system created including user generated styling don t try and outsmart a user let them choose what they would like to do do not hide content based on screen size or device device detection users want all content give them all content complexity the richness of content and its experience complication the difficulty of using and navigating content where the challenge lies is in creating complex but comprehensible systems having a strong content strategy content strategy and interfaces that are consistent and predictable consistency and predictability are the first steps to creating complex but comprehensible systems build rich and complex interaction up from small and easy to comprehend components components instead of attempting to build large complex monoliths all at once draw upon humans natural rich tradition of story telling and conversation to assist in reducing complication in a complex system for generations humans have used conversation to pass down stories and learn about the world leverage this tradition instead of providing all information at once allow a user to explore through the content inviting conversation with them this is often referred to as progressive disclosure respond to users as they ask for more information don t throw it all at them at once focus on one item at a time and push secondary items off to the sides waiting for user interaction just as clarity will always trump density tap or click quality will always trump quantity grids do not exist in a vacuum they exist in relation to the content we never start with a grid we start with an idea which is then translated into a form a structure linda van deursen grid systems twitter bootstrap zurb foundation flow content in a generic way that may be usable but are not recommended as they neither an extension of a site s content nor its design grids are primarily used in layouts layouts in css the following grid examples are based on the singularity grid framework there are three parts that make up a grid they are the columns the gutters and the gutter style columns an individual section of a grid columns that are based on relationships between each other work best for content out responsive grids and being able to create these types of columns are one of the hallmarks of a grid framework columns that are all equally sized are generic and what are usually found in grid systems grids grids are a collection of columns when attaching items to a grid they are either attached to a whole column or multiple columns if attached to multiple columns the total span includes all of the gutters spanned gutters gutters are the whitespace between each column content is never snapped to a gutter and each gutter is the same width gutters can fluid in relation to column width or fixed either a fixed value or a fixed percentage gutter styles gutters can either be placed opposite each column with the last column not receiving a gutter and c and g and c and g and c and or split in half with each column getting one half of a gutter s width on either side including the first and last columns and g and c and g and c and g and c and g the most common type of grid is a symmetric grid and usually what is defined by grid systems a symmetric grid is defined as a grid where each column is the same size the most common type of symmetric grid is the  column symmetric grid symmetric grids have a tendency to constrain creativity in negative ways mostly due to the fact that design then starts with the grid instead of with the content there is also an interesting mix of freedom and constraint in symmetric grids that when used to lay out content on anything other than a column by column basis  columns  identically sized pieces of content  provides enough flexibility to allow designs to meander custom asymmetric grids are asymmetric grids where column sizes are determined by the designer any set of columns of differing sizes can be used to create an asymmetric grid this example shows a split gutter grid with columns in relation of    compound grids are asymmetric grids that are created by overlaying two or more symmetric grids on top of each other to create a new asymmetric grid the example shows a   compound grid where a  column symmetric and a  column symmetric grid are overlaid to create a  column asymmetric grid why not simply use a  column grid with this compound grid spans are constrained to multiples of  and  and  and  meaning that a span of  and  or  and  could not happen the top section shows the final compound grid with the middle section showing the grid split into thirds and bottom section showing the grid split into quarters ratio based grids are grids where each column is based on a ratio of the previous column this allows for interesting constraints such as allowing the ratios for vertical rhythm font size line height to also be used for horizontal rhythm the grid anti patterns are patterns many times common patterns that even if popular should be avoided as they go against either best user intentions best technological intentions best business intentions or a combination of all three there are three big places where anti patterns tend to pop up these are dark patterns dark patterns signal to noise ratio signal to noise ratio outdated ux patterns outdated ux patterns just like how presentations deprecate so do ux patterns there are a plethora of outdated ux patterns currently being used that do not suit users or business well and their usage should be ceased the following list is by no means comprehensive but should be used as a guide along with in person testing and analytics to determine if patterns being used should be updated large background images large background images add a large amount of weight to a page for very little actual gain any user whose screen is generally smaller than px will absolutely not see the background image small screens simply don t have the screen real estate to display content and background images hover states for additional information hiding additional information exclusively in hover states precludes that information from being accessible to users without fine pointers mega menus mega menus became popular for providing infinitely nested menus or in the worst cases micro sites for each menu these create complexity issues for uses are particularly hard to navigate without fine pointers large sticky headers and footers sticky headers or footers headers or footers that do not scroll with the page but rather stay put in their position aren t necessarily bad in and of themselves it s when they are large and take up a lot of screen real estate regardless of the size of the screen having both sticky headers and sticky footers significantly reduces screen real estate and should likewise be avoided text over images placing text over images should be avoided for variable length text as the combination of the two has a tendency to produce unexpected results and has a high likelihood of obscuring important parts of the image or overrunning and potentially covering the entire image if not well controlled this later is especially likely to happen if a user changes their default text size when images are small covering the entirety of an image becomes very likely accordions and tabs while fine if used for their designated purpose accordions and tab panes used to contain sub pages hide navigation and content which is bad for user experience and are generally hard to make work in a responsive manner overlays overlays are a ux pattern popular for everything from insertional to modal content or interaction overlays while seemingly a boon for user experience wind up creating countless issues for users without keyboards fine pointers who resize their browser or generally would like to exit one without going forward through the user interface back buttons popularized by ios back buttons have become popular especially with designed that try to mimic app like interfaces don t use them every browser has a native easily accessible well integrated back button one that behaves better than any that could or should be built page preloaders users want to get to a site s content as quickly as possible if instead of providing it a preloader is put up that is designed to halt a user from getting content until every piece that makes up that content is available a user is likely to leave and not come back performance social integration while social integration is often seen as a great boon more often than not the plethora of third party logos scattered throughout a page make a site look more like nascar than a finely crafted brand while the effect of this hasn t been thoroughly researched yet there is one truth social integration provides free advertising for those social networks and ties the site s branding to those social networks for better or worse content pagination users are very comfortable scrolling vertically on a page and have a tendency to get frustrated when content is paginated unnecessarily only paginate content if it is absolutely necessary and even then provide users a way of viewing the full contents on a single page content insertionals seen often in article views content insertionals are usually links to other tangentially related content in between paragraphs as a stand alone paragraph or as non hyperlink links in an article that produce a hover or click modal of other likewise tangentially related content these items take the user s attention and prevent them from being immersed in the content auto play media auto playing media audio or video is something a user never likes to see the choice to play media should be triggered explicitly by the user non user triggered actions when actions take place that are disruptive to the user that the user did not trigger it takes them out of being immersed in the content examples of non disruptive non user triggered actions that are ok are infinite pagination or bringing in a next article flag at the bottom of an article examples of disruptive non user triggered actions include loading content above where the user is pushing the page down and refreshing a gallery of images as a user is browsing them infinite pagination infinite pagination that truly is infinite should be reconsidered for a more measured approach where two to four pages are automatically loaded with additional loads being triggered by user interaction missing navigational trails while it may look nice or be trendy to have url schemas or breadcrumbs that provide a general sense of where a user is users much prefer to explicitly know where they are on a site a url constructed to be site com and show name provides no context to the user as to where they are on a site guess what the web s not a laser printer karen mcgrane to combat these inaccuracies instead of designing websites in static graphic design tools design should take place with the tools of the web html markup  css styling  and javascript interaction this goes for both ui and ux design ux should be sussed out utilizing rapid prototyping rapid prototyping and ui utilizing style prototyping style prototyping by doing so what gets signed off on by the client is work that inherently conforms to the realities of the web as opposed to a picture that may or may not in addition by designing in browser how design choices affect performance performance can be readily seen allowing for performance to be part of the design process not an afterthought designing in browser also allows for creative opportunities that would otherwise be missed by designing in static drawing environments from hover states to animation text shadowing and drawing with css there are many places where actually working in the medium of the web affords greater creative control and creative expression than simply working in static single state environments when building responsive sites responsive web design  designs should be built mobile first mobile first which simply cannot be done in static environments because design decisions will need to be made throughout the lifespan of a project the designers both ui and ux responsible for the design of a site need to be part of the full lifecycle of a project and cannot simply hand off initial designs and walk away from a project when development starts when designing in browser the process of design changes from a purely visual one to a combined team effort the following roles are involved in the visual design process like in the general roles and responsibilities roles and responsibilities  these roles may be filled by the same person and should be the same set of individuals throughout the duration of a project this process is for designing and implementing a project simultaneously the product owners product owner and project managers project manager help to prioritize what gets designed and what the requirements of the design should be the designers designer do the visual and user experience design during the transition phase before all of a team s designers can code and work in browser designers are divided into visual designers and production designers visual designers are designers who cannot code and work directly in browser and production designers are those who can the developers developer do the production development work there are two types of developers involved in this back end developers and front end developers back end developers generally work with server side languages and front end developers on the client side languages although this depends on the actual implementation the qa members quality assurance test the work developed to ensure it works as expected  story the product owners project managers visual and production designers front and back end developers and qa members agree upon the requirements for a given item in agile scrum this is a user story user stories each story should be for a single component components  a single layout layouts  or placing components and layouts together the story should be based on the project s information architecture information architecture and should include information about where content is coming from based on the project s content models content modeling  html the visual and production designers and front and back end developers agree upon the markup markup to use for the story they are working on including the classes css naming conventions that will be used the markup used needs to work for both the in browser design style prototyping and the implementation rapid prototyping rapid prototyping can be employed to suss out the markup  design the visual and production designers work on creating the look feel and interaction interaction for the story this can be done at the same time as development  development the front and back end developers work together in the actual implementation of the project to output the agreed upon markup this can be done at the same time as design  feature qa the front and back end developers and qa team ensure that the implementation has the correct markup and the content is being drawn from the correct places they also make sure story related code functions properly this happens after a story s development is complete and is part of that story s design cycle  integration the visual and production designers and the front and back end developers work together to integrate the in browser design with the implementation resolving any issues that may arise  regression qa the visual and production designers front and back end developers and qa team ensure that the in browser design have been fully integrated into the implementation and that no previous work has broken by doing so it s not about mobile first or just small screen first it s about content first but it happens that thinking about what works for mobile does work for other things as well so when a team designs mobile first the end result is an experience focused on the key tasks users want to accomplish without the extraneous detours and general interface debris that litter today s desktop accessed web sites that s good user experience and good for business using mobile as a focusing lens will also help to inform a site s information architecture information architecture and help to create complex but not complicated complexity and complication interfaces it is important to keep in mind that larger screens do not mean that the learnings gained by the mobile lens can be tossed away simply because there is more screen real estate the goal is to improve the ux for all sizes of a site not just the small version do not give in to the desire to fill up whitespace on larger screens with additional unneeded items simply because there is more room that should be filled during this process it is also helpful for front end developers to create reusable patterns in css especially around creating functions and mixins in sass sass and compass and explain to and work with the designer to enhance these patterns allowing the designer to get comfortable writing pattern based code this also lays the foundation for rapid iteration of a design idea eventually the designer should be allowed to take over full responsibility of coding and designing with the front end developer moving on to focus their efforts on semantics html semantics  accessibility accessibility  and javascript interaction while designing in browser is the standard to achieve for many times a designer will want to work out design ideas outside of browser this may include a static graphic design tool pencil and paper tablet sketching app or anything else a designer may find handy this is encouraged however what is produced through these design sessions should be considered sketches and should not be a deliverable to be signed off on by the client a picture is not a requirement statement they are not useful to those building the final site as they are not an accurate representation of what will be built to the product owner product owner s and fail to capture the nuance actually required to produce what is being sketched pictures are nothing more than a good idea they are not requirements until they are prototyped rapid prototyping  and prototypes are not production ready until they are built to be so component guide pictures and sketches are great ways to come up with ideas but final sign off can only happen in browser style tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web a style guide is the core set of styling for each element on a page it is the combined base browser styling reset base browser styling and the base component base component styling so it may be referred to as either the base guide or element guide as well items styled in the style guide should be contained under the base styled class as basic styling should not bleed outside of that class each element in a style guide should include the markup required to create it as well as the styling applied to allow for easy reference and self documentation a component guide is a listing of each component components for a project grouped by component with a rendered display of each aspect utilizing each of the component s elements accompanying each aspect display should be the markup and styling used each component group should include a listing of available elements the available extendable classes mixins and variables if a component has javascript associated with it the javascript filename should be included along with the source code a layout guide is a listing of each layout layouts for a project grouped by layout with a rendered display of each aspect utilizing each of the layout s elements accompanying each aspect display should be the markup and styling used each layout group should include a listing of available elements the available extendable classes mixins and variables if a component has javascript associated with it the javascript filename should be included along with the source code layout guides should not include components in their display but should rather use placeholder components generally a grey box responsive is not a line item it s design jason pamental when starting projects rwd should not be a line item something to throw on at the end or not included responsive web design should be the standard for all projects from the beginning  acknowledge and embrace unpredictability we can t be all things to all devices create meaningful content and services design content models to be used across presentations website apps apis etc design content models around standards to be interoperable focus on its long term integrity having well structured content is essential to art direction structure and store content accordingly  help others do the same the set of suggestions from the future friendly manifesto that should not be followed as written are those dealing with device categorization and device detection device detection the sentiment is correct enhance any given device with a user experience that is tailored to its capabilities but that should be done using progressive enhancement progressive enhancement and feature detection feature detection instead creating enhanced experiences this way and encouraging users to take advantage of those enhanced experiences as opposed to forcing them upon users based on their user agent string allows for a more sustainable and future looking approach to delivering these experiences device detection extends to choices made when designing sites as well not just user agent strings common examples of non user agent string device detection include mimicking ios native app visual styling and user experience patterns on the web constraining designs to phone  tablet  and desktop sizes or small  medium  and large  choosing media queries and breakpoints based on common device sizes and making assumptions about features based on screen size such as small screens have touch capabilities any time you say somebody won t want that on their phone you re wrong if it s not good for the mobile user it s not good for any user we re the same people while talking about mobile the point is as follows users are the same regardless of the device they choose to use assuming a user has a different set of wants or needs exclusively based on the fact a user agent string says they are using a tablet device will always be wrong bring personal experience into decision making when browsing a website on your phone are your wants and needs there all that different than when you do so on a desktop computer mobile users want to see our menu hours and delivery number desktop users definitely want this mb png of someone smiling at a salad mat marquis take away what we can t know screen size device capabilities concurrent activities depth of focus purpose of visit take away the make believe take away what we can t know they re fantasies jason pamental when building sites they should always be built content first once the content is built each enhancement that is added from styling to interaction should be added with this in mind a good experience needs to be available to all users do not design pages for the most cutting edge browsers design for the content where feature detection based progressive enhancement differs from standard progressive enhancement is that where standard progressive enhancement is concerned with the whole site and the overall user experience feature detection based progressive enhancement is generally based around a single user experience enhancement such as a flexbox powered layout or a location based enhancement to search advertising on responsive sites is hard most ads are still sold fixed size and fixed position with even more still being sold for only desktop or only mobile when building responsive sites these notions need to fall away as there is no longer a distinction between desktop and mobile a design is a single fluid continuum device specific ads do not do device detection device detection to place ads sold for mobile or desktop instead even though it goes against the device detection best practice determine a screen size that constitutes the switch between mobile and desktop  then swap ads based on that size instead work with ad sales to stop selling ads targeted to devices and instead sell general advertising asynchronous ads a performance performance best practice do not load ads in line load them asynchronously background ads ads that are placed outside of the content area of a page such as background ads or rail ads encounter all of the same issues as large background images outdated ux patterns do and should be avoided for the same reason unlike when designing for print there is an ever growing array of resolutions both pixel density and available viewable area that a single design may show up on and designs must be made to accommodate these varying resolutions this huge swatch of resolutions that need to be taken into account can be extremely daunting to work with if a design is not done in browser design in browser adapting designs for the available viewable area should be handled by media queries whereas pixel density gets handled differently depending upon the item that needs to be resolution independent when choosing media queries avoid falling into the indirect device detection device detection trap of picking values based on devices this includes both direct correlations like widths of an iphone and ipad and indirect correlations like a generalized width of a mobile and a tablet device sites should not be built to devices and should likewise not have  or  values often called breakpoints that are used for everything instead build components components that react to their own needs and layouts layouts that change and adapt based on content it is not uncommon to have  and breakpoints in any given project do not group like media queries together media queries should be written with the component or layout they are working for to ease maintainability and readability grouping media queries together makes it very hard to tweak individual media queries as needed and update styling to only specific items make each use of a media query meaningful and connected to the component or layout it is dealing with iconography is usually an integral part of complex designs and therefore it is imperative that icons be resolution independent currently the two best practices for resolution independent icons are as follows design depends largely on constraints charles eames www scielo cl and pdf and arq and n and art pdf there are a number of design constraints when creating projects that are responsive designing for the web and designing for print have a different set of initial constraints and a different set of ongoing constraints so when designing for the web visual design the constraints and process of print design likely won t work design in browser the following is an explanation of some of the new design constraints of designing for the web  t here is no mobile web there are plenty of mobile devices and equally there is no desktop web it is just the web one web when designing for the web no matter the screen size or device device detection a user chooses to access a site with that is not a different web it s not the mobile web on an iphone or the tablet web on a nexus or a desktop web the user is always the same always wants to do the same thing as such when designing for the web there design is limited to a single codebase that gets served to the end user no mobile templates for mobile users and desktop templates for desktop users one single codebase the html source order that makes up a site is pretty sacred it is the grounding for a solidly accessible accessibility site and for search engine optimization rdfa as it is the single source of truth for a website it cannot change across different devices device detection users come to a site for its content first and foremost content strategy in fact it is the most basic need website needs of a user hiding content based on screen size or device device detection precludes users from getting the content they came to the site for any time you say somebody won t want that on their phone you re wrong both information architecture information architecture and visual design visual design must start mobile first mobile first and not make assumptions about content or user capabilities progressive enhancement based on screen size or device all content needs to be available regardless of device a user chooses to access a site with this is not to say that systems of content cannot be employed if only a small amount of space is available pulling in a short headline instead of a long headline is fine as is bringing in smaller or larger content images the caution here is to not tie these content choices to devices device detection but rather the layout and the needs of the content itself it s not just what it looks like and feels like design is how it works performance is a design constraint performance from the download size payload performance to how the page works page performance unlike print design where there are few if any performance constraints of the final product and anything that can be imagined can be placed onto the page everything from the fonts and icons to the layout and ornamentation have the potential to negatively affect performance on the web the performance constraints placed on a site are not only for the design of the site but for its content a well moving out of print design tools and into the web design in browser will allow for instant feedback to how design decisions influence performance of a site that amounts to a daily loss of   or about   million a year by keeping your client side code small and lightweight you can literally open your product up to new markets in addition to the below sites should be able to hit and maintain certain performance benchmarks from a variety of different resources across the internet these systems are a good way of doing easy tests of a site to determine how they stack up the following are good testing and grading resources and the minimum target scores for each resource first byte time  use persistent connection  use gzip compression for transferring compressible responses  compress images  use progressive jpegs  leverage browser caching of static assets  use a cdn for all static assets  load times load sizes and number of requests are extraordinarily important and often overlooked or left to the end of a development cycle to start to optimize ideal statistics are presented first with maximums presented second that should only be broached under edge circumstances it is always best to keep actual performance as much under these numbers as possible time to first byte ms ms dom content loaded ms ms js load event fired ms ms total download size mb mb dns lookup ms ms http requests   once a site has been downloaded performance of the user interactions is important as well the goal to reach for is a site running at or above  frames per second anything below this makes sites appear poorly built sluggish and unresponsive when dealing with user input interactions should be under ms to feel instant and under ms to feel fast anything longer and interactions begin to feel sluggish some good rules of thumb to avoid the user interface from feeling this way are do not bind expensive processes to document and window events scroll resize etc do not emulate fixed positioning using javascript animate through css instead of javascript avoid internet explorer s css expression selectors there are a number of optimization techniques that can be employed in order to enhance overall performance on a site some of these are battle hardened optimizations that should be employed on all sites while others are more experimental as such they will be divided into categories based on which are most critical for success and which can be played with avoid page redirects provide proper headers for all files static files fonts js css should have sufficiently long cache at least  days images should have a slightly shorter cache at least  days html should have a short cache around  minutes internet explorer edge header should always be passed all javascript should be moved to the footer document write should be avoided images with no transparency should be served as progressive jpegs not as png files css and javascript should be minified and aggregated do not group css by media in link tags all of the css gets downloaded anyway instead reduce the number of aggregates and wrap internal css in media queries use a cdn cache page requests ensure that files that are only useful on particular pages only load on those pages not all pages always load css before javascript employ a responsive image solution until a standard exists look for one based on image width over viewport size async all ads when utilizing a cdn such as akamai use it to serve scripts such as jquery instead of google s cdn as it will be faster on a cold cache inline small but important files generally kb to reduce http requests aggregate other small files to reduce http requests inline above the fold css into the html push additional css to the footer dynamically serve appropriately sized images from server side instead of relying upon a client side technique use north s styling guidelines styling for specific class naming conventions this includes north s conventions on component and layout naming as well as using data attributes instead of js classes if there is a conflict between the coding guide s standards and north s standards defer to north s standards generally there should not be multiple css files unless it will absolutely benefit performance performance use north s partial structure partial structure standards instead mixins that affect multiple properties such as grid mixins  should come before any individual properties to ensure declared styles are not overridden extends should be declared first before any other properties are declared including mixins the core of every website is the underlying markup that through styling styling and interaction interaction  gets transformed into a web experience this underlying code is the heart and soul of every site and should be treated as such by properly utilizing html semantic markup and ensuring content is accessible and properly marked up with resource description framework in attributes rdfa  websites will be able to achieve better search engine optimization seo and ensure that the content will be highly available no matter the accessing system and last long in to the future meta name viewport content width device width initial scale   if markup is the skeleton of a website styling is the funny hat through css a stack of content on a page can become flexible and fantastically flourished with the introduction of css styling can now include such fanciful additions such as animations perspective and even d but with all of this power and all of this responsibility a firm structure to create a system of style needs to be in place or else everything can run off of the tracks below represents a component based systematic approach to styling each project should contain a base component which contains base styling for raw tags h  blockquote  p  etc the base component s elements should be named after the tag they style so basic styling for h would provide both an extendable and full class base h to apply these styles create a styled aspect providing a base styled class this aspect should have raw elements styled without classes allowing it to be dropped into any section of a site and provide basic styling additional aspects can be created to create different base stylings such as form for base form styling layouts are the structure of an interface providing structure to pages and components layouts are responsible for sizing and positioning of their elements layouts are generally used for laying out pages and regions within pages layouts that include viewport based media queries width  height  etc should never be nested inside each other aspects are a specific implementation of a component or layout aspects can be used as a way to pivot styling of elements if need be or to control implementation specific styling such as changing colors in a message component or determining exact sizing of a body element of a layout it is preferable to use aspects as pivot points rather than to create unique classes for each element as it allows for the reuse of identical elements regardless of the aspect of a component or layout they are used in elements should only pivot off of aspects not off of an aspect less component or layout elements are the individual pieces that make up a component or layout each being component or layout specific think of them as individual html elements h  blockquote  p  etc in components and regions and items in layouts when styling an item inside components or layouts it is strongly discouraged to use raw tag selectors and instead use element classes for each this is to avoid any potential conflicts such as would happen if there would be a pager component inside of a slider component slider li and pager li the only exception to this rule is for the base component base component states provide a way to alter how a component layout element or aspect behaves common states include active  open  and closed because states live in the in between world of javascript and css often changing with interactions from the user states are controlled by data attributes data state active and get attached to the components layouts elements or aspects they are modifying this provides easy to maintain states on a per object basis without needing per object states components and layouts form prefixes for aspects and elements separated by double dash layouts start with an underscore  to distinguish them from components aspects are written in all caps caps to distinguish them from elements written in all lowercase lowercase states are applied to the state data attribute data state and queried using attribute selectors as they have the strong tendency to either be manipulated by javascript or be used as a hook for javascript if an object has multiple states each state should be space separated in the data state data attribute a sample document written up using this naming convention could look like the following h class typography primary heading article title and h and div figure class article media and div and figure h some user entered copy goes here and h and div and article h class typography tertiary heading block title and h and div and div and div httppath and cssdir css sassdir sass imagesdir images javascriptsdir js fontsdir fonts relativeassets true linecomments false mixins are best used when they don t needlessly duplicate the properties they write we can do this using placeholder selectors and extend the only properties that should be directly written to the selector calling a mixin should be properties that have been directly altered due to mixin arguments any other properties should be extended all arguments that have default values should have those default values controlled by globally namespaced default variables to make overriding those defaults easy and accessible all mixins that provide extends should also have an extend optional argument ideally as its last argument also globally defaulted mixins should also be divided up by purpose while an omni mixin may be easier to write having smaller mixins will make maintaining and using said mixins as well as changing discrete parts of a rendered component easier to do let s take a look at a typical message component mixin as an example of how to re write it using our mixin and extend pattern mixin message color padding em em width  box sizing border box padding padding width width margin  auto border px solid color background mix white color  color mix black color  message status include message green message warning include message yellow message error include message red and css and message status box sizing border box padding em em width  margin  auto border px solid green background fff color  message warning box sizing border box padding em em width  margin  auto border px solid yellow background fffff color bfbf message error box sizing border box padding em em width  margin  auto border px solid red background ffff color bf while the single mixin may allow us to easily get the output we want it does so at the cost of duplicating properties and thus vastly bloating our output css this can be remedied almost entirely simply by rewriting our original mixin using our new mixin and extend pattern message padding em em default message width  default message extend true default mixin message padding message padding width message width extend message extend padding padding width width include message static extend mixin message static extend message extend if extend true include dynamic extend message include message static false else include box sizing border box margin  auto border px solid mixin message coloring color border color color background mix white color  color mix black color  message core and and we include the message core mixin with extend false to force the properties to be written include message message status extend message core include message coloring green message warning extend message core include message coloring yellow message error extend message core include message coloring red and css and message status message warning message error padding  em  em width  message status message warning message error box sizing border box margin  auto border px solid message status border color green background fff color  message warning border color yellow background fffff color bfbf message error border color red background ffff color bf while this approach certainly requires more work up front to build the mixins and extendables it produces much more controlled and succinct output css which is what we re aiming to write at the root of our sass folder is our style scss file which holds the core of our styling and a partials directory to hold our various partials the partials directory should be divided up into  sub directories global  base  components  and layouts inside of global  there should be a folder a piece for variables  functions  mixins  and extendables  with partials to match inside each of those folders should go partials whose content should be made available globally and aren t component specific for instance global color and typographic variables background and text color contrast mixins ligature extendables etc base components and layouts should be built using the same partial structure henceforth known as the component partial structure each component should have a partial and matching folder and inside that folder a partial a piece for variables  functions  mixins  and extends each of these partials should hold styling knowledge specific to that component for instance variables could have color variables specific to that component but the color it is set to should come from the global color partial an example of this can be seen in the example sass folder the import once extension should be utilized to prevent duplication of selectors for extendable classes mixins should share their naming convention with the object they are used to style global private variables ones that users should not touch but are needed to hold information for functions or mixins should start with a capital letter as sass variables are case sensitive what is better than a funny hat a funny hat that spins javascript adds interactivity to web pages transforming them from static documents into living ones javascript is a very flexible and powerful tool but as stan lee says with great power there must also come great responsibility functions must be declared before they are used all custom scripts should be wrapped in anonymous self executing functions with any external dependencies passed in javascript function var intro once upon a time  princess princess  button button function fairytale name princess html intro and name and  button click function fairytale princess text jquery when building site very often a point will come when a decision must be made as to if a certain javascript library plugin or framework should be used in addition to evaluating rd party scripts based on the quality of their code and their adherence to the javascript style guide the following questions should be considered is the added functionality worth the weight a lot can be accomplished with very little in javascript if a minified version of a script is larger than kb seriously consider if everything that it offers is needed or if something smaller and lighter weight can be just as effective is a  kb slider library plus the weight of jquery really worth the precious few bytes and http requests needed for a fast and performant site if the script builds off of another framework such as a jquery plugin examine the problem and determine if writing a custom solution can be as effective and lighter not everything needs to be a jquery plugin if a script does not come with a minified version determine if it can be minified all scripts should be minified so if a script being evaluated cannot that should be taken into consideration is the script performant does it have performance benchmarks if not can it be benchmarked if a script regardless of weight slows down a site significantly its use should be reconsidered there have been a handful of tools that have been created in order to assist in working with the north standards making building awesome things easier component name include component name content include components names content layout name include layout name content include layoutss names content aspect name include aspect name content include aspects names content element name include element name content include elements names content state name include state name content include states names content each function save state will return their given part of a selector aspect will only return the capitalized half of a selector layout will only return the lowercased name with leading underscore etc state will return a full attribute selector to be used mixins must contain content the plural versions of each mixin allow multiple names to be passed each getting comma separated in the output usage of the mixins can look something like the following message include aspect warning background yellow include aspect error background red include element title font size em message warning background yellow message error background red message title font size em one of the primary goals of north was to create a set of development standards that not only were designed for a modern workflow and process in mind but also that came from the learnings and understandings of multiple industry leading experts not a single person these standards reach across multiple verticals so having experts from each vertical is critical to the success of these standards the following individuals assisted in brainstorming and developing north or otherwise directly influenced north and have not otherwise been acknowledged in the document itself and for that i am grateful

1630999, this is a little server client library to allow concurrent editing of any kind of content via ot the server runs on nodejs and the client works in nodejs or a web browser sharejs currently supports operational transform on plain text and arbitrary json data browser support  sharejs should work with all browsers down to ie  although ie support hasn t been tested with the new version that said i only test regularly with ff safari and chrome and occasionally with ie and file bug reports if you have issues installing and running  npm install share run the example server with coffee nodemodules and share and examples and server coffee not all of the sharejs   examples have been ported across yet i d love some pull requests backend data model read the livedb readme for information on how to configure your database run the tests npm install mocha to get started with the server api you need to do  things decide where your data is going to be stored you can mess around using the livedb inmemory store for more options see the livedb decide how your client and server will communicate the easiest solution is to create a sharejs server instance javascript var livedb require livedb var sharejs require share var backend livedb client livedb memory var share require share server createclient backend backend the method is called createclient because its sort of a client of the database its a weird name just roll with it the sharejs server instance has  methods you might care about to communicate with a client create a node stream which can communicate with a client and use share listen stream to hand control of the stream to sharejs see the section below on client server communication for an example of share rest returns a connect and express router which exposes the sharejs rest api this code is in the process of moving to its own repo in the meantime the documentation is you can intercept requests to the livedb backend to do access control using sharejs middleware share use method function action callback will make your function intercept potentially rewrite requests this is not currently documented but when it is the documentation will live sharejs requires you to provide a way for the client to communicate with the server as such its transport agnostic you can use requires the transport to guarantee in order message delivery danger danger socket io does not guarantee this provide a websocket like api on the client provide a node object stream to the server to talk to a client when a client times out the server will throw away all information related to that client when the client client reconnects it will reestablish all its state on the server again it is the responsibility of the transport to handle reconnection the client should emit state change events to tell sharejs that it has reconnected the server exposes a method share listen stream which you can call with a node stream which can communicate with the client here s an example using browserchannel javascript var duplex require stream duplex var browserchannel require browserchannel server var share require share server createclient backend var app require express app use browserchannel webserver webserver  function client var stream new duplex objectmode true stream read function stream write function chunk encoding callback if client state closed client send chunk callback client on message  function data stream push data client on close  function reason stream push null stream emit close stream on end  function client close and and give the stream to sharejs return share listen stream and here examples and ws coffee is a more complete example using websockets the client needs a object to communicate you can use a normal websocket if you want javascript var ws new websocket ws and and and window location host var share new sharejs connection ws sharejs also supports the following changes from the spec the socket can reconnect simply call socket onopen again when the socket reconnects and sharejs will reestablish its session state and send any outstanding user data if your underlying api allows data to be sent while in the connecting state set socket cansendwhileconnecting true if your api allows json messages set socket cansendjson true to avoid extra json stringifying if you use browserchannel all of this is done for you simply tell browserchannel to reconnect and it ll take care of everything javascript var socket new bcsocket null reconnect true var share new sharejs connection socket the client api can be used either from nodejs or from a browser from the server javascript var connection require share client connection socket from the browser you ll need to first include the sharejs library you can use browserify and require share client or include the script directly the browser library is built to the nodemodules and share and webclient directory when you install sharejs this path is exposed programatically at require share scriptsdir you can add this to your express app javascript var sharejs require share app use express static sharejs scriptsdir then in your web app include whichever ot types you need in your app and sharejs this will create a global sharejs object in the browser the client exposes  classes you care about the connection class wraps a socket and handles the communication to the sharejs server you use the connection instance to create document references in the client all actual data you edit will be wrapped by the doc class the document class stores an in memory copy of the document data with your local edits applied create a document instance by calling connection get collection  docname sharejs also allows you to make queries to your database live bound queries will return a query object these are not currently documented to get started you first need to create a connection javascript var sjs new sharejs connection socket the socket must be a websocket like object see the section on client server communication for details about how to create a socket the most important method of the connection object is get connection get collection docname get a document reference to the named document on the server this function returns the same document reference each time you call connection get collection and docname are both strings connections also expose methods for executing queries createfetchquery index query options callback executes a query against the backend and returns a set of documents matching the query via the callback createsubscribequery index query options callback run a query against the backend and keep the result set live returns a query object via the callback for debugging connections have  additional properties set connection debug true to console log out all messages sent and recieved over the wire connection messagebuffer contains the last  messages for debugging error states document objects store your actual data in the client they can be modified syncronously and they can automatically sync their data with the server document objects can be modified offline they will send data to the server when the client reconnects normally you will create a document object by calling connection get collection docname destroy the document reference using doc destroy documents start in a dumb inert state you have three options to get started normally you want to call doc subscribe callback this will fetch the current data from the server and subscribe the document object to a feed of changes from other clients if you don t want to be subscribed anymore call doc unsubscribe callback if you don t want a live feed of changes call doc fetch callback to get the data from the server your local document will be updated automatically every time you submit an operation if you know the document doesn t exist on the server for example the doc name is a new guid  you can immediately call doc create type data callback there s a secret th option if you re doing server side rendering you can initialize the document object with bundled data by calling doc ingestdata type  data to call a method when a document has the current server data pair your call to subscribe with doc whenready function your function will be called immediately if the document already has data both subscribe and fetch take a callback which will be called when the operation is complete in sharejs   this callback is being removed most of the time you should call whenready instead the semantics are a little different in each case the subscribe and fetch callbacks are called when the operation has completed successfully or unsuccessfully its possible for a subscription to fail but succeed when the client reconnects on the other hand whenready is called once there s data it will not be called if there was an error subscribing once you have data you should call doc getsnapshot to get it note that this returns the doc s internal doc object you should never modify the snapshot directly instead call doc submitop documents follow the sharejs and livedb object implicitly exist on the server but they have no data and no type until you create them so you can subscribe to a document before it has been created on the server and a document on the server can be deleted and recreated without you needing a new document reference to make changes to a document you can call one of these three methods doc create type data  context  callback create the document on the server with the given type and initial data type will usually be text or json data specifies initial data for the document for text documents this should be an initial string for json documents this should be json stringify able data if unspecified initial data is an empty string or null for text and json respectively doc submitop op context  callback submit an operation to the document the operation must be valid for the given ot type of the document see the text document ot document ot context instead of calling submitop directly described below doc del context  callback delete the document on the server the document reference will become null in all cases the context argument is a user data object which is passed to all event emitters related to this operation this is designed so data bindings can easily ignore their own events the callback for all editing operations is optional and informational it will be called when the operation has been acknowledged by the server to be notified when edits happen remotely register for the op event see events section below if you want to pause sending operations to the server call doc pause this is useful if a user wants to edit a document without other people seeing their changes call doc resume to unpause send any pending changes to the server the other option to edit documents is to use a document editing context document contexts are thin wrappers around submitop which provide two benefits  an editing context does not get notified about its own operations but it does get notified about the operations performed by other contexts editing the same document this solves the problem that multiple parts of your app may bind to the same document  editing contexts mix in api methods for the ot type of the document this makes it easier to edit the document note that the json api is currently a bit broken so this is currently only useful for text documents create a context using context doc createcontext contexts have the following methods properties context submitop op callback wrapper for doc submitop op context callback context onop function op this is a hook for you and the type api to add your own logic when operations happen if you re using the text api bind to context oninsert and context onremove instead context destroy destroy the context the context will stop getting messages if you re making a text edit binding bind to a document context instead of binding to the document itself in the nodejs tradition documents are event emitters they emit the following events ready emitted when the document has data from the server consider using whenready callback instead of this event so your function is called immediately if the document already has data from the server subscribe emitted when the document is subscribed this will be re emitted when the document is resubscribed each time the client reconnects unsubscribe emitted when the document is unsubscribed this will be re emitted whenever the document is unsubscribed due to the client being disconnected nothing pending emitted after sending data to the server when there are no outstanding operations to send pair with haspending to find out when there is outstanding data this is useful for displaying are you sure you want to close your browser window messages to the user create emitted when the document has been created called with context del emitted when the document has been deleted the del event is triggered with context oldsnapshot before op emitted right before an operation is applied called with op context op emitted right after each part of an operation is applied called with op context this is usually called just once but you can specify doc incremental true to tell the document to break the operation into smaller parts and emit them one at a time after op emitted after an operation all of it is applied called with op context operations lock the document for probably bad reasons it is illegal to call submitop in the event handlers for create  del  before op or op events if you want to make changes in response to an operation register for the after op or unlock events here s some code to get started editing a text

boolean for the requested state useful when you need to know if the editor is loaded yet for example below is a list of supported states loaded unloaded preview fullscreen javascript fullscreenbtn onclick function if editor is loaded return editor enterfullscreen opens a client side storage file into the editor note this does not open files on your server or machine yet this simply looks in localstorage where epiceditor stores drafts javascript openfilebtn onclick function editor open some file and and opens a file when the user clicks this button imports a string of content into a client side storage file if the file already exists it will be overwritten useful if you want to inject a bunch of content via ajax will also run open after import automatically note this does not import files on your server or machine yet this simply looks in localstorage where epiceditor stores drafts javascript importfilebtn onclick function editor importfile some file  imported markdown nfancy huh and and imports a file when the user clicks this button returns the plain text of the client side storage file or if given a type  will return the content in the specified type if you leave both parameters null it will return the current document s content in plain text the supported export file types are note this does not export files to your server or machine yet this simply looks in

newname and and prompts a user and renames a file on button click manually saves a file to client side storage localstorage by default epiceditor will save continuously every ms by default but if you set autosave in the options to false or to longer intervals it s useful to manually save note this does not save files to your server or machine yet this simply looks in localstorage where epiceditor stores drafts javascript savefilebtn onclick function editor save deletes a client side storage file note this does not remove files from your server or machine yet this simply looks in localstorage where epiceditor stores drafts javascript removefilebtn onclick function editor remove example md if no name is given it returns an object containing the names and metadata of all client side storage file objects if a name is specified it will return just the metadata of that single file object if excludecontent is true it will remove the content from the returned object this is useful when you just want a list of files or get some meta data if excludecontent is false default  it ll return a content property per file in plain text format note this does not get files from your server or machine yet this simply looks in localstorage where epiceditor stores drafts javascript var files editor getfiles for x in files console log file and x and and returns the name of each file sets up an event handler callback for a specified event for all event types see the events section below javascript editor on unload  function console log editor was removed fires an event programatically similar to jquery s trigger javascript editor emit unload and and triggers the handler provided in the on method above allows you to remove all listeners for an event or just the specified one javascript editor removelistener unload and and the handler above would no longer fire puts the editor into preview mode javascript previewbtn onclick function editor preview puts the editor into edit mode javascript editbtn onclick function editor edit puts focus on the editor or previewer whichever is visible works just like doing plain old javascript and input focus like someinput focus the benefit of using this method however is that it handles cross browser issues and also will focus on the visible view edit or preview showeditorbtn onclick function editorwrapper style display block and and switch from being hidden from the user editor focus and and focus and allow user to start editing right away puts the editor into fullscreen mode a callback will be fired after the entering fullscreen animation completes some browsers will be nearly instant while others mainly chrome take ms before this event is fired if already in fullscreen the callback will fire immediately note due to browser security restrictions calling enterfullscreen programmatically like this will not trigger native fullscreen native fullscreen can only be triggered by a user interaction like mousedown or keyup javascript enterfullscreenbtn onclick function editor enterfullscreen function console log welcome to fullscreen mode closes fullscreen mode a callback will be fired after the exiting fullscreen animation completes if already not in fullscreen the callback will fire immediately javascript exitfullscreenbtn onclick function editor exitfullscreen function console log finished closing fullscreen reflow allows you to reflow the editor in it s container for example let s say you increased the height of your wrapping element and want the editor to resize too you could call reflow and the editor will resize to fit you can pass it one of two strings as the first parameter to constrain the reflow to either width or height it also provides you with a callback parameter if you d like to do something after the resize is finished the callback will return the new width and and or height in an object additionally you can also listen for the reflow event this will also give you back the new size note if you call reflow or reflow width and you have a fluid width container epiceditor will no longer be fluid because doing a reflow on the width sets an inline style on the editor javascript and and for an editor that takes up the whole browser window window onresize function editor reflow and and constrain the reflow to just height somediv resizeheighthandle function editor reflow height and and same as the first example but this has a callback window onresize function editor reflow function data console log width  data width  height  data height created removed or updated below is a complete list of currently supported events and their description table cellspacing  class event table th event name and th th description and th theming is easy in epiceditor there are three different iframe s which means styles wont leak between the chrome of epiceditor previewer or editor each one is like it s own web page in the themes directory you ll see base  preview  and editor the base styles are for the chrome of the editor which contains elements such as the utility bar containing the icons the editor is the styles for the contents of editor iframe and the preview styles are applied to the preview iframe the html of a generated editor excluding contents looks like this iframe id epiceditor instance id html head link type text and css id rel stylesheet href epiceditor and themes and base and epiceditor css media screen and head body iframe id epiceditor editor frame html head link type text and css rel stylesheet href epiceditor and themes and editor and epic dark css media screen and head body contenteditable true and body and html and iframe iframe id epiceditor previewer frame html head link type text and css rel stylesheet href epiceditor and themes and preview and github css media screen and head body and div and body and html and iframe span title toggle preview mode class epiceditor toggle btn epiceditor toggle preview btn and span span title enter fullscreen class epiceditor fullscreen btn and span and div and div and body and html and iframe unlike the chrome of base or editor  the theming of the preview is done by css class so that you can reuse epiceditor s theme to make your rendered page match your previewed first include your chosen theme on every page link rel stylesheet href and epiceditor and themes and preview and github css you may need to adjust the path mark your rendered content with epiceditor preview epiceditor is set up to allow you to use any parser that accepts and returns a string this means you can use any flavor of markdown process textile or even create a simple html editor and previewer parser false the possibilities are endless just make the parser available and pass its parsing function to the epiceditor setting and you should be all set you can output plain text or html here s an example of a parser that could remove bad words from the preview var editor new epiceditor parser function str var blacklist foo  bar  baz return str split map function word and and if the word exists replace with asterisks if blacklist indexof word  return return word join load var editor new epiceditor parser function str return str wikihtml load for even more customization and optimization you can replace the default built in processor on build running jake build parser path and to and parser js will

28242126, reapp is everything you need to build amazing apps with react a collection of packages that work together our ui kit and a cli that scaffolds your app and includes a server and build system installation is done through npm npm install g reapp generate a new base reapp stack with reapp new name reapp run the cli has three main functions creating new apps running them and building them for release note that when you run your app it will run in development mode by default which is much slower but easier to debug run it in production mode to get a feel for real world performance cli usage usage reapp command new name creates a directory with a new reapp starter scaffold run runs a reapp application with express and webpack dev server build builds a reapp application to a bundle in and build debug use this for opening issues the build and run commands take a variety of options to help ease your development such as usage reapp run options d debug output extra information for debugging p port number specify a port number h host host specify hostname b bind address specify bind address if different from host e env env specify an environment t tool tool specify a webpack devtool usage reapp build options d debug output extra information for debugging no assets only build the js no js only build the assets the run command has a few options to help you out reapp run d debug to output information on how it s running your app reapp run e production env production to run your app in production mode which is much faster reapp run t source map tool source map to have full sourcemaps rather than the eval style sourcemaps we default to if you run into a blank page after reapp run  try these commands npm install save react    npm install save reapp ui    npm install save reapp kit    you also have the same flags available to build commands the build command is used once you re ready to deploy your app to either the web or to cordova for now we provide two types of builds reapp build by default sets the platform to web  for mobile sites reapp build ios targets cordova ios devices when you run reapp build you ll notice a new and build folder where your assets have been copied to for example a reapp build ios will build to and build and ios reapp build goes to and build and web it will also copy your assets for you here s an example of running reapp build ios and assets and shared and and build and ios and assets and ios and and build and ios and assets and ios and index html webpack inserts css and js references and build and ios and index html this allows a lot of flexibility you can share assets between builds or have exclusive ones for a platform leave an asset in the base and assets folder and it won t be copied at all but you can still require it within your app a good case for shared assets is your cordova config xml leave it in and assets and shared and it ll output for all your builds see more on custom builds custom builds and components index html index html and shared and config optional by default and app and app js is your entry point everything in the app folder should be pretty self explanatory and assets contains static assets as explained in the running building running and building section in general you ll place your assets into shared or the specific platform subdirectory find docs for it in the repo but it also should be pretty easy to understand if you place a build webpack js or run webpack js in your and config dir the reapp cli will use these configs when you run reapp build or reapp run to see some example configs check out the files in the and config folder of the there are a number of pieces we ve included in a reapp let s explore a few of them in order of when you ll encounter them in your codebase think of this as a tour of a reapp app giving an introduction to packages as we encounter them you also have an entry point defined as app and app js this starts your app the most important part here is the routing lets start there load all your stuff from theme to store to actions then you run your routes which are done using reapp routes this simplifies routing down to the bare minimum note that your routes will automatically look into and components to find files based on the name you give them an example routes require route home  and  route sub and and and components and home jsx and and and components and home and sub jsx this is the reapp routes syntax the key to note here is the require that is passed to the routes function at the top level which is how it dynamically requires your components based on the route tree the next theme we require is the and app and theme and index js themes are loaded by calling reapp theme and passing in an object with styles constants and animations you can just use the included ios theme but we ve included the and app and theme folder as an example of how you can easily customize themes this is the first react component in your structure as defined in your routes notice when we export it we wrap it with reapp this helper function will provide the this context variables that you ve set up when you loaded your theme actions and store if you decide to use all of those it will also pass props to your home route this props child and this props viewlistprops you can see that they correspond to any children routes and to properties needed to be on a viewlist that will handle those routes reapp pack takes in an object that lets you configure your builds it provides you with can override them if you need custom webpack loaders reapp run looks for and config and run config js reapp build looks for and config and build config js reapp build platform looks for and config and build platform config js place a config in your and config and run and build platform config js to override the default here s an example config module exports entry and app and app js  devtool none  target web  env production  linkmodules true debug true separatestylesheet true minify true you can also provide the following options that are passed to webpack loaders array modulesdirectories array prefetch array reapp wasn t built purposefully to be a framework instead it started as a ui kit from that kit two apps were built while this isn t a lot it was enough to see repetition between the two that could be extracted from those two apps over a period of months we extracted a set of packages ensuring to keep each of them completely independent it was an experiment in seeing if a framework was necessary what we found was this if you can subscribe to a certain file structure you can avoid the framework with that file structure we can provide helpers via a cli bootstrap your app in one command and you have a mature build system built in without having to do anything really reapp is simple you could even just use the ui kit and roll your own app we just went through that headache and decided to make it easier to avoid it if you like how we make apps we have two example apps you can check the source to for getting syntax highlighting snippets and linting that works with babel

supported by apple themselves ios universal framework mk   an xcode project template to build universal arm arm and simulator frameworks for ios by karl stenerud  i haven t been able to solve the problem of deeply nested projects within projects but the new python scripts have been working in my other projects for over a year now and are quite stable for  of use cases unfortunately i don t have the time to solve the last  of use cases as a compromise i ve created a branch mk which contains the shell script version of the build system if mk doesn t work for your unique case give mk a try development will continue in order to keep things working for the other  of use cases if you can help please feel free to contact me or send pull requests all scripting is done in python now all template development happens within the devel directory build py builds the templates and all template source files are in src you can now update existing projects to use the newest build scripts running the updateproject py script will replace your project s universal framework build script with the script in devel and src and buildfw py before upgrading please back up your project file if your project was built using mk  or earlier delete the first two universal framework build scripts the first will be right after target dependencies and starts with the following or something close set e set and u if ufwmasterscriptrunning nothing for the slave script to do exit  set u the second script is after copy bundle resources and starts with the following or something close note that this script may not exist in very early versions of the framework project headersroot srcroot and productname frameworkheadersdir builtproductsdir and wrappername and versions and frameworkversion and headers only header files expected at this point publicheaders find frameworkheadersdir and not type d  and dev and null and sed e s and g the final script the one you want to keep will start with something similar to the first script you deleted now proceed with the next steps below make sure the top of the run script phase for the universal framework script starts with the following comment tag build script if it doesn t add it in close your project run the project update script from shell and updateproject py and projects and myproj and myproj xcodeproj and project pbxproj reopen your project the project update script will create a backup project pbxproj orig of the old project file to disable this behavior use the n switch the script now requires you to select which kind of framework normal or embedded you will be creating using the configframeworktype configuration variable only the selected framework type will be created and shown to the user note xcode requires the normal framework dir to exist so when building an embedded framework the script simply creates a symlink to the copy inside the embeddedframework be sure to tell your users not to to copy the regular framework symlink by mistake when you build normally by selecting build or cmd b  the project will no longer build a universal framework it will build for the current architecture only to build a universal framework you must select archive from the product menu upon completing the archive build it will automatically open the folder containing the fully built framework this cuts the compilation time down by  and  since it no longer has to do a full build process when building as a dependency since archive is not a supported xcodebuild build action you must specify the env variable ufwaction archive in your xcodebuild command to build it as a universal framework to avoid opening the destination folder when building from command line set the env variable ufwopenbuilddir false in your xcodebuild command the initial beta version had  scripts a clean script and a build script mk  has  scripts with the new build process there is only need for one script when xcode creates the initial header and module file for a framework the header file won t be included as a member of the framework target this is a bug in xcode it does the same thing with mac frameworks  so you need to do this manually in build phases under copy headers  click the and and add the header then drag it to the public section the run script build phases will have the option show environment variables in build log checked a bug in xcode causes it to ignore the template setting and leave it checked always this can cause issues when diagnosing a build failure because xcode will only show the first  log entries in a build phase most of which are taken up by spitting out all of the environment variables so be sure to turn it off manually so to sum up when starting a new framework project always do the following manually add the header file it creates to your build target and mark it public uncheck show environment variables in build log in all run script build phases why a framework  distributing libraries in a developer friendly manner is tricky you need to include not only the library itself but also any public include files resources scripts etc apple s solution to this problem is frameworks which are basically folders that follow a standard structure to include everything required to use a library unfortunately in disallowing dynamically linked libraries in ios apple also removed static ios framework creation functionality in xcode xcode is still technically capable of building frameworks for ios and with a little tweaking it can be re enabled static frameworks are perfectly acceptable for packaging code intended for the app store despite appearances it s just a static library at the core kinds of frameworks  a dynamic framework is designed to be installed in your operating system and shared by many programs by default xcode only supports dynamic frameworks and only for mac since you can t use dynamic frameworks in ios a static framework gets linked into your app like a static library would however xcode doesn t include support for static frameworks these templates add in that support frameworks are superior to libraries because they can include code as well as public headers in a single package although frameworks are an improvement over libraries xcode ignores any resources contained within frameworks so if you have xibs images sounds or other files in your framework xcode won t see them an embedded framework is a way to trick xcode into seeing the included resources as far as xcode is concerned they are simply folders and so there are a few minor issues with embedded frameworks they don t show up in the products group when you delete an embedded framework from a project xcode will not delete the outer folder xx embeddedframework  so if you try to re add later it will complain you need to manually delete the xx embeddedframework folder manually using finder things get a little tricky when you have a framework project as a dependency if your framework has resources that the parent project needs you may need to manually add the resources to the parent or sibling project choosing which template system to use  in this distribution are two template systems each with their strengths and weaknesses you should choose whichever one best suits your needs and constraints or just install both the biggest difference is that xcode can t build real frameworks unless you install the static framework xcspec file inside the xcode app which might be a dealbreaker for some this applies to the project  not the framework note both types will build the exact same binary the only difference is in how xcode treats the project i don t want to modify xcode fake framework i m just distributing the final framework binary not the project either kind i m distributing my framework project to other developers who may not want to modify xcode fake framework i need to set up the framework project as a dependency of another project in a workspace or as a child project real framework or fake framework  using the framework trick see below the fake framework is based on the well known relocatable object file bundle hack which tricks xcode into building something that mostly resembles a framework but is really a bundle the fake framework template takes this a step further using some scripting to generate a real static framework based on a static library rather than a relocatable object file however the framework s project still defines it to be of type wrapper cfbundle  which makes it a second class citizen according to xcode so while it produces a proper static framework that works just as well as a real static framework things can get tricky when you have dependencies if you re just setting up a standalone project then you re not using dependencies so there s no problem if however you use project dependencies such as in workspaces  xcode won t be happy the fake framework won t show up in the list when you click the and button under link binary with libraries in your main application project you can manually drag it from products under your fake framework project to add the dependency note in older versions of xcode you d get warnings like the following warning skipping file and somewhere and myframework framework unexpected file type wrapper cfbundle in frameworks libraries build phase this would be followed by linker errors for anything in your fake framework as of xcode    this doesn t seem to happen anymore if you do encounter this issue you can work around it by adding a framework switch with your framework s name in other linker flags in the project that uses the framework framework myframework it won t get rid of the warning which is annoying but it does link properly the real framework is real in every sense of the word it is a true static framework made by re introducing specifications that apple left out of xcode in order to be able to build a real framework project you must install an xcspec file inside the xcode installation if you are releasing a project rather than the built product that builds a real framework anyone who wishes to build that framework must also install the xcspec file using the install script in this distribution so that their xcode can understand the target type note if all you re doing is distributing the fully built framework and not the framework s project then the end user doesn t need to install anything i ve submitted a report to apple in the hopes that they ll update the specification files in xcode but that could take awhile upgrading from previous ios universal framework versions  if you are upgrading from ios universal framework mk  or earlier and were using the real static framework  and are still using xcode    or earlier please run uninstalllegacy sh first to remove any patches that were previously applied to xcode then run install sh and restart xcode if you are using xcode   or later just run install sh and restart installing the template system  to install run the install sh script in either the real framework or fake framework folder or both now restart xcode and you ll see static ios framework or fake static ios framework under framework library when creating a new project to uninstall run the uninstall sh script and restart xcode creating an ios framework project   start a new project  for the project type choose static ios framework or fake static ios framework  which is under framework library  optionally choose to include unit tests  add the auto generated header file to the public section of the copy headers build phase workaround for xcode bug  turn off show environment variables in build log for both run script build phases workaround for xcode bug  add your classes resources etc with your framework as the target  any header files that need to be available to other projects must be declared public to do so go to build phases in your framework target expand copy headers  then drag any header files you want to make public from the project or private section to the public section  any static libraries or static frameworks that you d like to have linked into your framework must be included in the link binary with libraries build phase be careful doing this however as it can cause linker issues if the users of your framework also try to include the same library in their project for other purposes building your ios framework   select your framework s scheme ios device target  under product  select archive  when the build finishes it will open the folder containing the framework and embedded framework variants in finder there will be two folders in the build location your framework framework and your framework embeddedframework if your framework has only code and no resources like images scripts xibs core data momd files etc  you can distribute your framework framework to your users and it will just work if you have included resources in your framework you must distribute your framework embeddedframework using an ios framework  ios frameworks are basically the same as regular dynamic mac os x frameworks except they are statically linked to add a framework to your project simply drag it into your project when including headers from your framework remember to use angle bracket syntax rather than quotes for example with framework myframework import myframework and myclass h template development  if you re interested in tinkering with the templates themselves i ve changed the way they are generated there are now template metatemplates which are used to build the xcode templates inside the devel folder there is a script build py  which rebuilds the templates under fake framework and real framework the source files are under src cleanfw py the project clean script the first script in a framework project buildfw py the project build script the second script in a framework project fakeframeworktemplateinfo plist the fake framework metatemplate realframeworktemplateinfo plist the real framework metatemplate troubleshooting  if xcode can t find the header files from your framework you ve likely forgotten to make them public see step  in creating an ios framework project if someone who has not installed ios universal framework in their development environment attempts to build a universal framework project for a real framework not a fake framework  they ll get the following error target specifies product type com apple product type framework static  but there s no such product type for the iphonesimulator platform xcode requires some modification in order to be able to build true ios static frameworks see the two diff files in the real framework folder of this repository for the gory details  so please install it on all development machines that will build your real static framework projects this isn t needed for users of your framework only for builders of the framework sometimes xcode gets confused and loads the wrong active settings the first thing to try is restarting xcode if it still fails xcode generated a bad project this can happen with any kind of project due to a bug in xcode  if this happens you ll need to start over and create a new project the first time you build your framework target xcode may complain about missing folders during the linking phase ld warning directory not found for option l and users and myself and library and developer and xcode and deriveddata and myframework ccahfoccjqiognaqraesrxdyqcne and build and products and debug iphoneos if this happens simply clean and rebuild the target and the warnings should xcode builds managed object model files differently in a framework project than it does in an application project instead of creating a momd directory containing versioninfo plist and the mom file it simply creates the mom file in the root directory this means that when initializing your nsmanagedobjectmodel from a model in an embedded framework you must specify your model url with an extension of mom rather than momd nsurl modelurl nsbundle mainbundle urlforresource mymodel withextension mom since static frameworks are statically linked the linker strips out any code it thinks is not being used unfortunately the linker does not check xib files and so if a class is referenced only in a xib and not in objective c code the linker will drop that class from the final executable this is a linker issue not a framework issue it also happens when you build a static library apple s built in framworks don t suffer this problem because they are dynamically loaded at runtime and the complete unstripped dynamic library exists in the ios device s firmware there are two ways around this  have end users of your framework disable linker optimizations by adding objc and allload to other linker flags in their project  put a code reference to the class inside another class in your framework that always gets used for example suppose you have mytextfield  which is getting stripped by the linker suppose you also have myviewcontroller  which uses mytextfield in its xib file and doesn t get stripped you could do the following in mytextfield and void forcelinkerload in myviewcontroller and void initialize mytextfield forcelinkerload they will still need to add objc to their linker settings but won t need to force allload option  is more work for you but if done right it saves the end user from having to disable linker optimizations causing object file bloat just to use your framework this happens when you use a fake framework project as a dependency in a workspace or as a child project real framework projects don t have this issue even though the framework project produces a proper static framework xcode only looks at the project file which says it s a bundle and so it issues a warning during the dependency check and then skips it during the linker phase you can get it to link properly by manually adding a command to link your framework during the linker phase add a command to link your framework in other linker flags in the project that depends on the framework framework myframework you ll still get the warning but it won t fail in the linker phase anymore unfortunately due to the way xcode works the real framework and fake framework templates handle included static libraries and frameworks differently the real framework template follows correct static library procedure not linking other static libraries and frameworks into the final product the fake framework template tricks xcode into thinking that it s building a relocatable object file and so the linking phase treats it as if it were building an executable linking all static code sources into the final binary although it doesn t check for missing object code to get the real framework behavior you should include only the header files from the library and framework in your framework project not the static library or framework itself if your static library or static framework contains a module with only category code no full class implementations  the linker will get confused and will leave the code out of the final binary since it s not present in the final product you ll get unrecognized selector exceptions when any call is made to those category methods to get around this put a dummy class into the module containing the category code the linker seeing a full objective c class will link the module in including the category code to make this easier to do import someconcreteclass and myadditions h import loadablecategory h makecategoriesloadable someconcreteclassmyadditions implementation someconcreteclass myadditions you will also need to add objc to the other linker flags build setting in any project that uses the framework if you make a new static framework or static library target with unit tests in xcode   it will crash when you try to run the unit tests thread  excbadaccess code  address x  x  dyldbootstrap start this is due to a bug in lldb you can run the unit tests using gdb instead by editing your scheme selecting test  and from the info tab changing debugger from lldb to gdb the first incarnation it used a bunch of script hackery to cobble together a fake framework it exploited the bundle target setting its type to a relocatable object file this version took advantage of the template system to do most of the work that the script used to do everything including the script was embedded in the template this version does away with the relocatable object hackery and builds a true static framework with all the abilities of an os x static framework this solves a number of linker unit testing and workspace inclusion issues that plagued the previous hacky implementations it also includes the concept of the embeddedframework which allows you to include resources with your framework in a way that xcode understands josh weinberg also added some tweaks to make it build in the proper build directory with scheme controlled configuration and behave better as a subproject dependency it now requires some small modifications to xcode s specification files in order to support true static frameworks and thus comes with an install and uninstall script this version gives you the choice of installing the real framework template or the fake framework template both come with an install script but only the real framework installer needs to modify xcode this also fixes some issues that the fake framework had in mk  such as the curious behavior of embedding the full path to the compiled files within the files themselves resulting in warnings when building with that framework this version does away with the extra target and script everything is self contained in the framework target and the framework under the products group is actually the universal framework no more debug univesal or release universal folders you can build and clean like you would in any other project as well the fake framework template now builds a proper static library instead of a relocatable object file although xcode still doesn t believe that it s real this version makes the xcode modifications for real static frameworks safer by simply adding an extra specification file instead of patching existing this version was supposed to be the one that no longer modified xcode but alas xcode behaves differently depending on where the xcspec file gets installed take a guess at which location doesn t work wtfxcode so instead this version basically handles the new install location of xcode  templates now build armv and armv by default instead of just armv note if you previously installed real framework supprt under the broken mk  i e if you installed it on feb th or feb th before   am pst   run uninstalllegacy sh to uninstall the xcspec file from your home dir then reinstall this version replaces the bash scripts with python scripts this gives a lot more control over the build process to build the universal version of your framework you must now use the archive command rather than the build command build only builds for the current architecture to

44513129, what is dynamicapk dynamicapk is a solution that contains framework tool and configuration to implement multi apk and dex dynamic loading it can help reorganize android project configuration and development model to achieve sub projects parallel development in the form of android studio module  while supporting hot fix repairing online bug  on demand loading seldom used modules all dynamically loaded modules not only contain code but also contain resources if you need dynamicapk is already uesed in ctrip android app simplified chinese version ctrip is the biggest online travel agency in china while  percent of orders are from app less transformation effort no activity and fragment and resource proxy stuff dynamicapk doesn t need activity or fragment proxy to manage their life cycle modules resources are processed by modified aapt so resource reference in r java is not different with normal android project developers can maintain their original development paradigm parallel development speed up compilation speed up app booting multidex solution offered by google will execute dex decompression dexopt load operation in the main thread that means a very long process while users will see significant long black screen and more likely to encounter the anr by dynamicapk app loads only the necessary modules other modules are loaded on demand hot fix code and resource on demand module code and resource downloading and loading heavy develpment paradigm transformation use that instead of this  activity should inherit from their proxy avtivity the proxy activity manage life cycle restrictions of starting activity within module apk doesn t support service and broadcastreceiver heavy develpment paradigm transformation changes the usage of resources myresources getresource me class instead of context getresources use fragment as ui container each page is implemented in fragment instead of activity so you need use url mapping to start new page not tested in released app doesn t support service and broadcastreceiver very interesting framework droidplugin can start totally independent app not installed in your app the features are more suitable for qihu security app because the bundle apk is totally irrelevant to host apk doesn t support custom nitification we focus on aapt javac proguard and dex process the key of dynamic loading is about two things java compilation is nothing special while class loading needs some hacking android s dexclassloader has some restrictions so we use android s system pathclassloader pathclassloader has a member pathlist as the name suggests it is essentially a list to load classes from each dex path in the list at runtime so we can add our dynamically loaded dex at the head of the list in fact google s official multidex library is also implemented by the method the following snippet shows the details multidex java private static void install classloader loader list file additionalclasspathentries

aapt txt aapt command line reference some of them deserve special attention i add an existing package to base include set this parameter is to add an existing package in the dependency path in android the compilation of resources also need rely on android jar android jar is not an ordinary jar package which contains the existing sdk library class compiled resources and resource index file resources arsc similarly we can also use this parameter references an existing apk packages as dependencies resources to participate in the compilation g a file to output proguard options into in resource compilation component class and method references will result in runtime reflection invocation so this kind of symbol can not be confused g parameter will derive classes and interfaces found in the resource compilation process that must be kept it will participate to the confusion in the late stage as an additional configuration file j specify where to output r java resource constant definitions in android all resources will be generated as corresponding constant id the id will be merged to r java file resource id in r java is a four byte int type actually it consists of three fields the first byte represents the package the second byte represents type three and four bytes represent real id e g and and android jar resources packageid is x public static final int cancel x and and user app resources packageid is xf public static final int zipcode xffe we modifed aapt to provide each module different packageid so there will be no conflict to add new aapt apk module parameter as previously mentioned we specified for each module project unique packageid field so we can find where to find and load resources in the resource loading section there will be more details to add new aapt public r path parameter android system resources can be referenced by its fully qualified name android r to refer specific source if we use base package name r for modules to refer public app common resources that means we need modify every existed resource reference code it s error prone and less transparent in the future development we add public r path parameter to specify base r s location and make copy of common resource id into modules r java resource loading is processed by assetmanager and resources class we can access them in the context context java and return an assetmanager instance for your application s package and public abstract assetmanager getassets and return a resources instance for your application s package and public abstract resources getresources they are two abstract methods implementation is in contextimpl class after initialization of contextimpl class objects each subclass of context such as activity service and other components can access resources by these two methods contextimpl java private final resources mresources override public assetmanager getassets return getresources getassets override public resources getresources return mresources since we allocate packageid the first byte of resource id by aapt to know where to find resource s apk we override these two methods to find specific resource and there is a hidden method addassetpath in assetmanager so we can add a resource path to assetmanager add an additional set of assets to the asset manager this can be either a directory or zip file not for use by applications returns the cookie of the added asset or  on failure public final int addassetpath string path    synchronized this        int res addassetpathnative path        makestringblocks mstringblocks        return res we just need to reflect this method then add all apk s location to assetmanager assetmanager will finish the resource loading by compiled resources arsc resources within apk to achieve seamless experience we need last step using the instrumentation to take over all creation of activity  service and other components activity service and other system components will be loaded in the main thread by android app activitythread activitythread class has a member minstrumentation that is responsible for creating activity and other operations so it s the best candidate for loading our modified resource class every time the system creates activity we replace its mresources by our delegateresources that will know how to load resources done use parameter apk

mousewheel up and down arrow keys and spacebar the spacebar scrolls faster than the arrow keys and holding shift while pressing space will scroll backwards a custom scrollbar is also included which allows click and drag scrolling the scrollbar is enabled by default the plugin also allows rotating the entire page using css transforms this can be done either along a path or around the current position in browsers without css transform support all rotations are ignored but paths are still followed this means the plugin works with graceful degradation in all browsers as of version   the plugin also allows you to animate the scroll position to a given waypoint in the path are you using jquery scroll path on any of your sites  i d love to hear about it and i might include links here for showcasing the plugin being used in the wild using the plugin  this guide aims to help you with getting started using the plugin in addition to reading this it s recommended that you check out the marked section of the script and demo js file for a usage example note this plugin requires jquery   and  to start drawing your path we need to get the path object from the plugin this is done by calling fn scrollpath getpath  which returns the object for anyone who has used canvas before you can think of the path object the same way as the canvas context object you can also change the default scrolling speeds by adding an object as a parameter with scrollspeed and rotationspeed properties set var path fn scrollpath getpath  scrollspeed  and and default is  rotationspeed math pi and  and and default is math pi and  and and use the various path drawing methods below on the path variable note that the rotation speed only applies when rotating around a set position moves the center of the screen to a specified coordinate this is done in a single step i e the screen jumps to the given point draws a straight line from the current position to the given point draws an arc with its center at coordinate centerx centery with the given radius the start and end angles are in radians and the counterclockwise boolean decides which direction the path is drawn between the angles if the starting point of the arc isn t the same as the end point of the preceding path a straight line is automatically drawn between the points rotates the screen around the current position to the given radian angle these rotations aren t added to the path if the browser doesn t support css transforms the optional options parameter takes an object with the properties rotate  callback and name the rotate property is used to rotate to a given radian angle when moving along the path the callback property lets you specify a function that will be called every time the end point of the path is reached specifying the name property allows you to set a reference to the end point of the path which can later be used as a target for the scrollto method here is an example of a named path rotating a full rotation along a line and firing an alert at the end path lineto  rotate  math pi callback function alert you ve reached the end name mypath once you re done drawing your path on the path object all that s left to do is to initialize the plugin on a container element which contains all the elements you want to scroll around when you re doing this there are three more settings that can be changed drawpath  wraparound and scrollbar the drawpath boolean decides whether a canvas overlay with the path should be drawn this can be used to make it easier for you to see exactly how the path you ve made looks and should probably only be used for debugging purposes this is set to false by default setting wraparound to true will make the path loop which means that once you reach the end of the scroll path and go down another step you ll scroll back to the beginning this works the other way around too this is also set to false by default the scrollbar setting enables or disables the scroll bar which is enabled by default here s an example your container element scrollpath drawpath true wraparound true scrollbar false once you initialize the plugin it will automatically center the screen to the first point in the path while scrolling the plugin will also always make sure that the center of the screen follows the path also whenever the window is resized the plugin makes sure it re centers itself you should now have everything set up and ready to go  fn scrollpath scrollto  name  duration easing complete once the plugin has been initialized you can use the scrollto method above to animate or jump with duration set to  to given points in the path these points are specified with the name parameter which you can set on the different path end points while creating the path fn scrollpath scrollto  mypath   easeinoutsine  function alert animation complete changelog  version        minor bug and performance fixes added support for path command chaining version       added support for programmatically scrolling and animating to specified points in the path

loaded within your site along with a list of the user s repos syte has dribbble integration which means that when someone clicks on a link that points to a user s dribbble profile the profile is loaded within your site along with the user s latest shots syte has instagram integration which means that you can show your instagram pictures within your site like a profile syte has foursquare integration which means that you can show your foursquare check ins within your site like a profile syte has last fm integration which means that when someone clicks on a link that points to a user s last fm profile the profile information will be loaded directly in the site along with a listing of the most recently scrobbled tracks syte has bitbucket integration which means that when someone clicks on a link that points to a user s bitbucket profile the profile is loaded within your site along with a list of the user s repos syte has tent io integration which means that you can show your tent io public posts within your site like a profile syte has steam integration which means that you can show your steam community profile within your site syte has stackoverflow integration which means that you can show your stackoverflow profile within your site syte has flickr integration which means that you can show your flickr photos within your site syte has linkedin integration which means that you can show your linkedin profile information within your site syte is responsive which means that it scales down to a mobile device screen size spin js fgnass github com and spin js there are a few steps in order to get syte configured but don t worry they are pretty easy note i recommend you branching your fork and not checking in sensitive settings to github warning do not place oauth keys and tokens in a public repository there are a few things that are defaulted to have my information so you have the initial structure of the site to start off change the pictures to have your picture navigate to syte static imgs and replace pic png with your picture and favicon ico with your favicon in this case i use my picture as well please make sure you keep the same sizes pic png is xpx and favicon ico is xpx then make some text and link changes open base html located in syte templates base html and make the following changes  change the meta description content to have a description about you  change the meta keywords content to have keywords about you  change the title tag to have your name  inside the header tag change the h tag to have your name  inside the header tag change the h tag to have a short description about you  inside the nav tag change the twitter link href to point to your twitter profile if you don t have twitter just remove that whole line  inside the nav tag change the github link href to point to your github profile if you don t have github just remove that whole line  inside the nav tag change the dribbble link href to point to your dribbble profile if you don t have dribbble just remove that whole line  inside the nav tag change the steam link href to point to your steam community profile if you don t have steam just remove that

mobile nav div change the h link text to have your domain name or your name then pick your adjacent color and change the adjacent color hex value in variables less located in syte static less variables less make sure the color you chose is not used by anyone on the list up above if you want blue pick a different shade of blue there are hundreds out there syte uses tumblr or wordpress for blogging once you have the apikey from tumblr you have to enter it in sytesettings py located in syte sytesettings py once you open that file enter the key under tumblrapikey  also please enter your tumblr url under tumblrblogurl see the example on how it should be formatted open syte sytesettings py and under wordpressblogurl enter ther url of your wordpress com blog also under blogplatform set it to wordpress next you will need your access tokens on the bottom of that page there is a link called create my access token click on that once you are done you will be given the other two pieces of

linkedintoken if you want to turn off the linkedin integration just set linkedinintegrationenabled to false now that you have everything setup and ready to go we will be able to run the project locally and deploy to heroku or aws with the instructions below please note that these instructions are for mac which should be the same for linux systems if you have problems with these instructions on windows let me know or send a pull request running locally is really easy if you are on a mac since you already have some stuff installed out of the box to start off install these python packages once you have those two installed go to your syte directory and run the following commands mkvirtualenv syte workon syte syte pip install use mirrors r requirements txt python manage py runserver after npm is installed you need to install two node packages less and uglify js to do that run the following commands sudo npm install less g sudo npm install uglify js g note windows users be sure to create the directories syte static css and syte static js min first if it doesn t already exist then whenever you want to release a new version of static update the compressrevisionnumber in syte settings py and run the compress python command from your syte directory python compress py this will create a minified version of your css in syte static css and the minified version of your javascript in syte static js min deploying to heroku is extremely easy and free that s why i chose it over amazon or similar that s another fork i would love to see different deployment instructions maybe to an amazon ec micro instance  change the deploymentmode value to prod in sytesettings py located in syte sytesettings py  change the siterooturi value to your heroku app url in sytesettings py see the available example to how it should be formatted  change the deploymentmode value to prod in sytesettings py located in syte sytesettings py  change the siterooturi value to your aws app url in sytesettings py see the available example to how it should be formatted  execute the eb start command to deploy a sample application to aws once this command completes execute eb status verbose and confirm that the sample application is running at the provided url  let s make sure our configurations are right first open and ebextensions and syte config and confirm the settings here you should not have to update anything second open the and elasticbeanstalk and opensettings xxx env where xxx env is the name of your environment update this by updating djangosettingsmodule syte settings staticfiles syte and static wsgipath syte and wsgi py  to make sure the above changes are not reverted execute eb update  deploy the repo to aws by executing git aws push this command can be rerun whenever you have changes that you want to deploy  execute eb status verbose or monitor the provisioning process on aws website to troubleshoot go to the elasticbeanstalk section of aws get a snapshot of the logs and review them for errors there are plans for several services to be added in the these services is a good place to start when looking for ways to help also if you would like to add support for a new service you might find the help get started and where your new code might go etc can be a useful resource when starting out with the project and trying to understand roughly how it

11493, kestrel is based on blaine cook s starling simple distributed message queue with added features and bulletproofing as well as the scalability offered by actors and the jvm each server handles a set of reliable ordered message queues when you put a cluster of these servers together with no cross communication  and pick a server at random whenever you do a set or get  you end up with a reliable loosely ordered message queue in many situations loose ordering is sufficient dropping the requirement on cross communication makes it horizontally scale to infinity and beyond no multicast no clustering no elections  no coordination at all no talking for more information about what it is and how to use it check out kestrel has a mailing list here author s address robey pointer robeypointer gmail com we ve deprecated kestrel because internally we ve shifted our attention to an alternative project based on distributedlog and we no longer have the resources to contribute fixes or accept pull requests while kestrel is a great solution up to a certain point simple fast durable and easy to deploy  it hasn t been able to cope with twitter s massive scale in terms of number of tenants qps operability diversity of workloads etc or operating environment an aurora cluster without persistent storage kestrel is it runs on the jvm so it can take advantage of the hard work people have put into java performance currently about  lines of scala because it relies on netty a rough equivalent of danger s ziggurat or ruby s eventmachine and because scala is extremely expressive durable queues are stored in memory for speed but logged into a journal on disk so that servers can be shutdown or moved without losing any data reliable a client can ask to tentatively fetch an item from a queue and if that client disconnects from kestrel before confirming ownership of the item the item is handed to another client in this way crashing clients don t cause lost messages anti features  kestrel is not strongly ordered while each queue is strongly ordered on each machine a cluster will appear loosely ordered because clients pick a machine at random for each operation the end result should be mostly fair transactional this is not a database item ownership is transferred with acknowledgement but kestrel does not support grouping multiple operations into an atomic unit downloading it  the latest release is always on the homepage here or the latest development versions branches are on github building it  kestrel requires java  and sbt    presently some sbt plugins used by kestrel depend on that exact version of sbt on os x   you may have to hard code an annoying javahome to use java  export javahome and system and library and frameworks and javavm framework and versions and   and home building from source is easy sbt clean update package dist scala libraries and dependencies will be downloaded from maven repositories the first time you do a build the finished distribution will be in dist running it  you can run kestrel by hand in development mode via and dist and kestrel version and scripts and devel sh like all ostrich based servers it uses the stage property to determine which config file to load so devel sh sets dstage development when running it as a server a startup script is provided in dist and kestrel version and scripts and kestrel sh the script assumes you have daemon  a standard daemonizer for linux but also available the created archive kestrel version zip can be expanded into a place like and usr and local or wherever you like and executed within its own folder as a self contained package all dependent jars are included the current startup script however assumes that kestrel has been deployed to and usr and local and kestrel and current e g  as if by capistrano  and the startup script loads kestrel from that path the default configuration puts logfiles into and var and log and kestrel and and queue journal files into and var and spool and kestrel and the startup script logs extensive gc information to a file named stdout in the log folder if kestrel has problems starting up before it can initialize logging  it will usually appear in error in the same folder configuration  queue configuration is described in detail in docs and guide md an operational guide scala docs for the config variables are performance  several performance tests are included to run them first start up a kestrel instance sbt clean update package dist and dist and kestrel version and scripts and devel sh this test just spams a kestrel server with put operations to see how quickly it can absorb and journal them a sample run on a  macbook pro and dist and kestrel and scripts and load and put many n  put  items of  bytes to localhost  in  queues named spam using  clients finished in  msec   usec and put throughput transactions min   max       median   average   usec transactions distribution                                         this test has one producer that trickles out one item at a time and a pile of consumers fighting for each item it usually takes exactly as long as the number of items times the delay but is useful as a validation test to make sure kestrel works as advertised without blowing up a sample run on a  macbook pro and dist and kestrel and scripts and load and many clients many clients  items to localhost using  clients kill rate   at  msec and item received  items in  msec this test always takes about  seconds it s a load test instead of a speed test this test starts up one producer and one consumer and just floods items through kestrel as fast as it can a sample run on a  macbook pro and dist and kestrel and scripts and load and flood flood  threads each sending  items of kb through spam finished in  msec   usec and put throughput consumer s spun  times in misses this test starts up one producer and one consumer seeds the queue with a bunch of items to cause it to fall behind then does cycles of flooding items through the queue separated by pauses it s meant to test kestrel s behavior with a queue that s fallen behind and stays behind indefinitely to make sure the journal files are packed periodically without affecting performance too badly a sample run on a  macbook pro and dist and kestrel and scripts and load and packing c  q small packing  items of kb with  second pauses wrote  items starting at  cycle  wrote  items starting at  read  items in  msec consumer spun  times in misses cycle  wrote  items starting at  read  items in  msec consumer spun  times in misses cycle  wrote  items starting at  read  items in  msec consumer spun  times in misses read  items in  msec consumer spun  times in misses you can see the journals being packed in the kestrel log like many clients  this test is a load test instead of a speed test this test starts a producer and several consumers with the consumers occasionally forgetting to acknowledge an item that they ve read it verifies that the un acknowledged items are eventually handed off to another a sample run and dist and kestrel and scripts and load and leaky reader n  t  leaky reader  threads each

1760686, so you ve tried your hand at writing jquery plugins and you re comfortable putting together something that probably works awesome thing is you think there might be better ways you could be writing them you ve seen them done a number of different ways in the wild but aren t really sure what the differences between these patterns are or how to get started with them this project won t seek to provide a perfect solution to every possible pattern but will attempt to cover a simple template for beginners and above by using a basic defaults object simple constructor for assigning the element to work with and extending options with defaults and a lightweight wrapper around the constructor to avoid issues with multiple instantiations  include jquery  include plugin s code  call the plugin javascript element defaultpluginname propertyname a custom value the basic structure of the project is given in the following way    demo and     index html    dist and     jquery boilerplate js     jquery boilerplate min js    src and     jquery boilerplate coffee     jquery boilerplate js    editorconfig    gitignore    jshintrc    travis yml    gruntfile js    package json contains a simple html file to demonstrate your plugin this is where the generated files are stored once grunt runs contains the files responsible for your plugin you can choose between javascript or coffeescript this file is for unifying the coding style for different editors and ides list of files that we don t want git to track list of rules used by jshint to detect errors and potential problems in javascript definitions for continous integration using travis contains all automated tasks using grunt specify all dependencies loaded via node js have you got in this repo and still not sure about using this boilerplate well extending jquery with plugins and methods is very powerful and can save you and your peers a lot of development time by abstracting your most clever functions into plugins note the jquery plugin registry is in read only mode new plugin releases will not be processed and and and and and and
14855579, ever been frustrated finding information on outdated one off blog posts and tutorials that has since become irrelevant how many times were you googling only to find your answer only on a  year old stackoverflow post we believe there s got to be a better way why not have the community work together to create useful and detailed documentation for every aspect of ios or any platform there s absolutely no reason that we should have to make do with outdated vague or un editable content anymore
938745, tl dr we ve replaced what yepnope used to do with a very minimal script to help you do what we think is best for your apps the authors of yepnope feel that the front end community now offers better software for loading scripts as well as conditionally loading scripts none of the apis for these new tools are quite as easy as yepnope but we assure you that it s probably worth your while we don t officially endorse any replacement however we strongly suggest you follow an approach using modules and then package up your application using require js webpack browserify or one of the many other excellent dependency managed build tools when it comes to loading things conditionally we suggest that you output a build for each combination of the things you re testing this might sound like it will generate a lot of files it might  but computers are pretty good at that then you can inline a script into your page that only loads asynchronously a single built script that is tuned to the features of that user all the performance win of conditional loading and none of the latency problems of loading  things at once we have replaced this repo with a script that will help you load the correct conditional build and will only be taking issues and pull requests for this new script it retains many of the original functions and features as the original yepnope however it no longer executes scripts in an order if you re looking for something that specifically does that you can use an old version of yepnope or another in order script loader like labjs for these reasons we re also not going to include yepnope in the next version of modernizr as modernizr load a script loader for your conditional builds javascript and and it will do the right thing with a js or css extension yepnope script js  modernimages modernizr webp modernizr apng css modernizr borderradius modernizr boxshadow consoleapis window console window console log and a request for script js yep cssconsoleapis nope modernimages would be made assuming that set of results it s up to you to serve the correct build file from that url you should statically build and and or cache this endpoint if you re running a custom build of modernizr version  and  the only own properties of the modernizr object are the tests all other properties are stored on the prototype because of this you can easily just pass yepnope your modernizr object and not have to worry about creating a test object javascript yepnope build js  modernizr function myapp init we also expose our underlying script and css injection functions as yepnope injectjs yepnope injectcss the callback does not wait for the css to actually be loaded the tests are a good place to look at the uses if you need the generated url from the tests to look a certain way feel free to override the yepnope urlformatter function javascript and and change it to only output passing tests as dashes on the file name yepnope urlformatter function url tests var parts url split var extension parts pop var filename parts join var passes if tests for var testname in tests if tests hasownproperty testname tests testname passes push testname if passes length return filename and and passes join and and extension return url then the url generated from the first example above would be script css consoleapis js git clone git github com slexaxton and yepnope js git cd yepnope js git checkout the branch you want npm install grunt test grunt serve your build will be in the dist and folder version  is a significant diversion from version  x we feel that the direction helps developers make the best decisions for performance rather than enabling poor uses changes in   and rewrote entire library relicensed to new bsd deprecated

cycle but surely playgrounds aren t possible in objective c you say in fact they can be much better than swift ones features faster than swift playgrounds a lot extra controls for tweaking values images auto animated values synchronizing dsl s buttons ide agnostic once you run it you can modify the code even from vim full ios simulator and access to all ios features so you can prototype production ready code nice dsl for rapid prototyping cocoapods support so you can add it to existing projects to experiment open source anyone can contribute to make them better and it s just a start and screenshots and playground png raw true first let s establish naming timeline is a place where you have snapshots and controls worksheet is a place where you can add views and controls and have

46366544, now when rnpm is a part of react native we re going to seal this repository and keep working on react native tooling inside the core that said i kindly ask you to file all new issues and prs in react native repo and cc us this repo and other rnpm plugins will be a available for a few more months in a read only mode with love alexey kureev and micha grabowski react native package manager built to ease your daily react native development inspired by cocoapods  fastlane and react native link it acts as your best friend and guides you through the native unknowns it aims to work with almost all packages available with no extra configuration required rnpm should always be run in projects that use version control to ensure any changes made can be easily reverted node   npm install rnpm g installing dependency if you want to install a dependency and link it in one run rnpm install name linking dependency if you already have some installed but not linked modules run rnpm link in the case you want to link only one dependency you can specify its name as an argument rnpm link name why tooling is important we all know this one of the biggest advantages of native ios development is xcode and its great tools unfortunately the process of adding native dependencies to react native projects is far from perfect and our aim is to make it fun again react native package manager provides you with soon multiple actions to help you with daily development including automatic app store releases over the air integration with apphub and react native playground shares but hey we are tired of tools and  and rc files so are we that s why we have spent great amount of work on getting configuration done right our packager automatically scans your source directory and dependencies you are working with this approach allows it to link all the things without supplying any extra configuration it detects android package names import paths gradle location and for ios it works with any code structure you have ever came up with and don t worry in case it fails you can always add rnpm object to your package json our npm in a name is not a mistake we embrace existing ecosystem and integrate with the present tooling for maximum developer experience automatically updates your project by linking all dependencies for android if present and for ios if present it s a great fit to your postinstall hook to always make sure you are linked you can supply optional name argument to link only one dependency e g npm install react native module save rnpm link react native module automatically installs the given package and links it to your project it s equivalent to running the previous example it s just instead of running two commands you can now just rnpm install react native module if you re authoring an awesome react native library with custom assets you probably need an additional step after linking copying assets to the application folder well that s not complicated just add rnpm section in your package json file rnpm assets fonts we ll copy your assets carefully with love for android heart for ios we will add files to resources group and update info plist so fonts are available for you to use straight away as of version    rnpm supports plugin system it allows you to write your own and use third party commands to make your rnpm sharpened for specific purposes in order to install rd party plugin simply run below from your project directory npm install rnpm plugin name save dev rnpm help you ll see installed plugin in the commands list command exported by installed plugin will be available straight away we use public interface to make your plugins auto pluggable and easy to use for end users every public interface consists of name  func description fields name name of the plugin after plugin installation it ll be used as a command name for instance a plugin with the following interface javascript module exports func require and src and link  description this action updates your project and links all native dependencies  name link packagename  can be used like via rnpm like this bash rnpm link func plugin itself this function will be used when you run a command above description command description if user runs rnpm help  this field will be displayed as a command description options an array of flags user can specify for your plugin to run when defined your exported func will receive an object of options as a rd argument for instance a plugin with the following options flags l list path  description list flag  parse val val split  map number  default   will receive the following object list  by default also in the case you want to expose multiple commands from the one plugin you may use an array syntax javascript module exports func require and src and link  description this action updates your project and links all native dependencies  name link packagename  func require and src and unlink  description this action updates your project and unlink specific dependency  in the case you need an additional input from the user you may make a command for this purpose commands works similar to the npm scripts depdendency s package json rnpm commands prelink and bin and requestgatoken  postlink and bin and linkingsucceeded in this scenario we re using custom prelink and postlink hooks for rnpm plugin link to tell rnpm that we want to run prelink script before and postlink after the linking process note commands may be async and require some user input using third party libraries inquirer for instance you don t need to worry about async queues we do it for you under the rnpm hood while making your own plugins for rnpm you may use any names for the commands but we strongly recommend you to use a convention we suggest to avoid collisions when and plugin name prelink pre and link on android you can specify a custom packageinstance to be used when linking your project the reason for that is often that your package constructor simply requires extra user provided config e g api token rnpm allows you to define an array of additional arguments to get from user during linking process that you can then reference in your packageinstance simply include the following in your package json rnpm params type input  name gatoken  message what s your ga token and update your packageinstance with the new variable rnpm android packageinstance new somelibname this gatoken starting from now on users will be presented an interactive form powered by inquirer each time they run rnpm link we re open for community ideas react native link is great but it only works for android now it also does not automatically add packages to your project nor support custom folder configuration we aim to solve these issues by analyzing folders and getting maximum informations available from them when running rnpm link you don t have to think about the package exported by developer or the import path to include in your java project yes in fact it has nothing to do with it what it does is just linking static libraries automatically to your xcodeproj in the normal way you have been doing that there are no more other changes sure you can try doing something like this in your package json scripts postinstall rnpm link make sure you have run npm install name save first to be as fast as possible rnpm link gets list of modules to link from package json s dependencies if you have them in devdependencies  they are going to be skipped this project follows semver there are several  x versions published to npm registry you should not install as they belong to the previous project that was using that name  years ago we welcome all contributors simply make an issue or send over a pull request we really

8883822, simple lightweight flat surface shader written in javascript for rendering lit triangles to a number of contexts currently there is support for webgl  canvas d and svg check out this demo demo to see it in action simply put fss uses the lambertian reflectance lambert model to calculate the color of a triangle based on an array of light sources within a scene a light is composed of a d position vector and  color objects defining its ambient diffuse emissions these color channels interact with the material of a mesh to calculate the color of a triangle a triangle is constructed from  vertices which each define the x y and z coordinates of a corner based on these  vertices  a forth d vector is automatically derived at the center of the triangle  this is known as its centroid centroid alongside the centroid  a fifth unit unit vector is automatically calculated which defines the surface normal normal the normal describes the direction that the triangle is facing geometry is simply a collection of triangles  nothing more a material is composed of  color objects which define the ambient diffuse properties of a surface a mesh is constructed from a geometry object and a material object all the triangles within the geometry are rendered using the properties of the material a scene sits at the very top of the stack it simply manages arrays of mesh light objects the renderer takes all the information in a scene and renders it to a context currently fss supports webgl  canvas d and svg for every triangle in a scene the following calculation is performed  a vector between the triangle s centroid and the light s position is calculated and normalised normalise this can be considered as a single ray travelling from the light to the center of the triangle  the angle beween this ray and the normal of the triangle is then calculated using the dot product dotproduct this angle is simply a number ranging from  to  when the ray and the normal are coincident this value is  and when they are perpendicular to one another this value is  this value goes into the negative range when the light is behind the triangle  firstly the diffuse color of the light is multiplied by the diffuse color of the material associated with the triangle this color is then multiplied by the coincidence angle described above for example if the diffuse color of the light is ffffff r  g  b  and the diffuse color of the material is ff r  g  b   the combined color would be ff r    g    b    if the coincidence angle was   the final color of the triangle would be  r      g     b      in much the same way as above the ambient color of the light is multipled by the ambient color of the material since ambient light is a uniform dissipation of scattered light it is not modified any further  the final color of the triangle is simply calculated by adding the diffuse ambient colors together simples note all objects exist within the fss namespace javascript and and  create a renderer for the context you would like to render to and and you can use either the webglrenderer canvasrenderer or svgrenderer var renderer new fss canvasrenderer and and  add the renderer s element to the dom var container document getelementbyid container container appendchild renderer element and and  create a scene var scene new fss scene and and  create some geometry a material pass them to a mesh constructor and add the mesh to the scene var geometry new fss plane     var material new fss material   ffffff var mesh new fss mesh geometry material scene add mesh and and  create and add a light to the scene var light new fss light ff  ff scene add light and and  finally render the scene renderer render scene install dependancies npm install uglify js    node build js please also checkout the case study on behance behance created by my dear friend tobias van schneider vanschneider  schneidertobias schneidertobias the architecture of this project was heavily influenced by three js three and the implementation of the vector calculations was taken from glmatrix glmatrix matthew wagerfield mwagerfield mwagerfield licensed under mit mit enjoy

50453050, this is starter template for writing android apps using clean architecture you can download it modify it and start building your apps on top of it most of the boilerplate code for writing your first view presenter and interactor is already written and you just need to implement your own logic i wrote a detailed guide on how to write apps using this pattern but this readme contains the summary this starter app supports api  and above this template uses regular java instead of rxjava and does not use dagger although i recommend dagger the reason for this is that i did not want to add more complexity as the architecture itself is probably complex enough to understand if you prefer rxjava and dagger then you can look at an awesome project called android cleanarchitecture that also inspired me to create this to see a sample app using clean architecture you can look here you will want to make a few minor changes when using this template rename the base package com kodelabs boilerplate to your preferred name how to modify the applicationid in your app and build gradle to the base package name you set in the above step modify package in manifest tag in androidmanifest xml if you have built and and or published apps using this boilerplate let me know and i will list it here a use case is just some isolated functionality of the app a use case may e g on user click or may not be started by a user for example a use case might be get all data from the database and display it on the ui when the app starts in this example our use case will be greet the user with a message that is stored in the database when the app starts this example can be tried out in the example branch this example will showcase how to write the following three packages needed to make the use case work the presentation layer the storage layer the domain layer the first two belong to the outer layers while the last one is the inner and core layer presentation package is responsible for everything related to showing things on the screen   it includes the whole mvp stack it means it also includes both the ui and presenter packages even though they belong to different layers in reality you could start in any layer of the architecture but i recommend you to start on your core business logic first you can write it test it and make sure it works without ever creating an activity so let s start by creating an interactor the interactor is where the main logic of the use case resides all interactors are run in the background thread so there shouldn t be any impact on ui performance let s create a new interactor with a warm name of welcominginteractor public interface welcominginteractor extends interactor interface callback void onmessageretrieved string message void onretrievalfailed string error the callback is responsible for talking to the ui on the main thread we put it into this interactor s interface so we don t have to name it a welcominginteractorcallback    to distinguish it from other callbacks now let s implement our logic of retrieving a message let s say we have some messagerepository that can give us our welcome message public interface messagerepository string getwelcomemessage now we should implement our interactor interface with our business logic it is important that the implementation extends the abstractinteractor which takes care of running it on the background thread public class welcominginteractorimpl extends abstractinteractor implements welcominginteractor private void notifyerror mmainthread post new runnable override public void run mcallback onretrievalfailed nothing to welcome you with   private void postmessage final string msg mmainthread post new runnable override public void run mcallback onmessageretrieved msg   override public void run and and retrieve the message final string message mmessagerepository getwelcomemessage and and check if we have failed to retrieve our message if message null and and message length  and and notify the failure on the main thread notifyerror return and and we have retrieved our message notify the ui on the main thread postmessage message this just attempts to retrieve the message and sends the message or the error to the ui to display it we notify the ui using our callback which is actually going to be our presenter that is the crux of our business logic everything else we need to do is framework dependent let s take a look which dependencies does this interactor have import com kodelabs boilerplate domain executor executor import com kodelabs boilerplate domain executor mainthread import com kodelabs boilerplate domain interactors welcominginteractor import com kodelabs boilerplate domain interactors base abstractinteractor import com kodelabs boilerplate domain repository messagerepository as you can see there is no mention of any android code that is the main benefit of this approach also we do not care about specifics of the ui or database we just call interface methods that someone somewhere in the outer layer will implement we can now run and test our interactor without running an emulator so let s write a simple junit test to make sure it works public void testwelcomemessagefound throws exception string msg welcome friend when mmessagerepository getwelcomemessage thenreturn msg welcominginteractorimpl interactor new welcominginteractorimpl mexecutor mmainthread mmockedcallback mmessagerepository interactor run mockito verify mmessagerepository getwelcomemessage mockito verifynomoreinteractions mmessagerepository mockito verify mmockedcallback onmessageretrieved msg again this interactor code has no idea that it will live inside an android app presentation layer is the outer layer in clean it consists of framework dependent code to display the ui to the user we will use mainactivity class to display the welcome message to the user when the app resumes let s start by writing the interface of our presenter and view the only thing our view needs to do is to display the welcome message public interface mainpresenter extends basepresenter interface view extends baseview void displaywelcomemessage string msg so how and where do we start the interactor when an app resumes everything that is not strictly view related should go into the presenter class this helps achieve separation of concerns and prevents the activity classes from getting bloated this includes all code working with interactors in our mainactivity class we override the onresume method override protected void onresume super onresume and and let s start welcome message retrieval when the app resumes mpresenter resume all presenter objects implement the resume method when they extend basepresenter we start the interactor inside the mainpresenter class in the resume method override public void resume mview showprogress and and initialize the interactor welcominginteractor interactor new welcominginteractorimpl mexecutor mmainthread this mmessagerepository and and run the interactor interactor execute the execute method will just execute the run method of the welcominginteractorimpl in a background thread the run method can be seen later in the writing a new interactor section you may notice that the interactor behaves similarly to the asynctask class you supply it with all that it needs to run and execute it you might ask why didn t we just use asynctask because that is android specific code and you would need an emulator to run it and to test it we provide several things to the interactor the threadexecutor instance which is responsible for executing interactors in a background thread i usually make it a singleton this class actually resides in the domain and does not need to be implemented in an outer layer the mainthreadimpl instance which is responsible for posting runnables on the main thread from the interactor main threads are accessible using framework dependent code and we implement it in an outer threading layer you may also notice we provide this to the interactor   mainpresenter is the callback object the interactor will use to notify the ui for events we provide an instance of the welcomemessagerepository which implements the messagerepository interface that our interactor uses the welcomemessagerepository is covered later in the writing the storage layer section regarding this  the mainpresenter of the mainactivity really does implement the callback interface public class mainpresenterimpl extends

2811234, siri proxy  siriproxy and ios   siri proxy is a proxy server for apple s siri assistant the idea is to allow for the creation of custom handlers for different actions this can allow developers to easily add functionality to siri notice about plugins  we recently changed the way plugins work very significantly that being the case your old plugins won t work the state of this project  find us on irc  we now have an irc channel check out the siriproxy channel on irc freenode net demo video  more demo videos and other plugins  set up instructions  new instructions for    note that the installation instructions have changed it s no longer necessary to install dnsmasq also siriproxy is available via rubygems for easy installation set up rvm and ruby    if you don t already have ruby    or at least    installed through rvm please do so in order to make sure you can follow the steps later experts can ignore this if you re unsure follow these directions carefully  install pre requisites veries by system for a fresh ubuntu   install these seem to be good sudo apt get install libxslt  libxslt dev xvfb build essential git core curl libyaml dev libssl dev  download and install rvm if you don t have it already download and install rvm update bashrc echo s home and rvm and scripts and rvm source home and rvm and scripts and rvm and bashrc echo export path home and rvm and bin path and bashrc activate changes and bashrc  install ruby    if you don t have it already rvm install     set rvm to use and default to    rvm use    default set up siriproxy  install siriproxy gem gem install siriproxy  create and siriproxy directory mkdir and siriproxy  generate certificates siriproxy gencerts  transfer certificate to your phone it will be located at and siriproxy and ca pem  email it to your phone  start siriproxy xxx xxx xxx xxx should be replaced with your server s ip address e g      nobody can be replaced with any un privileged user rvmsudo siriproxy server d xxx xxx xxx xxx u nobody  tell your phone to use your siriproxy server as its dns server under your wifi settings  test that the server is running by saying test siri proxy to your phone will this let me run siri on my none siri devices eg iphone  ipod touch iphone g microwave etc no please stop asking what is your opinion on hsiri public siriproxy servers and other siri ports how do i generate the certificate certificates can now be easily generated using siriproxy gencerts once you install the siriproxy gem see the instructions above how do i set up a dns server to forward guzzoni apple com traffic to my computer check out my video on this will this work outside my home network no it won t but as suggested by stbullard on youtube you could vpn into your home network from outside your house in order to make this work that would not require a jailbreak of course it also means all your traffic gets funneled through your home network the nice thing about adding an entry to your and etc and hosts file on a jailbroken phone is that it funnels only siri traffic through your home network and not all your traffic can you provide me with an iphone s udid no don t even ask i m getting a bunch of info guzzoni object sessionvalidationfailed messages what s wrong how do i remove the certificate from my iphone when i m done does this require a jailbreak no the only action you need to take on the phone is to install the root ca s public key using siri causes a whole bunch of the following messages followed by siriproxy crashing create server for iphone connection start conn siriproxy connection iphone xa signature  processedheaders false outputbuffer  inputbuffer  unzippedinput  unzippedoutput  unzipstream zlib inflate x  zipstream zlib deflate xdc  consumedace false name iphone  ssled false info plugin manager plugins loaded siriproxy plugin example xa manager siriproxy pluginmanager x plugins this is actually really common but can be tricky to fix the problem is that your siriproxy server is using your tainted dns server so what happens is this  your iphone connects to your server thinking it s guzzoni apple com  your server connects to itself  thinking that it s guzzoni apple com  your server thinks another iphone has connected and repeats step  this goes on forever or at least a second or two before the server up and dies the trick is that you need to make sure your server isn t connecting to itself when it requests a connection to guzzoni apple com this is actually the default behavior but many people accidentally mess things up by either  setting up their server to use itself as a dns server while using dnsmasq to taint the entry for guzzoni apple com  or  putting their server on a network where the dns server issued by dhcp is tainted to point to the wrong guzzoni apple com so the fix for this varies based on your setup but one possible fix for scenario  above on many nix machines is to edit and etc and resolve conf and change the nameserver entry to     one of google s public dns servers do this and then restart networking or just restart the computer and things should start working your network setup may be different this is the most complex part of setting up siriproxy getting dns set up correctly so once you have this working you are probably home free keep with it good luck and have fun running siriproxy as an unprivileged user  this used to be really hard now it s very easy just run rvmsudo siriproxy server u user and siriproxy will set it s userid to user s userid running siriproxy via upstart  note this section needs to be updated it was written before some of the newer features for siriproxy it should be much simpler now here s the upstart script i created for my home siriproxy server it respawns on a crash because siriproxy is delicate and likes to crash my server is running backtrack  a derivative of ubuntu   i believe and i use it as my wireless access point making it an obvious location for siriproxy description siriproxy server not sure if this is right but it seems to work start on started networking and filesystem stop on runlevel  exec start stop daemon start

44580889, this is a react renderer for generating markup on a nodejs server but unlike the built in reactdom rendertostring  this module renders to a stream streams make this library much faster at sending down the page s first byte than reactdom rendertostring  and user perceived performance gains can be significant one difficulty with reactdom rendertostring is that it is synchronous and it can become a performance bottleneck in server side rendering of react sites this is especially true of pages with larger html payloads because reactdom rendertostring s runtime tends to scale more or less linearly with the number of virtual dom nodes this leads to three problems  the server cannot send out any part of the response until the entire html is created which means that browsers can t start working on painting the page until the rendertostring call is finished with larger pages this can introduce a latency of hundreds of milliseconds  the server has to allocate memory for the entire html string  one call to reactdom rendertostring can dominate the cpu and starve out other requests this is particularly troublesome on servers that serve a mix of small and large pages this project attempts to fix these three problems by rendering asynchronously to a stream to learn more about ways to speed up your react server including using react dom stream  check out my talk from the reactjs sf meetup in january  first install react dom stream into your project npm install save react dom stream react dom react there are two public methods in this project rendertostring  rendertostaticmarkup  and they are intended as nearly drop in replacements for the corresponding methods in react dom and server to use either of the server side methods you need to require react dom stream and server this method renders element to a readable stream that is returned from the method in an express app it is used like this all examples are in es javascript import reactdomstream from react dom stream and server app get and  req res and and todo write out the html head and body tags stream pipe res end false stream on end  function and and todo write out the rest of the page including the closing body and html tags res end or if you d like a more terse but imo slightly harder to understand version javascript import reactdomstream from react dom stream and server app get and  req res and and todo write out the html head and body tags and and todo write out the rest of the page including the closing body and html tags res end pipe res end false if the piping syntax is not to your liking check out the section below on combining rendertostring and rendertostaticmarkup to render a full page this method renders element to a readable stream that is returned from the method like reactdom rendertostaticmarkup  it is only good for static pages where you don t intend to use react to render on the client side and in exchange it generates smaller sized markup than rendertostring in an express app it is used like this javascript import reactdomstream from react dom stream and server app get and  req res as of v  x rendertostaticmarkup can also accept streams as children in the react element tree see the next section for how this can be used to render a full page i wanted this pattern to be possible in react dom stream  so rendertostaticmarkup accepts readable streams as children in the react element tree the same way that it accepts strings as children in the tree this is useful for using rendertostaticmarkup for the page template and rendertostring for the dynamic html that you want to render with react on the client note that as with strings react dom stream automatically html encodes streams to protect against cross site scripting attacks so you need to use dangerouslysetinnerhtml to embed markup that would look something like this javascript import reactdomstream from react dom stream and server app get and  req res and and use rendertostaticmarkup to generate the entire html markup embedding the and and dynamic part under the renderdiv div reactdomstream rendertostaticmarkup head title my cool page and title and head body script and and custom javascript for reconnecting on the client side and script and body and html pipe res javascript import reactdomstream from react dom stream and server import raw from react raw html app get and  req res and and use rendertostaticmarkup to generate the entire html markup embedding the and and dynamic part under the renderdiv div reactdomstream rendertostaticmarkup head title my cool page and title and head body raw div id renderdiv and raw div script and and custom javascript for reconnecting on the client side and script and body and html pipe res note that rendertostring does not accept streams as children in the react element tree as there would be no way to reconnect to that markup on the client side if you want to embed a stream on the server side you want to use rendertostaticmarkup in v  x i ve added an experimental feature component caching this feature is based on the insight that a large amount of rendering time on a react server is wasted re rendering components with the exact same props and state they had in the previous page render if a component is a pure function of props state it should be possible to cache or memoize the render results and speed up rendering significantly to try this out in v  x you need to do two things first you must instantiate a cache object and pass it to either rendertostring or rendertostaticmarkup as the cache attribute on the optional options argument currently there is only one implementation of a cache lrurendercache  contained in the module react dom stream and lru render cache it takes in an options object that has one attribute max  which specifies the maximum number of characters in the cache it looks like this javascript import reactdomstream from react dom stream and server import lrurendercache from react dom stream and lru render cache and and create a cache that stores mb of text const mycache lrurendercache max    app get and  req res second you need to have your components opt in to caching by implementing a method called componentcachekey  which returns a single string representing a useable cache key for that component s current state the string returned by componentcachekey must include all inputs to rendering so that it can be used as a cache key for the render if componentcachekey leaves out some of the inputs to rendering it s possible that you will get cache collisions and you will serve up the wrong content to your users here s an example of a correct implementation javascript import react from react export default class cacheablecomponent extends react component render return span hello this props name and span componentcachekey and and the name prop completely specifies what the rendering will look like return this props name here is an incorrect implementation javascript import react from react export default class badcacheablecomponent extends react component render return span hello this props name it is new date and span and and incorrect componentcachekey and and the name prop does not completely specify the render and and so this implementation is wrong return this props name in this example the rendering depends on both this props name and date now  but componentcachekey only returns this props name this means that subsequent renderings of the component with the same name will get a cache hit and the time will therefore be out of date note that this caching feature is powerful but as of right now it is extremely experimental i would be very pleased if folks try it out in development and give me feedback but i strongly believe it should not be used in production until it has been tested more thoroughly server side caching on a component basis has real potential but mistakes in server side caching can be extremely costly as they are often liable to leak private information between users you have been warned also note that the apis of this feature are liable to change in the future i hope to add features to caching such as the ability to write a custom cache implementation comprehensive statistics of cache efficiency hit miss rate time spent looking up entries in the cache total time saved and spent by the cache etc a self tuning cache that can decide whether or not to cache a component based on that component class s previous hit rate and and or the expense of generating its cache keys feel free to file issues asking for features you would find interesting in previous versions of react dom stream  you needed to use a special render library to reconnect to server generated markup as of version    and later this is no longer the case you can now use the normal reactdom render method as you would when using reactdom to generate server side markup currently react dom stream offers a slight tradeoff for larger pages it significantly reduces time to first byte while for smaller pages react dom stream can actually be a net negative albeit a small one string construction in node is extremely fast and streams and asynchronicity add an overhead in my testing pages smaller than about kb have worse ttfb and ttlb using react dom stream these pages are not generally a performance bottleneck to begin with though and on my mid   ghz mbp the difference in render time between react dom and react dom stream for these small pages is usually less than a millisecond for larger pages the ttfb stays relatively constant as the page gets larger ttfb stays around ms on my laptop  while the ttlb tends to hover at or slightly below the time that react dom takes however even here there is a wrinkle because most of my testing has been done against localhost when i use real world network speeds and latencies react dom stream often beats react significantly in both ttfb and ttlb this is probably because react dom stream s faster time to first byte gets a headstart on filling up the network pipe one other operational challenge that react dom stream can help with is introducing asynchronicity which can allow requests for small pages to not get completely blocked by executing requests for large pages this project is of beta quality i don t know if it has been used in production yet and the api is still firming up it does however pass all of the automated tests that are currently run on react dom in the main react project plus one or two dozen more that i ve written this module is forked from facebook s react project all extra code and modifications are offered under the apache   license there were major breaking api changes in v  and v  to learn how to upgrade your client code please read changelog md and changelog md well this is awkward awesome you are the coolest to get a working build running and learn a little about how the project is set up please read contributing md contributing md if you d like to send prs to either repo please feel free i ll require a cla before pulling code to keep rights clean but we can figure that out when we get

7400568, i greatly appreciate any contributions that you may have for the site feel free to fork the project and work on any of the reported issues or let me know about any improvements you think would be beneficial when sending pull requests please keep them focused on a single issue i would rather deal with a dozen pull requests for a dozen issues with one change each over one pull request fixing a dozen issues also i appreciate tests to be included with feature development but for minor changes i will probably not put up much of a fuss if they re missing while it is not necessary i recommend using rvm for managing your ruby environment a project rvmrc file is provided in the repo which will switch to ruby    p and use a gemset called regexper to avoid polluting your global gems once your environment is ready either by using rvm or setup manually  you can install necessary requirements using bundler bundle install foreman start it is also recommended to run guard while developing to ensure tests continue passing bundle exec guard see license md file for licensing details
325827, msysgit brings a few components that are required to build git bash a unix type command line shell quite a few components of git itself are still shell scripts therefore bash is required to execute git commands see the output of cd and git git ls files sh for a full list gnu make perl still required for a couple of git components see the output of cd and git git ls files perl  most notably git svn tcl and tk a scripting language making it easy to implement cross platform graphical user interfaces we need this for gitk and git gui many more libraries some unix programs required by the shell scripts in git however at least the bash needs a posix layer most notably due to the absence of the fork call on windows therefore msys the minimal system is thrown in offering the minimal system necessary to offer bash and perl functionality on windows consequently msys ships with a posix layer based on an old version of cygwin that is only used by the bash and perl but not by anything compiled within that environment

52410553, react project state of the art web development  a dependency not a boilerplate to make your react project a delight to this is brand new not ready for production unless you are ready and willing to contribute to the project basically just building something we want here if it interests you please help also it has no tests also it s kind of awesome i m running node v   and npm v   as i tinker there s no plan to support older versions at the moment please see contributing md and contributing md the quickest way to get started is to use create react project npm install g create react project create react project the best app ever cd the best app ever npm install npm start go edit a file notice the app reloads you can enable hot module replacement by adding autoreload hot to env nodeenv production npm start minified gzipped long term hashed assets and server pre rendering and you can use this as a dependency of an existing app for now the result of create react project is your best documentation on how to do that modern javascript with babel babel polyfills vendor and app initial bundles auto reload refresh entire page none let you refresh when you re ready optimized production build test runner please see contributing md and contributing md and help out cut the crap and start building an app right away wrap up the stuff that is good for all apps keep the app in charge config lives in the app defaults provided by the framework are imported into the app the app is not imported into the framework escape hatches are important upgrading should be simple benefits should come w and o changing app code usually as soon as i ship a real app with this i ll ship   after running react project init your package json will have some new tasks starts the server it s smart enough to know which nodeenv you re in if nodeenv production you ll get the full production build if you re shipping to heroku for instance deploying is just git push heroku master it ll create a production build up there runs any files named modules and and test js with karma and mocha implementation needs work desired api is app doesn t need tests webpack js context junk app only has a karma config and a webpack tests config karma config configurable on package json react project  like karma karma conf js blueprint default is export karmaconfig from react project and test webpack test config one more export from webpack config js both configs should be babel d this way people can mess w and the default configs both webpack and karma or take full control react project will use environment variables to know how to build for production v development for local development you can edit the env file to change environment variables in production you ll want to set them on the box nodeenv production publicpath and or a cdn you push your assets to serverrendering on when npm start is called on a machine with those environment variables your app will be optimized with things like gzip compression devhost localhost devport  autoreload refresh autoreload hot autoreload none import lazy serverroute from react project convenience method to simplify lazy route configuration with bundle loader bundle loader import lazy from react project and and bundle loader returns a function here that will load dashboard and and lazily it won t be in the initial bundle import loaddashboard from bundle lazy and dashboard and and now wrap that load function with lazy and you re done you ve got and and super simple code splitting the dashboard code won t be downloaded and and until the user visits this route and and just fyi lazy doesn t do anything other than wrap up the callback and and signatures of getcomponent and the bundle loader without lazy you and and would be doing this route getcomponent location cb loaddashboard dashboard cb dashboard default defines a route to only be available on the server add handlers functions to the different http methods note you have to restart the server after making changes to server routes but only until somebody implements hmr for the server you can nest routes to get path nesting but only the final matched route s handler is called maybe we could do something cool later with the handlers import serverroute from react project and server listevents createevent getevent updateevent deleteevent from and events export default route path and api serverroute path events get listevents post createevent serverroute path id get getevent patch updateevent delete deleteevent and serverroute and route req an express request object res an express resonponse object params the url parameters location the matched location route the matched server route import createserver from react project and server createserver req res cb cb null renderdocument renderapp routes start creates and returns a new express express server with a new start method app supplied function to render the top level document callback with a document document component you ll probably want to just tweak the document component supplied by the blueprint callback err reactelement initialstate reactelement is the react element to be rendered initialstate is initial state from the server for data re hydration on the client app supplied function to render the application content should call routercontext at the end of the render tree callback err reactelement if you call back with an error object with a status key the server will respond with that status callback status  the app s routes it s not intended that you use this directly task should be done with npm scripts initializes the app copies over a blueprint app updates package json with tasks etc builds the assets called from npm start  not normally called directly

31307723, this repository is the result of a tech talk that i gave at carnegie mellon university on february   its central motivation is this students who have been instructed or told to use vim to complete programming assignments while ssh ed are missing out on the vast power that lies within vim there are two fronts to having an amazing vim experience  knowing how to manipulate text using vim s built in keyboard shortcuts  having plugins that make vim behave like users would expect from a modern text editor in my experience as a ta and fellow student learning the former requires the latter and vice versa leading to a vicious cycle of vim peril with this in mind this repository aims to cure the latter so that the vicious cycle can this repository contains a sample vimrc that walks you through the changes at each step so that you can gain an understanding of what s going on rather than just copying someone s vimrc each commit in this repository corresponds to a step from the actual workshop use the  list of all commits master  to browse the steps you ll see a sometimes lengthy explanation of what happened and then the diff erence of exactly what changed from step to step this is what you should do read the commit message and github comments copy the changes it s that simple depending on how fast you read and how in depth you want to go you could easily have a fully configured vim setup in about an hour once you ve done this the hard part is learning to use what you just installed i went back through and added some usage information and links to references on the github comments so be sure to check them out even though you can install this file outright you should really look through the steps for more information about what s going on note every time you add a new plugin line you ll have to run vim and plugininstall and qall create vimrc file step  add some general settings step  enable the mouse step  set up vundle boilerplate step  make vim look good step  plugins nerdtree and nerdtree tabs step  plugin syntastic step  plugins vim easytags and tagbar step  plugin ctrlp step  plugin a vim step  plugins vim gitgutter and vim fugitive step  plugin delimitmate step  plugin vim superman step  plugin vim tmux navigator step  syntax plugins step  add all the extra plugins that i use step  as you re following along these steps if you want to check whether what you see matches up with what my setup looks like after a given step jump over to this update    i ve taken a pass through to update some of the more outdated commits unfortunately this means some links have become broken you can still find links to these steps by going to the branch original if you find outdated links anywhere here please let me know if you just want to use this file as your vimrc no questions asked  move your and vimrc file and and vim folder somewhere else for now  download the file vimrc vim and vimrc vim and rename it to and vimrc  run vim and plugininstall and qall  profit find more plugins learn how to actually use vim vimtutor in particular vim as language  customize my vimrc look at these examples see the first  and last  links write my own vim plugin in order to teach people plugins i had to sacrifice teaching people how to tap into the power of editing in vim which comes from using the keyboard over the mouse  please take a little time to learn how to actually use vim when i say fully configured i mean actually usable it can be argued that vim is never fully configured everyone s preferences are different and circumstances change configuring your text editor is really a continuous

12799336, bucky is a client and server for sending performance data from the client into statsd and graphite opentsdb or any other stats aggregator of your choice it can automatically measure how long your pages take to load how long ajax requests take and how long various functions take to run most importantly it s taking the measurements on actual page loads so the data has the potential to be much more valuable than in vitro measurements if you already use statsd or opentsdb you can get started in just a few minutes if you re not what gets measured gets managed you can play with bucky just using the client but if you d like to start collecting data see the that config will automatically log the performance of your page and all the requests you make to a server running at and bucky it will automatically decide the right key name based on the url of the page if you d like you can also specify it manually the bucky object will be available globally but there is nothing you need to call for basic usage bucky can also be loaded with amd or browserify see the methods below npm install bucky coffeescript bucky require bucky before sending any data call setoptions if you re not using the data attribute based configuration javascript bucky setoptions some options you might be interested in approot the bucky server has a very liberal cors config so we should be able to connect to it even if it s on a different domain but hosting it on the same domain and port will save you some preflight requests active should bucky actually send data use this to disable bucky during local dev for example sample what fraction of clients should actually send data use to subsample your clients if you have too much data coming in full list of options modern browsers log a bunch of page performance data bucky includes a method for writing all of this in one go it won t do anything on browsers which don t support the performance timing api call it whenever it will bind an event if the data isn t ready yet coffeescript bucky sendpageperformance where the data should go setting data bucky page triggers this automatically the two most relevant stats provided are responseend which is the amount of time it took for the original page to be loaded and dominteractive which is the amount of time before the page has finished loaded and can be interacted with by the user as a reminder this data is browser specific so it will likely skew lower than what users on old browsers see if you re using backbone it might be a good idea to send your data based on route coffeescript backbone history on route  router route will only send on the initial page load bucky sendpageperformance some location page route the data collected will look something like this javascript pages contactdetail timing connectend   and ms pages contactdetail timing connectstart   and ms pages contactdetail timing domcomplete   and ms pages contactdetail timing domcontentloadedeventend   and ms

on the url to try and create a graphite key from it enable it as early in your app s load as is possible coffeescript bucky requests monitor my project requests setting data bucky requests calls this automatically the data collected will look something like this for a get request to api hubapi com and automation and v and workflows javascript contacts web prod requests api hubapi automation v

get sending   and ms contacts web prod requests api hubapi automation v workflows get waiting   and ms you can build a client which will prefix all of your datapoints by calling bucky as a function coffeescript mybucky bucky awesome app view mybucky send data point   you can repeatedly call clients to add more prefixes coffeescript contactsbucky bucky contacts cwbucky contactsbucky web cwbucky send x   data goes in contacts web x by default send sends absolute values this is rarely what you want when working from the client incrementing a counter is usually more helpful coffeescript bucky count my awesome thing bucky count number of chips eaten   you can manually send ms durations using timer send coffeescript bucky timer send timed thing   bucky includes a method to time async functions coffeescript bucky timer time my awesome function  done asyncthingy done you can also manually start and stop your timer coffeescript bucky timer start my awesome function asyncthingy bucky timer stop my awesome function you can time synchronous functions as well coffeescript bucky timer timesync my awesome function  math sqrt  the time and timesync functions also accept a context and arguments to pass to the called function coffeescript bucky timer timesync my render function  render  arg arg you can wrap existing functions using wrap coffeescript func bucky timer wrap func time  func it also supports a special syntax for methods coffeescript class someclass render bucky timer wrap render normal render stuff note that this wrapping does not play nice with coffeescript super calls bucky also includes a function for measuring the time since the navigationstart event was fired the beginning of the request coffeescript bucky timer mark my thing happened it acts like a timer where the start is always navigation start the stopwatch method allows you to begin a timer which can be stopped multiple times coffeescript watch bucky stopwatch some prefix if you want you can then call watch mark key to send the time since the stopwatch started or watch split key to send the time since the last split if you want to send absolute values rare from the client  you can use send directly the one use we ve had for this is sending and new date from every client to get an idea of how skewed their clocks are coffeescript bucky send my awesome datapoint    you can find your stats in the stats and stats timing folders in graphite or as written in opentsdb bucky will send your data in bulk from the client either five seconds after the last datapoint is added or thirty seconds after the last send whichever comes first if you log multiple datapoints within this send frequency the points will be averaged and the appropriate frequency information will be sent to statsd with the exception of counters they are incremented this means that the max and min numbers you get from statsd actually represent the max and min   second bucket note that this is per client not for the entire bucky process it s generally only important on the server where you might be pushing out many points with the same key the bucky object provides a couple extra properties you can access bucky history the history of all datapoints ever sent bucky active is bucky sending data this can change if you change the active or sample settings bucky flush send the bucky queue immediately bucky timer now a clock based on the most precise time available not guarenteed to be from the epoch request monitor attempts to automatically transform your urls into keys it does a bunch of transformations with the goal of removing anything which will vary per request so you end up with stats per endpoint these tranformations include stripping guids ids shas mds stripping email addresses stripping domains if you find these tranformations too invasive or not invasive enough you can modify them javascript and and you can diable tranforms with disable bucky requests transforms disable guid and and you can enable transforms with enable bucky requests tranforms enable guid and and enable can also be used to add a new tranform bucky requests transforms enable my ids  and       and g and and the third argument defines what the match is replaced with rather than just eliminating it bucky requests transforms enable campaign  and campaigns and w  and ig and campaigns and and you can also just provide a function which takes in the url and returns it modified bucky request transforms enable soup  function url return url split reverse join enabled tests will be added to the beginning of the enabled list meaning they will be executed before any other tranform edit the bucky requests tranforms enabled array if you need more specific control the order of the transforms is very important if you for example were to run the id transform before the guid one the guid transform wouldn t match any guid which began with a number as the number would have already been stripped out making the guid the wrong length when you first enable request monitoring it s a good idea to keep an eye on the bucky logs to get an idea of what sort of data points are being created this project pushes data to the bucky server

your javascript const choreographer require choreographer js brew up some instant scroll animations this one would scale a box s opacity from  to  mirroring your scroll location from the top to  full example examples and one html let choreographer new choreographer animations range    selector box  type scale  style opacity  from  to  window addeventlistener scroll  choreographer runanimationsat window pageyoffset what about animations based on mouse movement this would make box move px down if your mouse was in the left half of the browser window let choreographer new choreographer animations range  window innerwidth and   selector box  type change  style transform translatey  to  unit px document body addeventlistener mousemove  e choreographer runanimationsat e clientx you can simply install the package via npm npm install save choreographer js or if you re keeping things super simple just include this file dist and choreographer min js as a script like so cool now you can create an instance of choreographer like this and run the animations based on whatever measurement floats your boat ex scroll position mouse position timestamp whatever let choreographer new choreographer config choreographer runanimationsat position more often than not you ll probably want to wrap that runanimationsat function in another like an event handler for instance window addeventlistener scroll  and and then use the scroll position pageyoffset to base the animations off of choreographer runanimationsat window pageyoffset the easiest way to understand how this all works is to check out the examples examples more detailed documentation below class and the home base for everything construction new choreographer choreographerconfig choreographerconfig public

animationfunction selector and string or nodelist or dom element a valid dom element list of elements or selector string ex classname or box thing data attr true selectors and array an array of selector strings as described above note only one of the below selector or selectors is necessary if they both exist selectors will be used style and string a valid css style property or the string class to toggle a classname instead note if you are using transform  follow it with a colon and the property name ex transform scalex from and number the minimum value to set to the style property

be a string whatever the valid type for the relevant style property is related references animationfunction animationfunction function and a function that takes animationdata animationdata and does something with it there are two built in animation functions available called scale and change scale maps a progressively calculated value to the node s style property based on location change adds or

5254650, happy logging  i m a lumberjack and i m ok i sleep when idle then i ship logs all day i parse your logs i eat the jvm agent for lunch  this project was recently renamed from lumberjack to logstash forwarder to make its intended use clear the lumberjack name now remains as the network protocol and logstash forwarder is the name of the program it s still the same lovely log forwarding program you love if you have questions and cannot find answers please join the logstash irc channel on freenode irc or ask on the logstash users googlegroups com mailing a tool to collect logs locally in preparation for processing elsewhere perceived problems some users view logstash releases as large or have a generalized fear of java actual problems logstash for right now runs with a footprint that is not friendly to underprovisioned systems such as ec micro instances on other systems it is fine this project will exist until that is resolved few log transport mechanisms provide security low latency and reliability the lumberjack protocol used by this project exists to provide a network protocol for transmission that is secure low latency low resource usage and reliable logstash forwarder is configured with a json file you specify with the config flag logstash forwarder config yourstuff json here s a sample with comments in line to describe the settings comments are invalid in json but logstash forwarder will strip them out for you if they re the only thing on the line the network section covers network configuration network a list of downstream servers listening for our messages logstash forwarder will pick one at random and only switch if the selected one appears to be dead or unresponsive servers localhost   the path to your client ssl certificate optional ssl certificate and logstash forwarder crt  the path to your client ssl key optional ssl key and logstash forwarder key  the path to your trusted ssl ca file this is used to authenticate your downstream server ssl ca and logstash forwarder crt  network timeout in seconds this is most important for logstash forwarder determining whether to stop waiting for an acknowledgement from the downstream server if an timeout is reached logstash forwarder will assume the connection or server is bad and will connect to a server chosen at random from the servers list timeout  the list of files configurations files an array of hashes each hash tells what paths to watch and what fields to annotate on events from those paths  paths single paths are fine and var and log and messages  globs are fine too they will be periodically evaluated to see if any new files match the wildcard and var and log and log  a dictionary of fields to annotate on each event fields type syslog  a path of means stdin paths  fields type stdin  paths and var and log and apache and httpd log  fields type apache  any part of config can use environment variables as var or var they will be evaluated before processing json allowing to pass any structure you can also read an entire directory of json configs by specifying a directory instead of a file with the config option this program will reject ssl and tls certificates which have a subject which does not match the servers value for any given connection for example if you have servers foobar  then the foobar server must use a certificate with subject or subject alternative that includes cn foobar wildcards are supported also for things like cn example com if you use an ip address such as servers       your ssl certificate must use an ip san with value     if you do not the tls handshake will fail and the lumberjack connection will close due to trust problems creating a correct ssl and tls infrastructure is outside the scope of this document as a very poor example largely due unpredictability in your system s defaults for openssl  you can try the following command as an example for creating a self signed certificate and key pair for use with a server named logstash example com openssl req x batch nodes newkey rsa  keyout lumberjack key out lumberjack crt subj and cn logstash example com the above example will create an ssl cert for the host logstash example com you cannot use and cn     to create an ssl certificate for an ip address in order to do a certificate with an ip address you must create a certificate with an ip subject alternative or often called ip san creating a certificate with an ip san is difficult and annoying so i highly recommend you use hostnames only if you have no dns available to you it is still often easier to set hostnames in and etc and hosts than it is to create a certificate with an ip san logstash forwarder needs the crt file and logstash will need both key and crt files again creating a correct ssl and tls certificate authority or generally doing certificate management is outside the scope of this document if you see an error like this x cannot validate certificate for     because it doesn t contain any ip sans it means you are telling logstash forwarder to connect to a host by ip address and therefore you must include an ip san in your certificate generating an ssl certificate with an ip san is quite annoying so i highly recommend you use dns names and set the cn in your cert to your dns name minimize resource usage where possible cpu memory network secure transmission of logs configurable event data easy to deploy with minimal moving parts simple inputs only follows files and respects rename and truncation conditions accepts stdin  useful for things like varnishlog and logstash forwarder  compile logstash forwarder note do not use gccgo for this project if you don t know what that means you re probably ok to ignore this git clone git and and github com and elasticsearch and logstash forwarder git cd logstash forwarder go build o logstash forwarder gccgo note using gccgo is not recommended because it produces a binary with a runtime dependency on libgo with the normal go compiler this dependency doesn t exist and as a result makes it easier to deploy you can check if you are using gccgo by running go version and if it outputs something like go version xgcc  you re probably not using gccgo and i recommend you don t you can also check the resulting binary by doing ldd and logstash forwarder and seeing if libgo appears in the output if it appears then you are using gccgo and i recommend you don t you can make native packages of logstash forwarder to do this a recent version of ruby is required at least version    or newer if you are using your os distribution s version of ruby especially on red hat or debian derived systems ubuntu centos etc  you will need to install ruby and whatever the ruby development package is called for your system on red hat systems you probably want yum install ruby devel on debian systems you probably want apt get install ruby dev prerequisite steps to prepare ruby to build your packages are gem install bundler bundle install the bundle install will install any ruby library dependencies that are used in building packages now build an rpm make rpm make deb if you don t use rpm or deb make targets as above you can skip this section packages install to and opt and logstash forwarder there are no run time dependencies generally logstash forwarder config logstash forwarder conf see logstash forwarder help for all the flags the config option is required and logstash forwrder will not run without it the config file is documented further up in this file and also note that logstash forwarder runs quietly when all is a ok if you want informational feedback use the verbose flag to enable log emits to stdout fatal errors are always sent to stderr regardless of the quiet command line option and process exits with a non zero status you ll need an ssl ca to verify the server host with you can specify custom fields for each set of paths in the config file any number of these may be specified i use them to set fields like type and other custom attributes relevant to each log logstash supports all certificates including self signed certificates to generate a certificate you can run the following command openssl req x batch nodes newkey rsa  keyout logstash forwarder key out logstash forwarder crt days  this will generate a key at logstash forwarder key and the  year valid certificate at logstash forwarder crt both the server that is running logstash forwarder as well as the logstash instances receiving logs will require these files on disk to verify the authenticity of messages recommended file locations certificates and etc and pki and tls and certs and logstash forwarder and keys and etc and pki and tls and private and logstash forwarder and input lumberjack the port to listen on port  the paths to your ssl cert and key sslcertificate path and to and ssl crt sslkey path and to and ssl key set this to whatever you want type somelogs below is valid as of  and  and  sets small resource limits memory open files on start up based on the number of files being watched cpu sleeps when there is nothing to do network and cpu sleeps if there is a network failure network uses zlib for compression uses openssl to verify the server certificates so you know who you are sending to uses openssl to transport logs the protocol supports sending a string string map see license file

61826602, source file stocks csv last updated on    note that this stock market simulation assumes a portfolio that is invested in  us stocks while a lot of the results show that  stocks can generate an impressive return this is not an ideal portfolio a portfolio should be diversified with a good mix of us stocks international stocks and bonds this diversification helps to hedge against market swings and will help the investor to optimize returns on their investment with lower risk than this visual demonstrates in addition to this this curve only looks at one lump sum of initial investing a typical investor will not have the capital to employ a single lump sum as a basis for a long term investment and will instead rely on dollar cost averaging  where cash is deposited across multiple years which helps to smooth out the curve as well warren buffet  it strikes me that if you did nothing else you never sell that is if you can grit your teeth through and just disregard short term declines in the market or even long term declines in the market you will come out well i mean you just stick all your money in stocks and go home and don t look at your portfolio you ll do far better than if you try to trade it alan greenspan a lot of people on and r and personalfinance usually green to the wonders of long term investing often question the security of the buy and hold strategy or would rather try to time the market instead this viz project is an attempt to do three things  objectively explore past returns so that all facets of long term investing past and present are explored  show that the invest early and invest often adage holds weight and by how much  observe what happens when a buy and hold strategy is implemented and how well that performs final plot final plot with average markings the plots above were generated based on past returns in the s p so at year  we take every point on the s p curve look at every point on the s p that s one year ahead add in dividends and subtract inflation and record all points as a relative gain or loss for year  then we do the same thing for year  then year  and so on ad nauseum the program took a couple hours to finish crunching all the numbers in short for the plots above if you invest for x years you have a distribution of y possible returns based on previous history i can already hear the keyboards being tapped for the comments section wait zoni this is over the span of  years nobody is ever going to live to invest for that long i know so let s take a look at a more realistic span of investing let s say you start investing at the age of  and then retire at age  which gives you  years of investing so after a quick subset stocksyear  here s what that snapshot will look like wait a minute zoom in what s going on with those data points that are losing money over x years here s the list of years you can invest and still be down take note that some of these years cover the same eras down after  years   chance historically                        down after  years   chance historically           down after  years   chance historically  down after  years  chance historically none code unique subset stocksmultip  year  inv year but that doesn t consider all the years that were average or even the years that were extremely profitable for investors here s the same plot above except with a  to  scale for better perspective what about dollar cost averaging dca instead of lump sum investing lsi this one is going to be a little more difficult i ve included the original code and it s open source so if you want to play with the numbers you can try to do this yourself however there are a couple points i d like to keep in mind there s inflation data in there but at some point you re going to have to account for that if you re using dollars as a scale how does one compare investing a dollar in  vs  dca will probably cause some scaling issues you ll need to accurately tune your algorithm to reflect an equivalent investment under the lsi algorithm i provide my prediction is that dca will thin out the plot and bring a lot more values closer to the average this makes investing a bit safer but at the cost of slower gains this portfolio is  stocks what about bonds international stocks how about a three fund portfolio one day i hope to simulate a three fund portfolio what if the market crashes right before retirement and the world ends up broke and the dollar crashes okay a few notes here  you can what if until the cows come home but you should also have what if scenarios for the possibility of your hypothesis being wrong real risk is not based off of possibilities  it s based off of probability multiplied by the severity of the event  no you re not absolutely sure it s going to happen stop drinking the kool aid  nobody is going to recommend a portfolio of  us stocks right before retirement that portfolio is going to be mostly bonds at that point  sky is falling headlines are big money makers for disreputable journalists and often enough there is no disincentive for these writers to be incorrect this viz actually started off as an animation below is the original plot for the animation i ll step through a few freeze frames of the plot above the code for these plots is shared in the altplots folder

33621458, build status travis image travis url box has migrated using react  webpack  and the latest version of ecmascript for our frontend projects as of  we no longer support changes pull requests or upgrades to this package we appreciate all of the user contributions that you have given us over the past few years enforcing loose coupling between components making dependencies explicit providing extension points to allow for unforeseen requirements abstracting away common pain points encouraging progressive enhancement t is different from most javascript frameworks it s meant to be a small piece of an overall architecture that allows you to build scalable client side code t is made to be unopinionated while prescribing how some problems might be solved our goal here is not to create a single framework that can do everything for you but rather to provide some structure to your client side code that allows you to make good choices then you can add in other libraries and frameworks to suit your needs t allows you to define functionality using just three component types  services are utility libraries that provide additional capabilities to your application you can think of services as tools in a toolbox that you use to build an application they intended to be reusable pieces of code such as cookie parsing ajax communication string utilities and so on  modules represent a particular dom element on a page and manage the interaction inside of that element it s a module s job to respond to user interaction within its boundaries your application is made up of a series of modules modules may not interact directly with other modules but may do so indirectly  behaviors are mixins for modules and are used primarily to allow shared declarative event handling for modules without duplicating code if for instance you use a particular attribute to indicate a link should use ajax navigation instead of full page navigation you can share that functionality amongst multiple modules we ve found that by using a combination of these three component types we re able to create compelling progressively enhanced user experiences the last published release you may also use bower to install tjs bower install tjs your t front end is made up of modules so the first step is to indicate which modules are responsible for which parts of the page you can do that by using the data module attribute and specifying the module id such as h box and h button data type welcome btn show welcome and button this example specifies the module header should manage this particular part of the page the module header is then defined as box application addmodule header  function context return onclick function event element elementtype if elementtype welcome btn alert welcome t user else alert you clicked outside the button   this is a very simple module that has an onclick handler t automatically wires up specified event handlers so you don t have to worry about using event delegation or removing event handlers when they are no longer needed the onclick handler receives a dom normalized event object that can be used to get event details when the button is clicked a message is displayed additionally clicking anywhere inside the module will display a different message event handlers are tied to the entire module area so there s no need to attach multiple handlers of the same type the last step is to initialize the t application box application init this call starts all modules on the page be sure to include both the t library and your module code before calling init we recommend calling init as soon as possible after your javascript is loaded whether you do that onload  earlier or later is completely up to you t is tested and known to work in the following browsers internet explorer  and higher firefox latest version chrome latest version safari latest version with the exception of internet explorer t will continue to support the current and previous one version of all major browsers the main purpose of sharing t is to continue its development making it faster more efficient and easier to use config configuration files for the project dist browser bundles this directory is updated automatically with each release lib the source code as individual files tests the test code in order to get started contributing to t you ll need to be familiar and have installed following the instructions in the contributor guidelines contributing md to setup a local copy of the t repository once you clone the t git repository run the following inside the tjs directory this sets up all the dependencies that the t build system needs to function note you ll need to do this periodically when pulling the latest code from our repository as dependencies might change if you find unexpected errors be sure to run npm i again to ensure your dependencies are up to date after that you can run all tests by running npm test this will start by linting the code and then running all unit tests the following build commands are available  npm test runs all linting and uni tests  npm run lint runs all linting  npm run dist creates the browser bundles and places them in and dist we provide a custom version of t built with jquery that is compatible with older browsers such as ie need to contact us directly email tjs box com mailto tjs box

5089764, hlearn is also a research project the research goal is to discover the best possible interface for machine learning this involves two competing demands the library should be as fast as low level libraries written in c and c and and and fortran and assembly but it should be as flexible as libraries written in high level languages like python and r and matlab but hlearn is more ambitious in particular hlearn s goal is to be faster than the low level languages and more flexible than the high level languages to achieve this goal hlearn uses a very different interface than standard learning libraries the h in hlearn stands for three separate concepts that are fundamental to hlearn s design machine learning is about estimating functions from data so it makes sense that a functional programming language would be well suited for machine learning but functional programming languages are not widely used in machine learning because they traditionally lack strong support for the fast numerical computations required for learning algorithms the two libraries are being developed in tandem with each other and hlearn exploits the algebraic structures inherrent in learning systems the following table gives a brief overview of what these structures give us and structure and what we get and and and and and monoid and parallel batch training and and monoid and online training and and monoid and fast cross validation and and abelian group and untraining of data points and and abelian group and more fast cross validation and and r module and weighted data points and and vector space and fractionally weighted data points and and functor and fast simple preprocessing of data and and monad and fast complex preprocessing of data and one of the most difficult tasks of developing a new learning algorithm is debugging the optimization procedure there has previously been essentially no work on making this debugging process easier and the history monad tries to solve this problem it lets you thread debugging information throughout the optimization code without modifying the original code furthermore there is no runtime overhead associated with this technique the downside of hlearn s ambition is that it currently does not implement many of the popular machine learning techniques due to the rapid pace of development hlearn s documentation is sparse the haddock documentation embedded within the code is decent but unfortunately hackage is unable to compile the haddocks because it uses an older version of ghc hlearn has several academic papers unfortunately they are mostly out of date with the latest version of hlearn they might help you understand some of the main concepts in hlearn but the code they use won t work at all i d love to have you contribute and i d be happy to help you get started

38778589, android download manager  android and java download manager library help you to download files in parallel mechanism in some chunks this library is a download manager android and java library which developers can use in their apps and allow you to download files in parallel mechanism in some chunks and notify developers about tasks status any download file process is a task each download task cross  stats in its lifetime  downloading  paused  download finished applications states docs and images and states jpg in the first stage you need to include these permissions in your androidmanifest xml file after that import com golshadi downloadmanager package in your packages folder so now everything is ready to start let s get started  one of the important benefits of this lib is that you don t need to initialize object completely before getting any reports downloadmanagerpro dm new downloadmanagerpro context to get report about tasks you can use these methods that will be introduced later on this doc public reportstructure singledownloadstatus int token public list reportstructure downloadtasksinsamestate int state public list reportstructure lastcompleteddownloads public boolean unnotifiedchecked public boolean delete int token boolean deletetaskfile attention in this documentation dm stands for downloadmanagerpro object initialize downloadmanagerpro  in order to download with this lib you need to set its basic configurations and give him a listener to poke you about tasks status void downloadmanagerpro init string savefilepath int maxchunk downloadmanagerlistener class string savefilepath folder address that you want to save your completed download task in it int maxchunk number of maximum chunks any task is divided into some chunks and download them in parallel it s better not to define more than  chunks but if you do it s set to  automatically downloadmanagerlistener listenerclass in this package an interface created to report developer download tasks status this interface includes some abstract methods that will be introduced later public class myactivity extends activity implements downloadmanagerlistener public void methodname  and and you can only pass this for context but here i want to show clearly downloadmanagerpro dm new downloadmanagerpro this getapplicationcontext dm init downloadmanager and   this   there are three ways to define your download task so you can define it any way you want for example if you didn t set maximum chunks number or sd card folder address it uses your initialized values these methods return you a task id that you can call to start or pause that task using this token int downloadmanagerpro addtask string savename string url int chunk string sdcardfolderaddress boolean overwrite boolean priority int downloadmanagerpro addtask string savename string url string sdcardfolderaddress boolean overwrite boolean priority int downloadmanagerpro addtask string savename string

divided into string sdcardfolder location of where user want to save the file boolean overwrite overwrite if exists another file with the same name if true overwrite and replace the file if false find new name and save it with new name boolean priority grant priority to more desired files to be downloaded return int task id task token this method usage is to start a download task if download task doesn t get started since this task is in downloading state it throw you an ioexception when download task start to download this lib notify you with ondownloadstarted interface void downloadmanagerpro startdownload int token throws ioexception int token it is an assigned token to each new download which is considered as download task id dm startdownload tasktoekn catch

int token it is an assigned token to each new download which is considered as download task id dm pausedownload tasktoekn startqueuedownload method create a queue sort on what you want and start

printstacktrace in this section we are working with reports since we need to get tasks status and some useful information about those status  it reports task download information in reportstructure style using a token download task id and finally returns the statue of that token reportstruct downloadmanagerpro singledownloadstatus int token int token task token return reportstructure object and it has a method to convert these info to json int id task token string name file name that will be saved on your sdcard int state download state number string url file download link long filesize

ondownloadcompleted long tasktoken interface list reportstructure report dm downloadtasksinsamestate taskstate init this method returns list of last completed download tasks in reportstructure style developers can use it for notifying whether the task is completed or not list downloadmanagerpro lastcompletedtasks return list reportstructure list of completed download from last called unnotifiedcheck method till now list reportstructure completeddownloadtasks dm lastcompletedtasks  this method checks all un notified tasks so in another lastcompleteddownloads call completed task

40587181, a simple responsive and tiny css grid for humans who don t like memorising all those cryptic codes like col  or something you must be thinking there are like a thousand grid frameworks so why another one what s so special about this one well there are three types of people who use css grids in their own way first the ones who just memorize the cryptic codes like col md  or whatever from their favourite css framework like bootstrap or foundation and not long before i too was in this category using bootstrap s grid all the time third the ones who like to count number of rows and columns but in a simple human like language trust me gridism is awesome and it simplifies stuff like anything but still sometimes i felt the one third two fifths golden small n all are a bit of confusing for me at least and gridism is just a  column grid which can sometimes be a bit limiting compared to  column grids what if i wanted a simple  column layout and i could say that i want this div to be of size of four columns and another div in the same row with size of eight columns what if i wanted to use offsets this made me think about a grid which will focus on both the second and third category of people a grid which can be used like traditional row column layout or the more contemporary thinking of dividing the page like half or one third or something so pills has two parts not literally i mean there is just one file that is pills css first this will have a  columns for that granular control but still would be simple enough like english language second inspired by gridism thinking and catering to people who think fractional division of page is simpler bower install pills also you can download it using npm npm install pills add the following stylesheet to your html s head section link rel stylesheet href bowercomponents and pills and dist and pills min css note if you didn t install using bower you need to adjust the path of the css file to match your file structure add the following meta tag to your html s head section meta name viewport content width device widthinitial scale  without this meta tag mobiles and tablets might load your page as a scaled down version of the desktop size instead of resizing the content to match the device s actual viewport width install npm dev dependencies npm install for compiling scss files and watching the changes a part of pills is to build using columns classes which are inside of a row class the row class encapsulates the columns as pills uses a twelve column grid the twelve columns class will take up the whole of the row and div you can mix it up however you like though and div and div you can put a row class inside of a column class in order to nest columns and div and div and div and div and div you can also offset a column as per your wish the second part of pills consists of a five column layout with division of page in mind if you want to strech the column to the whole page just use whole along with column and div using two halves of the page and div and div this can also be nested like above and div and div and div and div and div you can also offset a column as per your wish wide px and div wider px and div no max width for the rows and div i d love to get contributions for this project this is just my amateur attempt at doing something which came to my mind i m all up for criticism if i ve done something wrong but do help me correct those by contributing to this project fork at your will

20993744, eazegraph  eazegraph is an android library for creating beautiful and fancy charts its main goal was to create a lighweight library which is easy to use and highly customizeable with an up to date look currently  different chart types are available which can be viewed below  b important and b this library is not intented for mathematical purposes like achartengine or androidplot it is intented to have a beautiful visual presentation of user related data where only one value is provided and the rest is calculated dynamically so for example it s not possible to push d values in the linechart and let them plot just like in our beloved math lessons if you want such functionality either you use one of the libraries i named before or you wait some time until i finished a mathematical plotting chart currently barcharts only support positive values i will provide this functionality later b your android application should use android api level  or higher in order to use this library and b chart types  bar chart stacked bar chart pie chart line chart  different chart types dynamic legend label generation possibility to use your own legend labels animations for every chart touch interaction for piechart and linechart various xml attributes for customizing the charts and much more examples on how to correctly use these charts are either below or you can view the source of the sample app i provided if you want to see the library in action just download the sample app from the playstore including in your project  add in your android app project folder in the build gradle under dependencies groovy dependencies compile com github blackfizz eazegraph    aar compile com nineoldandroids library    or if you want to use my new lightweight library without any interaction some new features then download this groovy dependencies compile com github blackfizz eazegraph   l aar compile com nineoldandroids library    the library uses the nineoldandroids support library to support the animations on older devices if you already use this library you don t have to include it that s it now you are ready to use the library before you use the project please prepare

support for vertical barchart    fixed many bugs and added zooming for linecharts and scrolling for barcharts if there are many values i had those things on my hdd for some months and never had the time to release it or to polish it i think this should be stable and release it for you guys i know there are some open issues and i really want to fix those error or implement new features but i am not able to do anything of those as i am completely busy with my university and work in addition to that i made a lightweight variant of the library for my work which can be downloaded as the version   l this removes every physical interaction with the library and only provides displaying functionality most of the work went into the valuelinechart as it now has a x grid with  stages i don t know when i have some time again to implement new stuff or fix bugs but i hope it won t be so long as my last absence happy using    added missing getter and setter for new attributes    fixed issue     added dynamic scaling for valuelinechart with the attribute egusedynamicscaling and the scaling factor can be set with egscalingfactor which should be between  and  when only high values are given the chart scales them down to achieve a better presentation without any loss of information added scrolling in barcharts piecharts animations are now running properly on android   devices autocenter and scrolling    removed the egstandardvalueindicatorstroke and egstandardvaluecolor attributes and created an extra standardvalue class which contains all these information doing this enabled the support for multiple standardvalues fixed issue  fixed bug in valuelinechart when inserting an empty series the previous indicator is still shown even when there is no data available fixed bug in piechart when an innerpadding is activated the animated inner circle sometimes is a little smaller than the piechart which led to colored edges tweaked the legend generation algorithm added comparable interface for barmodel  piemodel  valuelinepoint    did a complete code restructuring now adding the graph graph overlay and legend view is done by the basechart class and only calls methods which can be overwritten in the child graph classes this reduced many redundancies and the layout generation of the views is handled in one location based on the restructuring the padding attributes are now drawn and interpreted correctly and no chart has to include the padding in the calculation as it is handled in the layout generation    fixed bug in vlauelinechart where the egactivateindicatorshadow was not usable added the possibility to change colors for the legend added a toggle which activates the drawing of the currently selected valuelinechart point beneath the indicator egactivateindicatorshadow    piechart s inner value and valuelinechart s indicator value now can be extended with an unit piechart eginnervalueunit valuelinechart egindicatortextunit valuelinechart removed egindicatorcolor and made separate attributes for indicator line and text egindicatorlinecolor and egindicatortextcolor valuelinechart the indicator now support a shadow layer egactivateindicatorshadow  egindicatorshadowstrength  egindicatorshadowcolor    made egshowdecimal attribute available for every chart    values in bar chart are now always above the bar added innerpaddingcolor attribute    fixed onclick listener for barchart    added showvalues for barchart fixed issue  and made barcharts clickable little adjustments and fixes    documented complete sourcecode refactored the code and fixed some minor bugs    added support for android api level  and higher added nineoldandroids library to support animations on older devices    fixed issue  fixed bug in valuelinechart negativeoffset wasn t updated    fixed bug in piechart s current item calculation and autocenter    fixed bug in barcharts when layout size changed and the chart tried to calculate positions for empty elements    linechart s value will now set its position the the left of the indicator if it doesn t fit on the screen fixed bug where the linechart graphoverlay wasn t updated when new values are imported    the opening animation can now be opened clockwise or counterclockwise use attribute egopenclockwise    added possibility to use a custom set inner value in piechart    added x axis for line charts line charts now support negative values    added standard value for line chart and the corresponding xml attributes fixed some calculation bugs which caused some displaying errors when a lot of data is inserted added clearing methods for charts fixed the legend calculation function    added eg namespace for attributes    initial commit of this library

8059275, simple fluid nestable flexible sass based responsive grid system fully responsive mobile first infinitely nestable reversible and reorderable with and without gutters endless possible combinations simple to understand human friendly classes option to keep classes out of your html no clear or last classes it just works for a comprehensive overview of the principles of the grid system simply fill in and adjust the relevant variables responsive is used to turn csswizardry grids responsive features on and off csswizardry grids is designed primarily for responsive builds but can also be used on non responsive projects just as easily setting this to false will simply prevent sass generating your palm etc modifiers gutter controls how much space there is between columns mobile first controls whether you would like unclassed grid items to initially adopt width  this means that you won t need to add a class to force a grid item to take up the full width of its container use silent classes tells csswizardry grids whether to go ahead and compile solid traditional classes e g one whole or to create sass  silent classes which only compile to css once explictly called lap start and desk start tell csswizardry grids when to fire particular media queries to service those particular sizes note that csswizardry grids works out the ends of any other breakpoints by using these numbers csswizardry grids is incredibly simple to implement its classes are all human readable and follow the same pattern csswizardry grids classes are based on a modified bem grid is a b lock griditem is an e lement grid rev is a m odifier classes include your breakpoint namespaces e g palm one half  desk two thirds and so on your push and pull classes push one third  pull desk one quarter and so on your regular classes one tenth  three quarters etc knowing these patterns will allow you to create hundreds of different combinations a few examples sets an item to be one half across all breakpoints one half pushes an item one third of the way to the right across all breakpoints push one third sets an item to be ten twelfths wide only at the desk breakpoint desk ten twelthfs pulls an item one half of the way to the left only at the palm breakpoint pull palm one half if you are using traditional classes then an example basic usage might look like this   and div and div it s as simple as that note the empty html comments these are to remove whitespace caused by using inline block prior to v  this was tackled by using some however chrome  introduced a change which meant this method now broke csswizardry grids if you d rather not use html comments to remove the whitespace then you can set the use markup fix variable to false this invokes a css hack that cannot be guaranteed always take care to check things over if using this method if you need to use csswizardry grids with a cms or data coming out of a loop you will need to format your template something a little like this items array foo  bar  baz foreach items as item item note the opening and closing comments before and after the loop and the corresponding opening and closing comments facing outward from the griditem element try pasting the above into the codepad for a counter if you are using silent classes use silent classes true then your html might look like this   and div and div  and your sass something like this page extend grid content sub content extend griditem extend one whole extend lap one half  content extend desk two thirds  sub content extend desk one third  csswizardry grids has the option to reverse a set of grids this means that the order you write your source and the order it renders are total opposites for i appear first in the markup but render second in the page i appear second in the markup but render first in the page and div and div this is handy if you want to lay out your page a certain way visually but it would be advantageous to order the source differently for example to aid accessibility getting a screenreader to read more important content first it may be desirable at times to have no gutter between your grid items with csswizardry grids this is as simple as look ma no gutter look ma no gutter and div and div keep grids in their correct order but have them flush right instead of left i render first but start in the middle of the page i render second and appear at the very right edge of the page and div and div you can centrally align your grids by simply using the grid center modifier i m in the middle and div and div you can vertically align your grids to each other by simply using the grid middle and bottom modifiers i m in the middle and div i m in the middle and div and div you can quickly alter the gutter size of your grids to half grid narrow or double grid wide by using the relevant modifiers i m a narrow guttered grid and div i m a narrow guttered grid and div and div if you have any trouble setting csswizardry grids up or would like some help using and implementing it or any questions about how it works then please feel csswizardry grids sass can look a little daunting but it s doing

8262363, make continuous deployment safe by comparing before and after webpage screenshots for each release depicted shows when any visual perceptual differences are found this is the ultimate automated end to end test depicted is a local command line tool local depicted for doing perceptual diff testing an api server and workflow depicted server for capturing webpage screenshots and automatically generating visual perceptual difference images a workflow for teams to coordinate new releases using pdiffs a client library for integrating the server with existing continuous integration built for portability server runs with sqlite mysql behind the firewall etc open source apache   licensed not a framework not a religion local dpxdt is a tool for generating screenshots it reads in a yaml config file and generates screenshots using phantomjs this makes sense for testing reusable tools e g libraries which aren t deployed in the way that a traditional web app is to get started with run pip install dpxdt create a simple page to screenshot h dpxdt local demo and h and a config file to specify what to screenshot python m simplehttpserver timeoutsecs  name demo config the setup stanza is a bash script which typically starts the server you want to screenshot note that this script doesn t terminate dpxdt will kill it when it s done the waitfor stanza tells dpxdt how it will know whether the server is ready for screenshotting this stanza can be a bash script as well but typically it suffices to specify a url and a timeout dpxdt will repeatedly fetch the url until it resolves i e returns status code  the tests section specifies a list of urls to fetch the name value identifies the test and is also used as the output file name you can run this simple test via dpxdt update tests here s what it looks like dpxdt update tests demo running webpage capture process demo updated tests and demo png this looks for yaml files in the tests directory and processes each in turn it starts the simplehttpserver  captures a screenshot and writes it to tests and demo png the screenshot is x with a transparent background this is probably not what you want you can override these settings with the config stanza python m simplehttpserver timeoutsecs  name demo config viewportsize width  height  injectcss and body background color white  local dpxdt has two modes update and test as we ve seen above update saves screenshots to the test directory test takes screenshots and compares them to the saved versions for example dpxdt test tests demo running webpage capture process demo resizing reference image demo running perceptual diff process demo passed no diff all tests passed now if we change demo html h dpxdt local demo and h and run the test command again dpxdt test tests demo running webpage capture process demo resizing reference image demo running perceptual diff process demo failed   distortion ref and tmp and and tmprmuvh and refresized run and tmp and and tmprmuvh and screenshot png diff and tmp and and tmprmuvh and diff png all and tmp and and tmprmuvh and refresizedscreenshot pngdiff png  test s failed dpxdt has output a triplet of images reference run and diff you can open all of them at once by copying the all line for example on mac os x open and tmp and and tmprmuvh and refresizedscreenshot pngdiff png here s what they look like and which and image and and and and the red portions of the diff image highlight where the change is these might be difficult to spot without a perceptual diff most tests will share a similar config stanza as your you write more tests this gets quite repetitive yaml supports a syntax for references which greatly reduces the repetition python m simplehttpserver timeoutsecs  standard config stdconfig viewportsize width  height  injectcss body background color white  name demo config stdconfig name demo with click config stdconfig injectjs and button click as the last example shows you can mix in a config and add to it if you include a stanza which is already in the mixed in config e g viewportsize  it will override it topics in this section warning label this is only for local development if you actually want a reliable server that will run for days see the section on deployment deployment below  clone this git repo in your terminal  cd to the repo directory  create a new python virtual environment and activate it virtualenv source bin and activate  install all dependencies into the environment pip install r requirements txt pip install e  execute and runshell sh and run these commands to initialize your db server db dropall server db createall  run the combined server and worker with and runcombined sh  login and create a new build  execute the and runurlpairdiff sh tool to verify everything is working and runurlpairdiff sh uploadbuildid   follow the url the tool writes to the terminal and verify screenshots are present any errors will be printed to the log in the terminal where you are running the server process  deactivate your virtual environment deactivate here are the steps to making depicted useful to you  establish a baseline release with an initial set of screenshots of your site  create a new release with a new set of screenshots of your new version  manually approve or reject each difference the tool finds  manually mark the new release as good or bad  repeat your approved release will become the baseline for the next one depicted organizes your releases by a build id you can create a build through the api server s ui a build is usually synonymous with a binary that s pushed to production but it could also be a unique view into one product like one build for desktop web and another for mobile web within a build are releases with names i recommend naming a release as the day it was branched in your source repository and maybe an attempt number like   r for june th release  if you use codenames for your releases like bumblebee  that works too each release may be attempted many times the full history of each release attempt is saved in the ui releases can be manually marked as good or bad in the ui when results for a new release are uploaded they will automatically be compared to the last known good version within that build a release consists of many separate test runs a test run is a single screenshot of a single page a test run has a name that is used to pair it up with a baseline test run from the known good previous release usually the test run is named as the path of the url being tested like and foo bar meep this lets the baseline release and new release serve on different hostnames the life cycle of a release  created a new release is created with a specific name the system gives it a release number  receiving the release is waiting for all test runs to be requested or reported  processing all test runs have been reported but additional processing like screenshotting or pdiffing is required  reviewing all test runs have been processed now the build admin should review any pdiffs that were found and approve the release final release states bad the build admin has marked the release and all its test runs as bad it will never be used as a baseline good the build admin has marked the release and all of its test runs as passing the next release created for this build will use this just approved release as the new baseline here are some example tools that show you how to use depicted and its api which is documented in detail api below an example client tool that exercises the whole workflow is available in the repo and dpxdt and tools and sitediff py it s called site diff it will crawl a webpage follow all links with the same prefix path then create a new release that screenshots all the urls running the tool multiple times lets you diff your entire site with little effort site diff is very helpful for example when you have a blog with a lot of content and want to make a change to your base template and be sure you haven t broken any pages here s an example invocation of site diff for your local server and runsitediff sh uploadbuildid  crawldepth  here s an example invocation of site diff against a real api server and dpxdt and tools and sitediff py uploadbuildid  releaseclientid your api key releaseclientsecret your api secret crawldepth  note when you use this the uploadbuildid above should be changed to match your build id in the ui for example you should use uploadbuildid  if your web site has got http basic authentication then you can add the username and password with additionals parameters httpusername and httppassword previous example would be and dpxdt and tools and sitediff py uploadbuildid  releaseclientid your api key releaseclientsecret your api secret crawldepth  httpusername user httppassword pass another example tool is available in the repo and dpxdt and tools and urlpairdiff py called pair diff unlike site diff which establishes a baseline on each subsequent run pair diff takes two live urls and compares them this is useful when you have a live version and staging version of your site both available at the same time and can do screenshots of both independently here s an example run of pair diff for your local server and runurlpairdiff sh uploadbuildid  here s an example run of pair diff against a real api server and dpxdt and tools and urlpairdiff py uploadbuildid  releaseclientid your api key releaseclientsecret your api secret same as sitediff py if your web sites have got http basic authentication then you can add the username and password with additionals parameters httpusername and httppassword note that the password must be the same for both web sites or one of them must have no authentication enabled for example previous example would be and dpxdt and tools and urlpairdiff py uploadbuildid  releaseclientid your api key releaseclientsecret your api secret httpusername user httppassword pass one more example tool is available in the repo and dpxdt and tools and diffmyimages py called diff my images this client plugs screenshots generated in a tool like selenium into depicted it uses the last known good screenshots for tests with the same name as the baseline for comparison depicted will generate diffs for you and manage the workflow to try this out on your local server first establish a baseline and rundiffmyimages sh uploadbuildid  testsjsonpath tests and testdata and mytests json uploadreleasename awesome and rundiffmyimages sh uploadbuildid  testsjsonpath tests and testdata and mytests json uploadreleasename awesome this example app works by reading a config file like this name my homepage  runfailed false imagepath tests and testdata and jellybean png  logpath tests and testdata and testlog txt  name my other page  runfailed false imagepath tests and testdata and jellybellybeans png  logpath and tmp and testlog txt  see the source code and dpxdt and tools and diffmyimages py for more details yet another example tool is available in the repo and dpxdt and tools and diffmyurls py called diff my urls this client runs a diff on a set of urls that are provided in a config file it makes it very easy to only test the urls you care about in a way that can be checked into source control and updated currently the tool consumes json and assumes that json data would be generated by another script or from a more concise representation like yaml to try this out on your local server do and rundiffmyurls sh uploadbuildid  uploadreleasename my release

foo  the api is really simple all requests are posts with parameters that are url encoded all responses are json all requests should be over https the api server uses http basic authentication to verify your client has access to your builds you can provision api keys for a build on its homepage at the bottom here s an example request to the api server using curl pretty easy curl v u apikey apipassword f buildid  f runname and static and dummy and dummypage html f releasenumber  f log dcffcbaeadcaedad f releasename        all of these requests are posts with url encoded or multipart and form data bodies and require http basic authentication using your api key as the username and secret as the password all responses are json the success key will be present in all responses and true if the request was successful if success isn t present a human readable error message may be present in the response under the key error endpoints creates a new release candidate for a build buildid id

1877150, stud is now officially abandonware thanks for playing stud the scalable tls unwrapping daemon  stud is a network proxy that terminates tls and ssl connections and forwards the unencrypted traffic to some backend it s designed to handle s of thousands of connections efficiently on multicore machines it follows a process per core model a parent process spawns n children who each accept on a common socket to distribute connected clients among them within each child asynchronous socket i and o is conducted across the local connections using libev and openssl s nonblocking api by default stud has an overhead of kb per connection it preallocates some buffer space for data in flight between frontend and backend stud has very few features it s designed to be paired with an intelligent backend like haproxy or nginx it maintains a strict   connection pattern with this backend handler so that the backend can dictate throttling behavior maxmium connection behavior availability of service etc stud will optionally write the client ip address as the first few octets depending on ipv or ipv to the backend or provide that information using haproxy s proxy protocol when used with the proxy protocol stud can also transparently pass an existing proxy header to the cleartext stream this is especially useful if a tcp proxy is used in front of stud using either of these techniques backends who care about the client ip can still access it even though stud itself appears to be the connected client thanks to a contribution from emeric at exceliance the folks behind haproxy  a special build of stud can be made that utilitizes shared memory to use a common session cache between all child processes this can speed up large stud deployments by avoiding client renegotiation  please be aware of the policy regarding releases code stability and security in git the tip of the master branch should always build on linux and freebsd and is likely to be as stable as any other changeset a careful review of patches is conducted before being pushed to github periodically a version tag will be pushed to github for an old er changeset     etc these tags mark a particular release of stud that has seen heavy testing and several weeks of production stability conservative users are advised to use a tag stud has an optional build that utilizes shared memory based ssl contexts and udp peer communication to keep a session cache between many child processes running on many machines the use of this build can dramatically speed up ssl handshakes on many core and and or clustered deployments however it s important to acknowledge the inevitable theoretical security tradeoffs associated with the use of this substantially more complex binary therefore the deeply paranoid are advised to use only the standard stud binary at the cost of some performance requirements and limitations  stud requires libev  openssl recent    recommended stud currently works on linux openbsd freebsd and macosx it has been tested the most heavily on linux and x while porting it to other posix platforms is likely trivial it hasn t be done yet patches welcome if you re handling a large number of connections you ll probably want to raise ulimit n before running stud it s very strongly recommended to not run stud as root ideally it would be run as a user stud  perhaps that does nothing but run stud stud will setuid using u after binding if you need to bind to a low port  installing  to install stud make sudo make install the only required argument is a path to a pem file that contains the certificate or a chain of certificates and private key if multiple certificates are given stud will attempt to perform sni server name indication on new connections by comparing the indicated name with the names on each of the certificates in order the first certificate that matches will be used if none of the certificates matches the last certificate will be used

50404623, tl dr there are a lot of tools to compile es to es when choosing your compile stack you should be aware that tools that perform tree shaking and topological sorts of your code dependencies will result in smaller code bundles and faster js execution times  with the recent es boom  javascript developers have a myriad of combinatorial choices when it comes to writing es and compiling that code to es or lower from closure compiler to browserify to uglify to webpack it is hard to know what is the best for compiling es to run in browsers today malte s post got me thinking about how each of the tools available to developers have a slightly different approach when it comes to dealing with import statements and combining multiple files together the following analysis aims to look at the cost across multiple tools when the goal is to deliver a single js blob down to the user when writing vanilla non annotated es to start with let s take a look at this simple bit of code above is vanilla es code to run this code in a browser however we first have to convert it to es using one of several options initially let s try babel and browserify closure compiler and rollup and then compare the output  compiling this example with babel and browserify results in the following bundle now compare that result to using closure compiler using no optimization flags finally looking at rollup rollup simply dead code eliminates everything as you can see you are paying a fairly high cost per module when using a tool like browserify as compared to closure or rollup this simply put boils down to overhead per module which increases the overall size of your bundle  file bundle size gzip size tool run time gathered by time make tool as a side note the numbers that i gathered from the compile time metric and execution time were all within the margin of error of one another so i will not be using those numbers to draw a hypothesis but the results are included at the end of the post ignoring the outlier of traceur people should heavily consider using a tool that does tree shaking removal of unused code and topological sorting of dependencies ordering the dependencies so that you do not have to worry about import wrapping code the difference between the final output size between a tool like browserify and rollup can well over   even for a trivial app like todomvc  and tools and file size bytes and gzip size bytes and brotli size bytes and js execution time ms and js compile time ms and tool run time s and and and and and and and and and and closure and  and  and  and   and   and   and and jspm   babel and rollup and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and typescript and webpack and  and  and  and   and   and   and and babel and rollup and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and typescript and browserify and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and rollup plugin babel and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and webpack  and babel and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and webpack and babel and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and babel and browserify and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and babelify and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and and traceur and browserify and uglify and  and  and  and   and   and   and  make babel and closure and typescript and rollup and traceur and make example name make size open demo in chrome save timeline trace npm i g bigrig cd src python m simplehttpserver visit localhost  and
11511219, set text on the web to a baseline grid with sass rems using a responsive modular scale please note this code is p old now and is no longer actively maintained sassline has one aim and one aim only  to spread better typography across the responsive environment of the web the idea is to have easy to use and maintain scss partials utilising the power of sass to make the complex calculations to set type on a baseline grid on the web with a production ready css output using rems for the font sizing and the spacing measurements gives a simple way to use the proportions of the baseline grid throughout the design sass mixins do all the heavy lifting so your job is easy opentype features are enabled with font feature settings to give the most appropriate formatting of text and some flourishes in the headings if available in the web font and supported in the browser sassline includes some basic layouts and includes mixins to create a main column with optimal measure and a sidebar that doesn t get too narrow sassline works by setting the root font size as half the line height of the standard paragraph text the height of the baseline grid is then effectively set at rem with increments at each rem this makes it nice and easy to work proportionally from the baseline with integer rem values to create harmony in your layout and typography this is based off a technique for setting text in print documents sassline is fully commented with details in the scss set the font sizes with the fontsize mixin set the spacing using the baseline mixin or set both at once with the sassline mixin use rems for everything else full documentation is in the works you can also use your preferred methods for compiling sass as long as you have sass    and to just include the necessary partials in your existing sass project you only need to import sassline base scss assets and sass and sassline base scss if you want to run sassline as a standalone project use the gulp setup included or modify it to your needs  clone the repo or grab the zip file  open a terminal window and cd into this directory  run npm install g gulp this may need sudo in front  run npm install once that is done you can start the server with gulp and stop it with ctrl and c my preferred method is to work along the lines of the smacss bem method in the sass folder there there are two folders  sassline base and modules the base folder has the sassline base scss partials the modules folder contains some demo scss partials with styles you can keep or remove all new partials should be added to the modules folder and referenced in style scss to be compiled into your css sassline will set text to the baseline in recent versions of chrome and firefox ie  and and safari  and full documentation

29765109, demo demo gif this is a layout that clones the interaction of going through cities in the city guide app this app is  for the top ios app animations on the raywenderlich to use this simply drop it in as a class in the storyboard or nib when you create your collection view or you can instantiate it in code and give it your collection view via initwithframe collectionviewlayout or just set the layout propery of the collection view and you can use your collection view as you always do one important this for this layout is that in the datasource protcol to specify the number of cards you must use numberofsectionsincollectionview  and for collectionview numberofitemsinsection you must always return  also note that the itemsize is computed by the layout to be appropriate to the size of the collection view itself so setting it won t do anything place the following line into your podfile to use rgcardviewlayout pod rgcardviewlayout

application it configures fluxible with src and containers and root js src and containers and root js as the root component it registers the stores so they can work on the same react context it makes possible to dehydrate the stores on the server src and server and render js and rehydrate them on the client src and client js instead of directly listening to stores components use fluxible s connecttostores decorator a store state is passed to components as prop see for example the photopage src and containers and photopage js or the featuredpage src and containers and featuredpage js connecttostore can also consume store data without actually listening to any store this is the case of navbar src and components and navbar js or localeswitcher src and components and localeswitcher js while rest apis usually return collections as arrays a resource store keeps items as big object  like the photostore src and stores and photostore js this simplifies the progressive resource updates that may happen during the app s life a list store keeps references to a resource store as the featuredstore src and stores and featuredstore js holds the ids of the photos in photostore src and stores and photostore js the htmlheadstore src and stores and htmlheadstore js is a special store used to set the head meta tags in the html component during server side rendering it is also listened by the application component to change the browser s document title this store listens to route actions and set its content according to the current route it also get data from other stores e g the photo s title from the photostore  or the localized messages from the intlstore the user may want to override the detected locale the localeswitcher src and components and localeswitcher js component set a cookie when the user chooses a language also we enable the hl parameter in the query string to override it server side cookie and query string are detected by the setlocale src and server and setlocale js middleware react intl requires some boilerplate to work properly difficulties here arise mainly for two reasons  for each language we need to load a set of locale data used by intl to format numbers and dates and the translated strings called messages used by react intl while on node js we can load them in memory on the client they need to be downloaded first  and we want to download only the relevant data for the current locale on the server the solution is easy as said the server loads a polyfill src and server and intl polyfill including both intl and the locale data for supporting the browser we can instead rely on our technology stack i e flux and webpack on the client  we have to load the intl polyfill and its locale data before rendering the app i e in client js src and client js for this purpose i used webpack s require ensure to split intl and localized data in multiple chunks only after they have been downloaded the app can be mounted see the loadintlpolyfill and loadlocaledata functions in intlutils src and utils and intlutils js they return a promise that is resolved when the webpack chunks are downloaded and require d they are used in client js client js before mounting the app important since react intl assumes intl is already in the global scope we can t import the fluxible app which imports react intl in some of its components before polyfilling intl that s why you see in client js src and client js require and app inside the in the renderapp function and not as import on the top of the file lets talk about the data that react intl needs to deliver translated content translated messages are saved in the intl src and intl directory and shared between client and server using the intlstore stores and intlstore this store listens to a loadintlserver action dispatched by intlactioncreator src and actions and intlactioncreators js we execute this action only server side before rendering the html component together with the usual navigateaction this allows to dehydrate and rehydrate the store content react intl components need to have access to the intlstore plus since i m using es classes i can t adopt the react intl mixin in my components to solve this i wrap the formatted components and make them available from intlcomponents src and utils and intlcomponents js while this is not required by the px api we can send the current locale to the api so it can deliver localized content this is made very easy by the fetchr services since they expose the req object see for example the photo service src and services and photo js run the development version with npm run dev webpack is used as commonjs module bundler css builder using sass loader and assets loader images and svg files plugin to get notified on errors while compiling the code on mac you must brew install terminal notifier the production config and webpack and prod config js builds the client side production bundle from npm run build both configs set a process env browser global variable useful to require css from the components e g and and mycomponent if process env browser require and style and mycomponent scss on production files bundled by webpack are hashed javascript and css file names are saved in a static and dists and stats json which is read by the html src and containers and html js component npm run lint debug isomorphicfluxible node index debug node index from the browser  you can enable and disable them by sending this command in the javascript console debug enable isomorphic debug disable and

is enabled tap on the preview to focus on a specific point focus distance manually control focus distance if auto focus is turned off exposure tap on either shutter speed or iso values to enable manual exposure control aperture show the aperture of the camera currently all devices that support the new camera api have fixed aperture and therefore this setting cannot be changed shutter speed

possible burst mode capture up to  image at maximum resolution at  fps with optional exposure bracketing bulb mode keep capturing dng images until manually stopped note that as the nexus  s internal memory writing speed cannot keep up with the rate the camera pushes out new images even at the slowest shutter speed the camera waits until the previous image is saved before starting a new capture to avoid filling the buffers video mode videos are encoded with h  and avc for video and  khz kbps aac lc for audio in mp container focus distance and exposure settings are adjustable during recording settings photo mode save dng toggle whether a dng image is saved in single capture mode burst mode no of images number of images to be captured in burst note that the hardware may not be able to

of free space available to enable  and fps recording the system library and system and lib and libmmcameraimx so needs to be replaced with a modified version the following is a simplified walkthrough of the process note that this is a very hacky solution and i m not responsible for any damages done to your system or device approach at your own risk and make sure you understand what you are doing  launch a root shell  make a backup of the original library first cp and system and lib and libmmcameraimx so and sdcard and libmmcameraimxoriginal so  run mount o remountrw and system to re mount the and system partition for read write  replace the library install m and sdcard and libmmcameraimxlrxohz so and system and lib and libmmcameraimx so replace hz with hz if you downloaded the fps one  run mount o remountro and system to re mount and system as read only again  restart both the camera daemon and media server killall mm qcamera daemon mediaserver the camera should now be able to record at  and  fps and you can choose  and fps options in the settings menu on l camera all other camera apps will most likely be broken at this point if you want to undo the modification simply redo step   and copy the original library you backup ed in step  instead for details about the library modification and a utility to patch your own see contents of the libmmcameraimxmod directory make sure the downloaded apk is not corrupted as it seems some browsers download github s webpage instead of the actual apk you must also have the lollipop running on your device no however it is needed if you want to record videos at fps on the nexus  as a system library needs to be modified open an issue one per feature please on the tracker and i will see what i can do however the priority of development is investigating new ways to use the camera hardware rather than reimplement features that have been possible or things that can be done in post processing you must have both scala    and sbt   installed to build the app the resulting apk will be placed in the bin and directory sbt package to build and run the app on device assuming you have adb and developer mode enabled sbt run to see debug outputs set allowed logging priority of lcamera tag to verbose adb shell setprop log tag lcamera verbose please report any bugs or feature requests on github s issue tracker martin wawro for his support in

40089541, finding a good architecture for android applications is not easy google seems to not care much about it so there is no official recommendation on patterns beyond activities lifecycle management but defining an architecture for your application is important like it or not every application is going to have an architecture so you d better be the one defining it than let it just emerge current trend is to adapt clean architecture clean architecture  a  uncle bob proposal for web applications although clean architecture could be a little bit over engineered for most of the android apps out there typically mobile apps live shorter than web apps mobile technology is evolving so fast that any app released today is going to be completely deprecated in twelve months mobile apps usually do very little a very high percent of use cases are just for data consuming get data from api show data to user lot of reads very little writes as a result its business logic is not complex at least not as complex as backend apps well you have to deal with platform issues memory storage pause resume network location etc but that is not your app business logic you have all of that in every app so it seems that most of the apps out there will not benefit from things like complex layer divisions or job priority execution queues they may just need a simple way to organise code work together efficiently and find bugs easily flux architecture flux arch is used by facebook to build their client side web applications like clean architecture it is not intended for mobile apps but its features and simplicity will allow us to adapt it very well to android projects flux graph simple there are two key features to understand flux the data flow is always unidirectional an unidirectional data flow unidirectional is the core of the flux architecture and is what makes it so easy to learn it also provides great advantages when testing the application as discussed below the application is divided into three main parts view application interface it create actions in response to user interactions dispatcher central hub through which pass all actions and whose responsibility is to make them arrive to every store store maintain the state for a particular application domain they respond to actions according to current state execute business logic and emit a change event when they are done this event is used by the view to update its interface this three parts communicate through actions simple plain objects identified by a type containing the data related to that action the main target of using flux principles on android development is to build an architecture with a good balance between simplicity and ease of scale and test first step is to map flux elements with android app components two of this elements are very easy to figure out and implement view activity or fragment dispatcher an event bus i will use otto in my examples but any other implementation should be fine actions are not complex either they will be implemented as simple pojos with two main attributes type a string identifying the type of event data a map with the payload for this action for example a typical action to show some user details will look like this bundle data new bundle data put userid  id action action new viewaction showuser  data this is perhaps the most difficult to get flux concept also if you have worked with clean architecture before it also will be uncomfortable to accept because stores will assume responsibilities that were previously separated into different layers stores contain the status of the application and its business logic they are similar to rich data models but they can manage the status of various objects  not just one stores react to actions emitted by the dispatcher  execute business logic and emit a change event as result stores only output is this single event change any other component interested in a store internal status must listen to this event and use it to get the data it needs no other component of the system should need to know anything about the status of the application finally stores must expose an interface to obtain application status this way view elements can query the stores and update application ui in response flux graph store for example in a pub discovery app a searchstore will be used to keep track of searched item search results and the history of past searches in the same application a reviewedstore will contain a list of reviewed pubs and the necessary logic to for example sort by review however there is one important concept to keep in mind stores are not repositories their responsibility is not to get data from an external source api or db but only keep track of data provided by actions so how flux application obtain data in the initial flux graph i intentionally skipped one part network calls next graph completes first one adding more details flux graph complete asynchronous network calls are triggered from an actions creator a network adapter makes the asynchronous call to the corresponding api and returns the result to the actions creator finally the actions creator dispatch the corresponding typed action with returned data having all the network and asynchronous work out of the stores has has two main advantages your stores are completely synchronous this makes the logic inside a store very easy to follow bugs will be much easier to trace and since all state changes will be synchronous testing a store becomes an easy job launch actions and assert expected final state all actions are triggered from an action creator having a single point at which you create and launch all user actions greatly simplifies finding errors forget about digging into classes to find out where an action is originated everything starts here and because asynchronous calls occur before everything that comes out of actioncreator is synchronous this is a huge win that significantly improves traceability and testability of the code in this example android app you will find a classical to do app implemented on android using a flux architecture i tried to keep the project as simple as possible just to show how this architecture can produce very well organised apps some comments about implementation the dispatcher is implemented using otto bus any bus implementation will mostly work there is a flux restriction on events i m not applying here on original flux definition dispatching an event before previous one has finish is forbidden and will throw an exception to keep the project simple i m not implementing that here there is an actionscreator class to help creating actions and posting them into the dispatcher it is a pretty common pattern in flux which keeps things organised actions types are just string constants it is probably not the best implementation but is quick and helps keeping things simple same thing with actions data they are just a hashmap with a string key and object as a value this forces ugly castings on stores to extract actual data of course this is not type safe but again keeps the example easy to understand there is no such thing as the best architecture for an android app there is the best architecture for your current app and it is the one that let you collaborate with your teammates easily finish the project on time with quality and as less bugs as possible i believe flux is very good for all of that facebook flux overview flux arch
1585031, a library agnostic extensible dom utility nothing else it looks like this bonzo elements hide addclass foo color red  background color white show  contributing  function selector return bonzo qwery selector this now allows you to write the following code content a rel bookmark after  css text decoration  none one of the greatest parts about bonzo is its simplicity to hook into the internal chain to create custom methods for example you can create a method called color like this bonzo aug color function c return this css color  c and and you can now do the following p color aqua added in the ender bridge  factory function for bonzo objects takes in either a single domelement  or an array like object or array of them returns an array like bonzo object possessing all of the instance methods instance documented below var elem document getelementbyid foo var elem bonzo elem and and elem now has all the special powers listed below  returns the raw domelement held at index because bonzo objects are array like this is identical to saying bonzo index var elem document getelementbyid bar var elem bonzo elem var sameelem elem get  var sameelemagain elem  and and elem sameelem sameelem sameelemagain  allows you to iterate over the raw elements contained in bonzo collections fn gets called once for each element in the collection with each element in turn as its first argument if the optional scope argument is supplied then it is used as the this value of the function otherwise the same element that is passed as the first argument is used the index of the element is passed as the second argument and the collection itself is passed as the third  deepeach  map  bonzo html either sets or gets the elements innerhtml to content  depending if the optional content argument is pased in if called without the argument html returns the element s innerhtml content is an optional argument if it is passed in it will set the innerhtml of a given element and return a bonzo object  bonzo text is very similar to html api html  but uses the elements textcontent instead of innerhtml when setting the content thus the content will not get parsed as markup this method either gets or sets the text of a given element depending if the optional content argument is passed in content is an optional argument if it is passed in it will set the text value of a given element and return a bonzo object if no content is specified the text method will return the text that makes up that element if the element has children i e a ul containing several li children  the children s text is included in the return value bonzo h hello world and h text and and  returns hello world bonzo h i m going to change and h text changed you and and the h now says changed you and and  returns a bonzo object bonzo ul li one and li li two and li and ul text and and  returns one and and two bonzo ul li one and li li two and li and ul text hello and and the html is now ul hello and ul and and  returns a bonzo object  bonzo addclass class and classlist adds the specified class to the given element it returns a bonzo object class is a required argument it is the name of the class you wish to add to the given element if you d like to add multiple classes at once simply use a space separated string a classlist i e classone classtwo bonzo h hello world and h addclass big and and the html is now h class big hello world and h and and  returns a bonzo object bonzo h hello world and h addclass and and throws an error since the argument is required and and  returns a bonzo object  bonzo removeclass class removes the specified class from the given element it returns a bonzo object class is a required argument it is the name of the class you wish to remove from the given element if you d like to remove multiple classes at once simply use a space separated string a classlist i e classone classtwo bonzo h class small hello world and h removeclass small and and the html is now h class hello world and h and and  returns a bonzo object bonzo h class removeme hello world and h removeclass and and throws an error since the argument is required and and  returns a bonzo object bonzo h class error hello world and h removeclass doesnotexist and and  since the argument does not match a classlist the h has nothing happens and a bonzo object is returned  bonzo hasclass class returns true or false  based on whether or not the specified element has a given class it returns true if the specified element does have the class  and returns false if the specified element does not have the class class is a required argument it is the name of the class you wish to check for in a given element note if you pass in a space separated classlist like you can true if any of the space

33611781, a support library for vectordrawable  and animatedvectordrawable  introduced in lollipop with fully backwards compatible tint support api  and so far vector compat provides the necessary tools to make animated icons similar to the new drawer hamburger icon that morphs to a back arrow when clicked any other morph animation between icons can be defined purely in xml no java code required  and the library takes care of the transformation animation because they are in vector format these drawables can be of any height and width with no resulting pixelation the library will transparently fall back to the lollipop implementation of vectordrawable and animatedvectordrawable on api  and devices the library packs some ready made morph animations developers can use in their code with morphbutton more will be added soon as this is a work in progress the library has the following morph animations play pause morph animation bi directional morph play stop morph animation bi directional morph arrow hamburger menu morph animation bi directional morph the goal is to with time create a repo of commonly used morph animations that lots of developers find useful add the vector compat dependency to your build gradle file and make sure to use buildtoolsversion  or higher groovy android and and use version  or higher buildtoolsversion    dependencies compile com wnafee vector compat    if you re using proguard for code shrinking and obfuscation make sure to add the following proguard keep class com wnafee vector vectordrawable and animatedvectordrawable xml drawable syntax is exactly the same as the lollipop documentation can be seen here  and here  respectively with  caveats some attributes under the vector nodes must be listed once for the android namespace and once for the local namespace with a vc prefix e g app vcfillcolor see example here  for a complete list of vc prefixed attributes see attr xml  for any pathtype anim xml must have the android valuetype pathtype in addition to app vcvaluetype pathtype to allow for lollipop implementation fallback see example here  vectordrawable and animatedvectordrawable in this support library can be inflated in one of  ways calling static getdrawable methods and and this will only inflate a drawable with vector as the root element vectordrawable getdrawable context r drawable icarrowvector animatedvectordrawable getdrawable context r drawable icarrowtomenuanimatedvector and and this will inflate any drawable and will auto fallback to the lollipop implementation on api  and devices resourcescompat getdrawable context r drawable anydrawable if inflating the drawable in java code it is recommended to always use resourcescompat getdrawable as this handles lollipop fallback when applicable this allows the system to cache drawable constantstate and hence is more efficient directly from the morphbutton view in xml com wnafee vector morphbutton android id and id and playpausebtn android layoutwidth wrapcontent android layoutheight wrapcontent app vcstartdrawable drawable and icpausetoplay morphbutton is a compoundbutton with  states morphstate start or morphstate end the attributes vcstartdrawable and vcenddrawable define which foreground drawables to use for the button depending on the button s state these can be any type of drawable e g bitmapdrawable  colordrawable  vectordrawable  animatedvectordrawable etc to use morphbutton in your app make sure to include the morphbuttonstyle item in your base app theme style name myapptheme parent theme appcompat light darkactionbar item name morphbuttonstyle style and widget morphbutton and item morphbuttons allow you to tint your foreground drawables i e vcstartdrawable and vcenddrawable and background drawable separately in both xml and java see the following examples for defining morphbuttons com wnafee vector morphbutton android id and id and drawerbtn android layoutwidth wrapcontent android layoutheight

setenddrawable r drawable icplaytopause mb setstate morphstate end the scaletype attribute defines how to scale the foreground drawable to fill the button s background this is the same as imageview scaletype  which you can take a look at here  button clicks will toggle between the foreground drawables if the drawables happen to implement the animatable  interface e g animatedvectordrawable or animationdrawable then start will be automatically called to animate between the start and end drawables defined in xml morphbutton states can be set manually via setstate methods and and transition with no animation mymorphbutton setstate morphstate end and and or transition with animation if drawable is animatable mymorphbutton setstate morphstate start true if you need to be informed of button state changes you need to add an onstatechangedlistener mymorphbutton setonstatechangedlistener new onstatechangedlistener override public void onstatechanged morphstate changedto boolean isanimating

7599693, confide aims to be simple to use quick to configure and flexible current account confirmation through confirmation link password reset sending email with a change password link easily render forms for login signup and password reset generate routes for login signup password reset confirmation etc generate a customizable controller that handles the basic user account actions contains a set of methods to help with basic user features integrated with the laravel auth and reminders component and configs user validation login throttling redirecting to previous route after authentication checks for unique email and username in signup warning by default a confirmation email is sent and users are required to confirm the email address it is easy to change this in the confide config file change signupemail and signupconfirm to false if you do not want to send them an email and they do not need to be confirmed to be able to login to the website  in the require key of composer json file add the following zizaco and confide   dev run the composer update comand composer update in your config and app php add zizaco confide serviceprovider to the end of the providers array providers array illuminate foundation providers artisanserviceprovider  illuminate auth authserviceprovider  zizaco confide serviceprovider  at the end of config and app php add confide zizaco confide facade to the aliases array aliases array app illuminate support facades app  artisan illuminate support facades artisan  confide zizaco confide facade  set the properly values to the config and auth php this values will be used by confide to generate the database migration and to generate controllers and routes set the address and name from the from array in config and mail php those will be used to send account confirmation and password reset emails to the users now generate the confide migration and the reminder password table migration php artisan confide migration it will generate the timestamp confidesetupuserstable php migration you may now run it with the artisan migrate command php artisan migrate it will setup a table containing email  password  remembertoken  confirmationcode and confirmed columns which are the default fields needed for confide use feel free to add more columns to the table later change your user model in app and models and user php to use zizaco confide confideuser use zizaco confide confideuserinterface class user extends eloquent implements confideuserinterface use confideuser confideuser trait will take care of some behaviors of the user model lastly you can dump a default controller repository and the default routes for confide php artisan confide controller php artisan confide routes don t forget to dump composer autoload composer dump autoload basic setup  database connection in config and database php running properly  correct model and table names in config and auth php they will be used by confide all the time  specially when generating migrations and controllers   from configuration in config and mail php configuration  zizaco confide serviceprovider and confide zizaco confide facade entry in config and app php providers and aliases respectively  user model with the same name as in config and auth php should implement zizaco confide confideuserinterface interface this will cause to methods like forgotpassword and confirm to be available optional steps  optionally you can use the trait zizaco confide confideuser in your user model this will save a lot of time and will use confide s default implementation for the user if you wish more customization you can write your own code  use confide facade to dump login and signup forms easly with makeloginform and makesignupform you can render the forms within your views by doing confide makeloginform render  generate a controller and a repository with the template contained in confide throught the artisan command php artisan confide controller if a controller with the same name exists it will not be overwritten  generate routes matching the controller template throught the artisan command php artisan confide routes don t worry your routes php will not be overwritten you may have noticed that when generating the controller a userrepository class has also been created this class contains some code that doesn t belong to the controller purpose and will make your users controller a cleaner and more testable class if you still have no idea why that class exists i recommend you to google  creating flexible controllers in laravel  using repositories   wink  you can change the model name that will be considered the user in the config and auth php file confide uses the values present in that configuration file to change the controller name when dumping the default controller template you can use the name option php artisan confide controller name employee will result in employeecontroller then when dumping the routes you should use the controller option to match the existing controller php artisan confide routes controller employee you can also generate controllers with namespace php artisan confide controller name myproject auth user warning in bash you will need to use double backslashes this will result in myproject auth usercontroller also the generated file will be inside a directory equivalent to the namespace  wink  first publish the config files php artisan config publish zizaco and confide then edit the view names in app and config and packages and zizaco and confide and config php to seed your users table you should fill also the passwordconfirmation and confirmationcode fields for example class userstableseeder extends seeder public function run user new user user email johndoe site dev user password foobar user passwordconfirmation foobar user confirmationcode md uniqid mtrand  true user confirmed  if user save log info unable to create user user email array user errors else log info created user user email  you can implement your own validator by creating a class that implements the uservalidatorinterface and registering that class as confide uservalidator for example create your custom validator class and and app and models and myownvalidator php class myownvalidator implements uservalidatorinterface public function validate confideuserinterface user unset user passwordconfirmation return true and and if the user valid then register it in ioc container as confide uservalidator and and app and start and global php app bind confide uservalidator  myownvalidator also don t forget that your validator should unset the passwordconfirmation attribute of the user before saving it if you want to pass additional parameters to the forms being rendered you can use an alternate syntax to achieve this instead of using the make method confide makeresetpasswordform token you would use view make config get confide resetpasswordform with token  token it produces the same output but you would be able to add more inputs using with just like any other view php artisan confide controller restful then when dumping the routes you should use the restful option to match the existing controller php artisan confide routes restful when defining your filter you should use the redirect guest users and login within your auth filter for example and and filters php route filter auth  function and and if the user is not logged in if auth guest return redirect guest users and login and and only authenticated users will be able to access routes that begins with and and admin ex admin and posts  admin and categories route when admin  auth and and filters php entrust routeneedsrole admin  admin  function return redirect guest users and login finally it ll auto redirect if your controller s users and login function uses redirect intended a and default and url and here after a successful login        production error exception illuminate database queryexception with message sqlstate s column not found  unknown column passwordconfirmation in field list sql insert into users  the passwordconfirmation attribute should be removed from the object before being sent to the database make sure your user model implement the confideuserinterface and that it use the confideuser trait as described above user model otherwise if you are using a custom validator you will have to unset passwordconfirmation before saving the user i need my users to have an username  use the username option when generating the confide migration and the controller php artisan confide migration username php artisan confide controller username if you want to make the username a required field you will have to extend the uservalidator custom user validation and overwrite the rules attribute making the  username  required i receive a your account may not be confirmed when trying to login you need to confirm a newly created user  by reaching its confirm method  otherwise you can disable the confirmation as a requirement to login in in the config file  see bellow  you can easly confirm an user manually using laravel s artisan tinker tool i m not able to generate a controller with namespaces in bash you will need to use double backslashes also the generated file will be inside a directory equivalent to the namespace php artisan confide controller name myproject auth user users are able to login without confirming account if you want only confirmed users to login in your usercontroller  instead of simply calling logattempt input  call logattempt input true the second parameter stands for  confirmedonly  my application is crashing since i ran composer update confide    was a huge update where all the codebase has been rewritten some classes changed the generators has been improved in order to match some better practices like repositories and separated validator classes see the release notes bellow if you have a legacy project that uses an older version of confide don t worry you will be always able to specify a previous version in your composer json file for example zizaco and confide   will avoid composer download version   but will be able to download bugfixes of version   username is now an optional field use username when generating the migrations and the controllers general bugfixes general bugfixes improved readme md improved existing translations and added new ones general bugfixes improved readme md confide can use queues for sending email account confirmation tokens are not time based anymore now you can customize how long will take for a password reset request to expire default to  hours reordered validations now all validations are called even if one of them fails so all validation messages are sent at once validateisunique method now sends key to attacherrormsg and also check for errors on each identity field at once uservalidator now adds errors to an existing messagebag instead of replacing it password reset token will expire after  days added support for custom connections using the connection attribute of the model password reset requests are deleted after being used dropped ardent dependency updated to support laravel   dropped support for php   confideuser is going to be a trait and interface from now on controller generation now also generates an userrepository class removed deprecated variables functions and classes all the codebase has been rewritten upgrade note  a partial update from previous versions is not recommended in order to upgrade from v to v   the best approach is to update the class names in the providers and aliases array re generate the user table with the new migration re write the user class and finally re generate the controllers it s very likely any customization made in your codebase will be affected updated to support laravel   removed deprecated variable and functions updaterules amend generateuuid getupdaterules preparerules getrules setupdaterules getuserfromcredsidentity checkuserexists isconfirmed adds two config values logincachefield  throttletimeperiod  readme update pulls in a few pull requests and also locks to ardent   x properly handles validation messaging  properly validates in realsave  auth redirect is handled using redirect guest instead of a custom session variable  bruteforce vulnerability is addressed  locked to ardent   x add phpdoc blocks for all classes methods and functions omit the return tag if the method does not return anything add a blank line before param  return and throws

applications built in support for domains and redirects built in support for tls and wildcard certificates built in support for docker args and container persistent volumes built in support for container s top built in support for foreman based procfile data volumes with host based volumes preboot and zero downtime deploy enter and exec commands in already running containers access control deploy only keys create only application http basic auth support simple ssl commands spdy and hsts configure nginx listen address and proxy read timeout custom buildstep image support better image tagging yet compatible with dokku support for running buildstep based applications as non root user run dokku alt in service in docker container beta nginx proxy in container with automatic service reload support for rabbitmq and memcached support for custom nginx templates support for application scaling full and incremental backup application migration assumes that you use ubuntu   lts right now ideally you should have a domain ready to point to your host it s designed for and is probably best to use a fresh vm the debian package will install everything it needs sometimes you may want to install dokku alt in a completely non interactive way now you can do it simply boostrap sh without terminal that s it you ll have to add a public key associated with a username by doing something like this from your local machine cat and ssh and idrsa pub and ssh dokku me sudo dokku access add unlike dokku  this script uses the debian packaging system deb to upgrade to the latest version simply execute sudo apt get update sudo apt get install dokku alt alongside the normal stable releases we distribute as well beta bleeding edge to switch to beta simply execute sudo apt get update sudo apt get install dokku alt beta it will replace the stable dokku alt and switch to beta it should be possible it should mostly work but it s not tested and advised vps s are very cheap this days so fire up new machine and setup dokku alt from scratch cd node js sample git remote add dokku dokku dokku alt com node js app git push dokku master counting objects  done delta compression using up to  threads compressing objects   and   done writing objects   and     kib done total  delta   reused  delta  building node js app node js app detected resolving engine versions blah blah blah application deployed you re done please check the documentation for your particular build pack as you may need to include configuration files such as a procfile in your project root it s a web interface to easily manage your dokku alt instance to install manager simply run dokku manager install you can enable or disable it anytime dokku manager enable dokku manager disable or even uninstall if you prefer command line access it will also wipe used database dokku manager uninstall all dokku alt services ssh nginx dokku daemon are run in container docker run volume and home and dokku volume and var and lib and docker name dokku alt data busybox latest docker run d name dokku alt hostname my domain com volumes from dokku alt data publish   publish   publish   privileged ayufan and dokku alt latest you can adjust the exposed ports as described in docker documentation docker logs dokku alt demo at the end you should see something like this dokku  and ssh login dokku  and user root dokku  and password lfmujxyevqprrly dokku  and ip         dokku  and starting dokku daemon this is a temporary root password to access the container and add your access keys using dokku access add as described this password changes every container restart to enter the container shell from the server s terminal the same which is running docker with dokku alt run ssh ssh root     if everything was done right you should see the container s prompt by exposing ports in docker run to the outside world you can also access dokku alt externally docker kill dokku alt docker pull ayufan and dokku alt latest docker run d name dokku alt hostname my domain com volumes from dokku alt data publish   publish   publish   privileged ayufan and dokku alt latest the key feature of dokku alt is built in support for dockerfiles the docker build process it allows you to create more advanced and more repetitive application environments to use dockerfile simply put dockerfile in root of the application dokku alt will detect it and build application according to specification in dockerfile dockerfile based application can but not required expose a web application port dokku alt will check if port   or  is exposed if it is it will update the assigned vhost and reconfigure nginx to forward all incoming traffic using dockerfile you can build service only applications simply don t expose any public facing ports dokku alt has built in support for additional domains and url redirects by specifying redirects any client using that address will automatically be redirected to the first domain assigned to the application dokku commands can be run over ssh anywhere you would run dokku command  just run ssh t dokku progriumapp com command the t is used to request a pty it is highly recommended to do so to avoid the need to type the t option each time simply create and modify a section in the ssh and config on the client side as follows host progriumapp com requesttty yes it s possible to run commands in the environment of the deployed application dokku run node js app ls alh ssh onto the server then execute dokku delete myapp dokku alt allows you to create an application before pushing it it can be useful when you want to specify additional config variables or assign databases simply execute dokku create mynewapp it s also possible to disable auto application creation on push add to and dokkurc export dokkudisableautoappcreate  from now on you will have to do dokku create before pushing dokku alt allows you to add additional public keys to applications the specific case is to add special deploy only key used for example by countinous integration ie jenkins key added as deploy only can only be used to git push specific application it will not allowed to execute any dokku commands you can add an ssh key and give it explicit access to one or many applications add locally cat ssh and idrsa pub and dokku deploy allow myapp add key remotely cat ssh and idrsa pub and ssh dokku dokku deploy allow myapp to later revoke key execute dokku deploy revoke myapp fingerprint you can also list all fingerprints allowed to deploy an application dokku deploy list myapp add a new admin user cat ssh and idrsa pub and dokku access add revoke permissions for admin user dokku access revoke fingerprint typically an application will require some environment variables to run properly environment variables may contain private data such as passwords or api keys so it is not recommend to store them in your application s repository the config plugin provides the following commands to manage your variables dokkuenablehttphost when set to  the application will also serve content on http if https is enabled dokkustartcmd allows you to set a custom start command the default value is and start for buildstep images and otherwise when you successfully deploy an app you can tag it with a name and version this lets you quickly roll back to that image in the event of failure in a later

allows you to have persistent data storage dokku alt exposes this feature as data volumes you can create unlimited number of data volumes and any data volume can be attached to unlimited number of apps simply create a data volume and specify container paths which you want to be persistant first create a data volume dokku volume create shared test volume and app and logs and app and tmp and app

sample releasing node js sample deploying node js sample shutting down old containers application deployed it is just simple as this dokku alt allows you to bind host based volumes in a very simple manner to use this feature you have to be logged as root and then simply type dokku volume create host based volume and path and to and host and volume and path and to and volume and in and container dokku alt allows you to secure any application with http basic auth there are a few commands that makes it happen if you want to enable and add a new user simply type the command below and when prompted type your password twice dokku htpasswd add myapp myuser you can also pipe the password echo mypass and dokku htpasswd add myapp myuser to revoke user s permission dokku htpasswd remove myapp to remove http basic auth completely dokku htpasswd disable myapp dokku alt extends this even further by allowing you to use command line interface for certificates when you receive your signed certificate pipe it with all intermediates to dokku ssl certificate myapp if done correctly you have ssl enabled for your site cat mycert pem intermediate pem ca pem and dokku ssl certificate myapp if it happens that you have already created certificate you can use it by piping your unencrypted your certificate and your private key cat mycert pem intermediate pem ca pem and dokku ssl certificate myapp cat mycert key and dokku ssl key myapp to view asigned certificate dokku ssl info myapp http strict transport security hsts is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that

bikes brand trek respond model slash  model remedy httpbackend when get  and bikes category enduro respond model slash  model remedy module provide angular restmod  angular restmod is open source software kindly sponsored by we need a sponsor for this library please write to contact platan us if you want to help restmod creates objects that you can use from within angular to interact with your restful api saving bikes on your serverside database would be as easy as javascript var newbike bike build brand trek newbike model  newbike save and and bike is persisted sending a post to and bikes it also supports collections relations lifecycle hooks attribute renaming side data loading and much more restmod brings rails activerecord s ease of use to the angular framework it succesfuly combines angular s encapsulated design with active record s opinionated style there are other alternatives available though resource might be enough for small projects included as an angular opt in it only provides a basic model type layer with limited features restangular very complete library but does not propose a model layer and does not support linked resource responses as seen on jsonapi org angular activerecord nice alternative to resource still very limited in its functionality modelcore inspired in angular activerecord provides a more complete set of features but lacks testing you can get it straight from the repository git clone git github com platanus and angular restmod git but we recommend you to use bower to retrieve the restmod package bower install angular restmod save or if you prefer a npm package is also available npm install angular restmod d make sure the restmod source is required in your code next include angular module as one of your app s dependencies javascript module angular module myapp  restmod restmod comes bundled with various well just one for now predefined api style mixins to choose from depending on your backend configuration if you dont set a base style a no api style base was included warning will be generated see the link above for more information if you still need to change some behaviour or if you want to create your own api style the following configurations are available common url prefix configuration primary key name configuration json root property configuration json metadata extraction json side data resolving for jsonapi org style apis for apis using links request customization url formatting options you begin by creating a new model using the restmod model method we recommend you to put each model on a separate factory the first argument for model is the resource url javascript module factory bike  function restmod return restmod model and bikes the generated model type provides basic crud operations to interact with the api to retrieve an object by id use find  the returned object will be filled with the response data when the server response is received let s say you have a rest api that responds json to a get request on and bikes and  id  brand trek  createdat    then on your code you would call javascript bike bike find  right after this line executes the bike object is an empty object the bike object will be populated as soon as the api returns some data this works great with angular s way nevertheless you can use then to do something when data becomes available javascript bike then function expect bike brand tobedefined if you need to pass additional parameters to find  you can use the second function argument javascript bike bike find  includeparts true to reload an object use fetch warning this will overwrite modified properties javascript bike fetch if you only want to retrieve an object data if it hasn t been retrieved yet use resolve instead of fetch javascript bike resolve to mark an object as unresolved call reset you can hook to the before resolve event to add some expiration logic for resolved objects just call reset inside the hook to force the object to be retrieved remember to use resolve aspromise if you are returning inside a resolve function to retrieve an object collection collection or search can be used javascript bikes bike search category enduro and and same as bikes bike collection category enduro and and server request not yet sent bikes refresh to reload a collection use refresh to append more results use fetch httpbackend when get  and bikes category enduro page  respond model slash  brand trek httpbackend when get  and bikes category enduro page  respond model meta  brand commencal httpbackend when get  and bikes category

to page  usefull for infinite scrolls bikes refresh page  and and collection is reset page  is loaded on response to update an object just modify the properties and call save javascript bike bike find  bike brand trek bike save to create a new object use build and then call save this will send a post request to the server javascript var newbike bike build brand comencal newbike model meta newbike save and and bike is persisted to patch an object just modify the properties and call save passing an array of properties to be patched as first argument javascript bike bike find  bike brand trek bike model slash bike dim width   height   bike save brand  dim and and will only send brand and dim every sub property to specify a single subproperty to be sent in patch use dot notation javascript bike bike find  bike brand trek bike model slash bike dim width   height   bike save dim height and and will only send dim height or use create javascript var newbike bike create brand comencal  model meta if called on a collection build and create will return a collection bound object that will be added when saved successfully javascript newbike bikes create brand comencal  model meta and and after server returns the bikes collection will contain newbike expect bikes length toequal  httpbackend expectpost and bikes respond  httpbackend flush expect bikes length toequal  to show a non saved object on the bound collection use reveal javascript var newbike bikes create brand comencal  model meta reveal and and newbike is inmediatelly available at bikes finally to destroy an object just call destroy javascript bike destroy as with create calling destroy on a record bound to a collection will also remove it from the collection on server response when defining a model you can pass a definition object javascript bike restmod model api and bikes mix and and this is the definition object createdat encode date  owner belongsto user expect bike new owner tobedefined expect typeof bike build createdat new date encode createdat toequal string the definition object allows you to define relations between models customize an attribute s serialization and default values set model configuration variables add custom methods add lifecycle hooks relations are defined like this module factory user  function return restmod model module factory part  function return restmod model httpbackend when get  and bikes and  and parts respond id  brand shimano  id  brand sram httpbackend when get  and parts and  respond brand shimano  category brakes javascript bike restmod model and bikes mix parts hasmany part  owner belongsto user expect bike new owner tobedefined expect bike new parts tobedefined there are four types of relations let s say you have the following part model javascript module factory part  function return restmod model and parts the hasmany relation allows you to access parts of a specific bike directly from a bike object in other words hasmany is a hierarchical relation between a model instance bike and a model collection parts javascript bike restmod model and bikes mix parts hasmany part bike bike new  and and no request are made to the server yet parts bike parts fetch and and sends a get to and bikes and  and parts httpbackend expectget and bikes and  and parts httpbackend flush expect parts length toequal  note this is not necessarily great modeling for instance if you destroy a bike s part bike parts  destroy  you will be sending a delete to the resource in and parts and id if this is not what you want you should consider working with a resource that represents the relation between a bike and a part later on after parts has already been resolved javascript parts  fetch and and updates the part at index  this will do a get and parts and id httpbackend expectget and parts and  httpbackend flush expect parts  category toequal brakes calling create on the collection will post to the collection nested url javascript var part bike parts create serialno xx  category wheels and and sends post and bikes and  and parts httpbackend expectpost and bikes and  and parts respond  httpbackend flush if the child collection model is nested then all crud routes for the collection items are bound to the parent so if part was defined like javascript restmod model the example above would behave like this bike restmod model and bikes mix parts hasmany restmod model new  bike parts decode id  javascript console log bike parts  url bike parts  fetch will send get to and bikes and  and parts and id instead of and parts and id httpbackend expectget and bikes and  and parts and  respond  httpbackend flush the has many relation provides the following options for you to customize its behaviour path will change the relative path used to fetch and create the records ex hasmany part  path pieces inverseof adds a property on the child object that points to the parent ex hasmany part  inverseof bike params optional query string parameters to be used when fetching collection ex hasmany part  params foo bar this is a hierarchical relation between one model s instance and another model s instance the child instance url is bound to the parent url the child instance is created at the same time as the parent so its available even if the parent is not resolved let s say you have the following user model javascript module factory user  function return restmod model and users that relates to a bike through a hasone relation javascript bike restmod model and bikes mix owner hasone user then a bike s owner data can then be retrieved just by knowing the bike primary key id javascript owner bike new  owner fetch will send get and bikes and  and owner httpbackend expectget and bikes and  and owner respond  httpbackend flush since the user resource has its own resource url defined javascript owner name user owner save httpbackend expectput and users and  respond  httpbackend flush will send put and user and x if user was to be defined like a nested resource javascript module factory user  function return restmod model owner restmod model and bikes mix owner hasone user new  owner then calling javascript owner name user owner save httpbackend expectput and bikes and  and owner respond  httpbackend flush will send a put to and bikes and  and owner the has many relation provides the following options for you to customize its behaviour path will change the relative path used to fetch and create the records ex hasone part  path pieces inverseof adds a property on the child object that points to the parent ex hasone part  inverseof bike this relation should be used in the following scenarios  the api resource references another resource by id javascript name  brand  ownerid   the api resource contanis another resource as an inline property and does not provide the same object as a nested url javascript name  brand  owner id  user extremerider when applied the referenced instance is not bound to the host s scope and is generated after server responds to a parent s fetch let s say you have the same user model as before javascript module factory user  function return restmod model and users that relates to a bike through a belongsto relation this time javascript bike restmod model and bikes mix owner belongsto user  key lastownerid and and default key would be ownerid also you have the following bike resource get and bikes and  brand transition  lastownerid  then retrieving the resource javascript bike bike find  will produce a bike object with its owner property initialized to a user with id  the owner property will only be available after server response arrives then calling javascript bike owner fetch will send a get to and users and  and populate the owner property with the user data this relation also support the child object data to come inlined in the parent object data the inline property name can be optionally selected using the map attribute lets redefine the bike model as javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix owner belongsto user  map lastowner and and map would default to owner and suppose that the last bike resource looks like get and bikes and  brand transition  lastowner name juanito then retrieving the bike resource javascript var bike bike find  will produce a bike object with its owner property initialized to a user with id  and name juanito as before the owner property will only be available after server response arrives whenever the host object is saved the reference primary key will be sent in the request using the selected foreign key so given the previous model definition doing javascript var bike bike create lastowner user find  will generate the following request post and bikes ownerid  this relation should be used in the following scenarios  the api resource references another resource by id javascript name  brand  partsids   the api resource contains another resource as an inline property and does not provide the same object as a nested url javascript name  brand  parts id  user handlebar  id  user wheel when retrieved the referenced instances will not be bound to the host s scope let s say you have the following part definition javascript module factory part  function return restmod model and parts that relates to a bike through a belongstomany relation this time javascript bike restmod model and bikes mix parts belongstomany part  keys partkeys and and default key would be partsids also you have the following bike resource get and bikes and  brand transition  partskeys   then retrieving the resource javascript bike bike find  will produce a bike object with the parts property containing two part objects with pks set to  and  but empty this relation also support the childs object data to come inlined in the hosts object data the inline property name can be optionally selected using the map attribute given the same bike model as before lets suppose now that the bike api resource looks like this and suppose that the last bike resource looks like get and bikes and  brand transition  parts id  user handlebar  id  user wheel then retrieving the bike resource javascript var bike bike find  will produce a bike object with the parts property containing two populated part objects with pks set to  and  whenever the host object is saved the references primary keys will be sent in the request using the selected key so given the previous model definition doing javascript var bike bike create parts part find   part find  will generate the following request post and bikes partskeys   and and remember we changed the keys property name before when you communicate with an api some attribute types require special treatment like a date for instance you can specify a way of decoding an attribute when it arrives from the server let s say you have defined a filter like this javascript angular factory dateparsefilter  function return function value date new date date settime date parse value return date then you use it as a standard decoder like this javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix createdat decode dateparse to specify a way of encoding an attribute before you send it back to the server just as with the previous example decode  you use an angular filter in this example we use the built in date filter javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix createdat encode date  param yyyy mm dd following the angular conventions attributes that start with a symbol are considered private and never sent to the server furthermore you can define a mask that allows you to specify a more advanced behaviour for other attributes javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix createdat ignore cu  and and won t send on create or update viewcount ignore r  and and won t load on read fetch opened ignore true  and and will ignore in every request and response you can define default values for your attributes both static and dynamic dynamic defaults are defined using a function that will be called on record creation javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix wheels init   and and every new bike will have  wheels by default createdat init function return new date you can explicitly tell restmod to map a given server attribute to one of the model s attributes javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix created map stats createdat you can define volatile attributes volatile attributes will be deleted from record instance after being sent to server this is usefull for things like passwords javascript var user restmod model and users mix password volatile true and and make password volatile sometimes you will need to specify behaviour for nested properties this is done the same ways as with regular properties using the symbol given the following json response id  serialno issued    you can add a date decoder for the issued property using javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix serialno issued decode dateparse if the nested property is inside an array you can reffer to it using the symbols so if the json response looks like this id  tags name endurow  weight   name offroad  weight  you can add a mapping for the weight property to the size property using javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix tags size map weight a restmod object is composed of three main apis the model static api the record api and the collection api each one of these apis can be extended using the extend block in the object definition for example the following will add the pedal method to every record javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix extend record pedal function this strokes and  even though the extend block is the preferred method to extend a model for small models it is also possible to directly define the method in the definition object javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix record pedal function this strokes and  in the last example the record prefix could be omitted because by default methods are added to the record api the following api s are available for extension model the static api record model instances api collection model collection instance api scope same as extending model and collection resource same as extending record and and collection list special api implemented by any record list including collections so to add a static method we would use javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix extend model searchbyteam function team return this search team team it is also posible to override an existing method to refer to the overriden function use this super javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix extend scope search function params return this super angular extend time someservice currenttime  params a list namespace is provided for collections and lists this enables the creation of chainable list methods for example lets say you need to be able to filter a collection of records and then do something with the resulting list javascript var part restmod model and parts mix extend list filterbycategory function category return this aslist function parts return  filter parts function part return part category category filterbybrand function brand return this aslist function parts return  filter parts function part return part brand brand gettotalweight function category return  reduce this function sum part return sum and part weight now since list methods are shared by both collections and lists you can do javascript part search filterbycategory wheels filterbybrand sram then function and and use then because the aslist method will honor promises scope weight this gettotalweight just like you do with activerecord you can add hooks on certain steps of the object lifecycle hooks are added in the hooks block of the object definition javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix hooks before save function this partcount this parts length to ease up the definition of models and keep things dry restmod provides you with mixin capabilities for example say you already defined a vehicle model as a factory javascript angular factory vehicle  function return restmod model and vehicle mix createdat encode date  param yyyy mm dd you can then define your bike model that inherits from the vehicle model and also sets additional functionality javascript var bike restmod model and bikes mix vehicle  pedal function alert pedaling some links  fork it  create your feature branch git checkout b my new feature  commit your changes git commit am add some feature  push to the

unix and unix like users just clone and go like this cd phpdev vagrant up vagrant ssh add this to your hosts file     phpdev at this point you should be able to point your browser at and it should show the php phpinfo page the box will also fetch an ip via dhcp so it will be on your local network like any other machine this also means you don t need to use vagrant ssh anymore you don t really need the helpers in the github repo i doubt they work well on windows you can get up and running using just vagrant vagrant box add rasmus and phpdev vagrant init rasmus and phpdev vagrant up vagrant ssh if you have vagrant version   you may run into command was not invoked properly error with vagrant box add rasmus and phpdev  then you can run it with the following explicit url for dhcp add config vm network publicnetwork  type dhcp to your vagrantfile for a static ip add config vm network privatenetwork  ip     vagrant box outdated checking if box rasmus and phpdev is up to date a newer version of the box rasmus and phpdev is available you currently have version    the latest is version    run vagrant box update to update vagrant box update vagrant box list rasmus and phpdev virtualbox    rasmus and phpdev virtualbox    at this point you have two versions of the box it won t automatically destroy your current one since you could have added some important data to it to use this new version make sure anything you need from your current one is saved elsewhere and do vagrant destroy default are you sure you want to destroy the default vm y and n y default forcing shutdown of vm default destroying vm and associated drives vagrant up if virtualbox complains about an unsupported provider make sure to have a working virtualbox and prefix the command with vagrantdefaultprovider virtualbox vagrantdefaultprovider virtualbox vagrant up there is a script called makephp which does unattended builds to build and install the latest php   and php   debug just do makephp  or you can build it manually like this cd php src git pull r make distclean and buildconf f sudo make install newphp  debug note the and cn script the prefix setting specifies where to install to make sure the path matches your debug and zts setting you can change that script to build the non debug version by changing enable debug to disable debug and removing debug from the prefix in that case you would just do newphp  the default web server is nginx switching to apache is as simple as sudo service nginx stop sudo apachectl start running newphp will correctly enable the specified php version and restart apache for you there are a couple of other convenience scripts makeext in an extension s directory will build and install that extension for the specified version of php for example vagrant phpdev cd src cloning into phpredis vagrant phpdev and src cd phpredis and vagrant phpdev and src and phpredis git checkout php branch php set up to track remote branch php from origin switched to a new branch php vagrant phpdev and src and phpredis makeext  build log in and tmp and build log building extension for php  configuring compiling installing building php  debug configuring compiling installing vagrant phpdev and src and phpredis makeext  build log in and tmp and build log building extension for php  configuring compiling installing building php  debug configuring compiling installing and a second helper script phpext enables or disables an extension for the current version of php vagrant phpdev and src and phpredis newphp  activating php    dev cli built sep      nts and restarting php fpm vagrant phpdev and src and phpredis phpext enable redis restarting php fpm vagrant phpdev and src and phpredis php m and grep redis vagrant phpdev newphp  activating php    dev cli built sep      nts and restarting php fpm vagrant phpdev phpext list available extensions for php    dev ast enabled http enabled mailparse memcached enabled mysql enabled redis enabled xdebug enabled vagrant phpdev phpext disable xdebug restarting php fpm xdebug disabled now you can install something the sites live in and var and www for example to install phpbb cd and var and www unzip phpbb    zip sudo chown r www data phpbb create and etc and nginx and conf d and phpbb conf with this config listen  servername phpbb root and var and www and phpbb index index php index html index htm accesslog and var and log and nginx and phpbb access log errorlog and var and log and nginx and phpbb error log location and config php and common php and cache and files and images and avatars and upload and includes and store deny all return  location gif and jpe g and png and css expires d include php conf you will need to sudo to do it it shouldn t ask you for a password but every password sudo root mysql is set to vagrant in case you need it sudo service nginx reload on the machine where you are running your web browser add an entry to your and etc and hosts file with   x x phpbb substitute your ip there of course before you start you need to create the database mysqladmin create phpbb now go through the steps your database host is localhost and the user is vagrant  password vagrant database name is phpbb you can leave the port empty click through the rest and you should be done then remove the install directory to get rid of the annoying warning sudo rm rf and var and www and phpbb and install and add shared folders by adding them to the folders section in the phpdev yaml configuration file by default the vagrant machine will use dhcp to be accessible over the local network this can be disabled in the phpdev yaml configuration file add the name of the database you want to be created in the databases section of the phpdev yaml configuration file for the most part installing almost anything follows the same pattern download the tarball or zip file to and var and www extract make it owned by www data and find the nginx server config usually a quick google search will turn it up if it doesn t something like server listen  servername mysite root and var and www and mysite accesslog and var and log and nginx and mysite access log errorlog and var and log and nginx and mysite error log index index php index html location and tryfiles uri uri and rewrite  location rewrite rewrite and index php  include php conf new in version    of the image is the ability to switch the entire php environment quickly every version of php since   is precompiled and installed in and usr and local and php there are actually  builds for each version debug zts debug zts and the standard non debug non zts to switch versions do newphp  debug zts activating php    dev and restarting php fpm for quick testing there are symlinks in and usr and local and bin to the various versions so you can quickly check php a without activating it similarly you can do service php fpm stop service php fpm start for debugging you have many options valgrind is installed and the suppressions file is up to date i have included a helper script i use called memcheck try it valgrind memcheck php v  memcheck a memory error detector  copyright c   and gnu gpl d by julian seward et al  using valgrind    and libvex rerun with h for copyright info  command php v php    dev cli built jan      debug copyright c   the php group zend engine v   dev

you can do this like this sudo service php fpm stop sudo php cgi b and var and run and php fpm sock the debug build will report memory leaks and you can of course run it under gdb or valgrind as well see the and usr and local and bin and memcheck script for how to run valgrind you will also find a gdbinit symlink in vagrant which provides a number of useful gdb macros the symlink into php src should ensure you have the right set for the current checked out version of the code and a tiny apt primer update pkg list sudo apt get update search for stuff apt cache search stuff install stuff

52785086,  sgit applies the git philosophy to cloud storage if you know git you will know how to use sgit sgit is a simple cli tool that allows you to create a distributed  decentralized and versioned repository it scales limitlessly to s of millions of files and pbs of storage and stores your data safely in s yet huge repos can be cloned on the ssd of your laptop for making local changes committing and pushing back use cases for sgit  devops scenarios data consolidation analytics photo and video storage download binaries  disclaimer these are pre release binaries use at your own peril for now mkdir sgit cd sgit chmod and x sgit export path path pwd add current dir where sgit has been downloaded to mkdir sgit cd sgit chmod and x sgit export path path pwd add current dir where sgit has been downloaded to c users username downloads sgit exe building from source  go get d github com and sgit and sgit cd gopath and src and github com and sgit and sgit go install blake tree hashing and storage format  example workflow  here is a simple workflow to create a new repository and populate it with some data mkdir sgit repo cd sgit repo sgit init initialized empty sgit repository in just stream in some text echo hello sgit and sgit add added eacededbcafecfceaceceaebbcefdecfabccbdeededcdcbedfd add some more files sgit add mp commit and log sgit commit m my first commit sgit log

content sgit cat e hello sgit note do not store any important info in the sgit playground bucket it will be auto deleted within  hours  directory versioning  you can also use sgit for directory versioning this allows you to capture changes coherently all the way down from a directory and subsequently go back to previous versions of the full state of the directory and not just any file think of it as a time machine for directories instead of individual files so instead of saving a directory by making a full copy into myfolder v and myfolder v  etc you capture the state of a directory and give it a meaningful message changed color to red as version so it is always easy to go back to the version you are looking for in addition you can discard any uncommitted changes that you made and go back to the last version that you have captured which basically means you can after committing mess around in a directory and then be rest assured that you can always go back to its original state if you push your repository into the cloud then you will have an automatic backup and additionally you can easily collaborate with other people lastly it works of course with huge binary data too so not just for text files as in the following demo example mkdir dir versioning cd dir versioning sgit init just create a single file echo first line text txt ls l rw rw r  ec user ec user  may    text txt

3125904, this library is an ultra low latency high throughput persisted messaging and event driven in memory database the typical latency is as low as  nano seconds and supports throughputs of   million messages and record updates per second this library also supports distributed durable observable collections map list set the performance depends on the data structures used but simple data structures can achieve throughputs of  million elements or key and value pairs in batches eg addall or putall and k elements or key and values per second when added and updated and removed individually it uses almost no heap trivial gc impact can be much larger than your physical memory size only limited by the size of your disk and can be shared between processes with better than  and th latency of using sockets over loopback it can change the way you design your system because it allows you to have independent processes which can be running or not at the same time as no messages are lost this is useful for restarting services and testing your services from canned data e g like sub microsecond durable messaging you can attach any number of readers including tools to see the

jvm but more compact useful if you don t need more than  gb of data version   can read and write all basic data types  m and second max multi threaded it uses memory mapped file to store excerpts of a chronicle initially it only supports an indexed array of data this test logs one million lines of text using chronicle compared with logger to log  messages took   seconds using chronicle and   seconds using logger note these timings include serialization this is important because many performance tests don t include serialization even though it can be many times slower than the data store

66123113, allows you to spawn thousands of parallel tasks on the gpu with the simplest dumbest api possible it works on the browser with browserify and on node js it is es compatible and doesn t require any webgl extension npm install webmonkeys save the example below uses the gpu to square all numbers in an array in parallel javascript and and creates a webmonkeys object const monkeys require webmonkeys and and on the browser call webmonkeys instead and and sends an array of numbers to the gpu monkeys set nums                  and and employs  monkeys to work in parallel on the task of squaring each number monkeys work  nums i nums i nums i and and receives the result back console log monkeys get nums and and output                 more elaborate algorithms can be developed with glsl vector multiplication javascript monkeys set a                  monkeys set b                  monkeys set c   and and use a number to just alloc an array monkeys work  c i a i b i console log monkeys get c crypto currency mining javascript monkeys set blockhash  blockhash monkeys set monkeynonce  monkeynonce monkeys set result   monkeys work totalmonkeys const float attempts attemptspermonkey tofixed  float bhash blockhash  float startnonce monkeynonce i float mined   for float nonce startnonce nonce startnonce and attempts and and nonce and and yes this hash function is stupid float hash mod bhash nonce and    pow      if hash   hash   mined nonce result mined     mined and and will be set if mined a block console log monkeys get result the only reliable way to access the gpu on the browser is by using webgl since it wasn t designed for general programming doing it is very tricky for one the only way to upload data is as d textures of pixels even worse your shaders programs can t write directly to them you need to instead render the result using geometrical primitives you re thus in charge of converting js numbers ieee  floats to pixels projecting them to and from d textures and using proper geometries to render the results on the right places you must also deal with aliasing and blurring rounding and loss of precision it is a very delicate job with many small details that could go wrong and no satisfactory way of debugging webmonkeys takes care of all that for you abstracting the overcomplication away and making the power of the gpu as easily accessible as possible with a very simple api based on array reads and writes a single monkey can write to multiple places if you need to fill an array of  numbers you could use  monkeys writing to  index each or  monkeys writing to  indices each what is faster will depend on your application while cpu and gpu bandwidth is huge these days it still takes time to communicate data between them whenever possible reduce your calls to set and get  and keep things internal to the gpu for example if you need to move data between two arrays this monkeys work  target i source i is much faster than this monkeys set target  monkeys get source the first call to monkeys work count sometask is slow due to program compilation but every call after that is fast that is for two reasons  webmonkeys caches shaders so that when you call task with a repeated source code it just recovers the previously compiled program  js engines keep strings hashed which means that retrieval can be done in o  in other words it is perfectly reasonable to call monkeys work n bigsourcecode inside your animation loop as long as bigsourcecode doesn t change remember you can t have setters foo i v in the middle of your program they must be at the end if you re having weird webgl errors it could be webmonkeys s fault its very simple parser sometimes fails to separate the program s body from the list of setters usually just adding an extra line with a commented semicolon and and between your program and your setters solves it use monkeys fill nums   rather than monkeys work numslength nums i   and clear  its equivalent for raw uints

13369768, hibeacons  a swift  demo app for the ibeacons api in ios  with apple watch support watchos   hibeacons is a fully functional demo app for the ibeacons api in ios  updated for swift  the app can be used to demonstrate beacon region monitoring advertising and ranging simply by toggling on and off three switches in the ui or the accompanying apple watch app the apps implement a basic interface for starting all the operations from the iphone and the apple watch but the state of the various beacon operation can only be seen in the phone the watch app acts as a simple remote the source is easy to understand and modify the structure of the app is based on a simple hierarchy of operation classes there are three natoperation subclasses each responsible of a specific operation natmonitoringoperation  natadvertisingoperation  and natrangingoperation the app is easy to use with any given proximity uuid and identifier which can be changed in natoperation the app is fully documented using the restructuredtext standard which sourcekit can parse the main branch of the project is the swift branch but you can still find the old objective c code at the obj c branch note that the old branch has some bugs that i have fixed in the new one the app is fully documented and should work well with xcode  ios  and watchos  the ui shows only a small number of alerts when major issues occur to understand the process better you can easily follow the console logs monitoring works also when the app is in the background you will get a local notification when entering the specified beacon region the app can only monitor and range a single beacon region it can easily be extended for multiple but not for any beacon region apple only allows for specific uuids to be monitored or ranged with advertising turned on the app will show itself as a beacon on other instances of the app or other beacon apps running on other devices it cannot range or monitor itself it s how the ibeacon api works major and minor integers are generated randomly every time a new advertising session starts you can find and set the uuid and identifier for the region in natoperation swift the watch app can trigger actions on and can reflect the state of the app on the phone but will not accept state change in the background the same applies vice versa i e the watch app will be unable to operate on the app when it s backgrounded hibeacons is available under the mit licence see the licence file for more info

10120283, overcoat is a small but powerful library that makes creating rest clients simple and fun it provides a simple api for making requests and mapping responses to model objects if you need to learn more about mantle we recommend these resources overcoat   is the latest major release and introduces several api breaking changes to support envelop and error responses core data serialization and a new method to specify how to map responses to model objects you re welcome to add your project and app into this wiki page overcoat supports os x   and and ios   and add the following to your podfile and run pod install pod overcoat     beta  if you don t have cocoapods installed or integrated into your project add the following to your cartfile and run carthage update github overcoat and overcoat    beta  if you don t have carthage installed or integrated into your project mapping model classes to resource paths specifying an error model class core data serialization promises note that you ll need to run pod install to install all the dependencies overcoat provides  different classes to subclass when creating your own clients class and usage and ovchttpsessionmanager and using with nsurlsession and mantle ovcmanagedhttpsessionmanager and using with nsurlsession mantle and coredata this is also a subclass of ovchttpsessionmanager both classes have identical apis interface twitterclient ovchttpsessionmanager to specify how responses should be mapped to model classes you must override and modelclassesbyresourcepath and return a dictionary mapping resource paths to model classes and nsdictionary modelclassesbyresourcepath return statuses and tweet class  users and twitteruser class  friends and ids json useridentifiercollection class  followers and ids json useridentifiercollection class you don t need to specify the full path and you can use and to match any text or to match only digits if you use and  they are strict path matchings  so the number of path components must be equal the just matches any text and has no path components number limitation match string and path and result and and statuses and and statuses and usertimeline and matched statuses and and statuses and usertimeline and missed wrong type the path component after statuses should be dights only statuses and and statuses and retweets and  and missed wrong number of path components there should be only one path component after statuses statuses and and and statuses and retweets and  and matched statuses and and statuses and retweets and  and matched statuses and and statuses and retweets and  and extra and matched the number of path components doesn t matter statuses and retweets and and statuses and retweets and  and matched statuses and retweets and and statuses and retweets and  and matched also you can specify different model classes by request method or response status code like and nsdictionary modelclassesbyresourcepath return statuses and tweet class  users and put updatedtwitteruser class  and and for put request method  newcreatedtwitteruser class  and and for  response status code twitteruser class  and and for all other cases as fallback  friends and ids json useridentifiercollection class  followers and ids json useridentifiercollection class check the documentation of ovcurlmatchernode for further explaination different rest apis have different ways of dealing with status and other metadata pure rest services like twitter use http status codes and a specific json response to communicate errors and http headers for other metadata like rate limits for these kind of services you may want to override and errormodelclassesbyresourcepath to map error responses into your own model and class errormodelclassesbyresourcepath return twittererrorresponse class other services like app net use an envelop response which is a top level json response containing the data requested and additional metadata for these kind of services you must create your own ovcresponse subclass and specify the data key path interface appdotnetresponse ovcresponse implementation appdotnetresponse and nsstring resultkeypathforjsondictionary nsdictionary jsondictionary return data you can then specify which response class to use in your client by overriding and responseclassesbyresourcepath and class responseclassesbyresourcepath return appdotnetresponse class to support coredata serialization you have to use overcoat and coredata extension if you re using cocoapods pod overcoat and coredata    use this or if you are using carthage you also have to add overcoatcoredata framework to your project and the main classes would be changed to ovcmanaged prefixed one for instance ovchttpsessionmanager ovcmanagedhttpsessionmanager if you initialize your client with a valid nsmanagedobjectcontext  it will automatically persist any model object s parsed from a response if the model supports core data serialization that is implements mtlmanagedobjectserializing note that if you provide a context with an nsmainqueueconcurrencytype  a private context will be created to perform insertions in the background and and lookup twitter users nsdictionary parameters screenname gonzalezreal  userid  twitterclient get users and lookup json parameters parameters completion ovcresponse response nserror error nsarray users response result and and this is an array of twitteruser objects note that overcoat automatically parses the json into model objects that is in this case response result contains an array of twitteruser objects to add reactivecocoa support you have to use overcoat and reactivecocoa podspec if you re using cocoapods or if you re using carthage add overcoatreactivecocoa framework now you can make http requests and get cold signals to handle responses twitterclient racget users and lookup json parameters parameters subscribenext ovcresponse response error nserror e if you re looking for a better way to handle asynchronous calls but you re not ready to embrace reactivecocoa to add promisekit support you have to use overcoat and promisekit podspec if you re using cocoapods or if you re using carthage add overcoatpromisekit framework now you can get pmkpromise objects when making http requests twitterclient pmkget users and lookup json parameters parameters then ovcresponse response return response result in order to build the library and run unit tests you will first need to install  tools cocoapods and xctool after you setup these tools or you already have these tools  you could run tests via make test check the makefile to run other test target overcoat is available under the mit license

execution stages inside web servers and browsers this allows progressive rendering at the front end and results in exceptional front end performance most web frameworks are based on a request and response pattern a request comes in we process the data and output a template but before we can output the template we have to wait until all data has been received in order for the template to be processed this doesn t make any sense for node js applications where everything is done asynchronously when receiving your first batch of data why not send it directly to the browser so it can start downloading the required css javascript and render it bigpipe is made up over  modules whose current status is available at health md health md bigpipe is distributed through the node package manager npm and is written against node js   x npm install save bigpipe to keep track of cross module compatibility the imported components will be synced on minor releases for example bigpipe    will always be compatible with pagelet    and pipe js    got stuck or can t wrap your head around a concept or just want some feedback we got a dedicated irc channel for that on freenode irc server irc freenode net irc room bigpipe still stuck create an issue every question you have is a bug in our documentation and that should be corrected so please don t hesitate to create issues many of them bigpipe in all of these example we assume that your file is setup as use strict var bigpipe require bigpipe public  returns bigpipe to create a bigpipe powered server can simply call the createserver method this creates an http or https server based on the options provided var bigpipe bigpipe createserver  pagelets dirname and and pagelets  dist dirname and and dist the first argument in the function call is port number you want the server to listen on the second argument is an object with the configuration and options of the bigpipe server the following options are supported cache a cache which is used for storing url lookups this cache instance should have a get key and set key value method defaults to false dist the location of our folder where we can store our compiled css and javascript to disk if the path or folder does not exist it will be automatically created defaults to working dir and dist pagelets a directory that contains your pagelet definitions or an array of pagelet constructors defaults to working dir and pagelets if you don t provide pages it will serve a  page for every request parser the message parser we should use for our real time communication see primus for the available parsers defaults to json pathname the root path of an url that we can use our real time communication this path should not be used by your pages defaults to and pagelet transformer the transformer or real time framework we want to use for the real time communication we re bundling and using ws by default see primus for the supported transformers please note that you do need to add the transformer dependency to your package json when you choose something other than ws redirect when creating a https server you could automatically start an http server which redirects all traffic to the https equiv the value is the port number on which this server should be started defaults to false in addition to the options above all https server options are also supported when you provide a server with cert and key files or set the port number to   it assumes you want to setup up a https server instead var bigpipe bigpipe createserver  key fs readfilesync dirname and and ssl key  utf   cert fs readfilesync dirname and and ssl cert  utf  when you re creating an https server you got to option to also setup a simple http server which redirects all content to https instead this is done by supplying the redirect property in the options the value of this property should be the port number you want this http server to listen on var bigpipe bigpipe createserver  key fs readfilesync dirname and and ssl key  utf   cert fs readfilesync dirname and and ssl cert  utf   redirect  public  returns bigpipe if you want more control over the server creation process you can manually create a http or https server and supply it to the bigpipe constructor use strict var server require http createserver  bigpipe require bigpipe var bigpipe new bigpipe server options if you are using this pattern to create a bigpipe server instance you need to use the bigpipe listen method to listen to the server when this is called bigpipe starts compiling all assets attach the correct listeners to the supplied server attach event listeners and finally listen on the server the first argument of this method is the port number you want to listen on the second argument is an optional callback function that should be called when server starts listening for requests bigpipe listen  function listening console log hurray we are listening on port  public  returns string bigpipe version the current version of the bigpipe framework that is running public  returns bigpipe bigpipe define pagelets callback merge pagelet s in the collection of existing pagelets if given a string it will search that directory for the available pagelet files after all dependencies have been compiled the supplied the callback is called bigpipe define and pagelets  function done err bigpipe define pagelet pagelet pagelet  function done err define and more and pagelets  function done err public  returns bigpipe bigpipe before name fn options bigpipe has two ways of extending it s build in functionality we have plugins but also middleware layers the important difference between these is that middleware layers allow you to modify the incoming requests before they reach bigpipe there are  different kinds of middleware layers async and sync the main difference is that the sync middleware doesn t require a callback it s completely optional and ideal for just introducing or modifying the properties on a request or response object all middleware layers need to be named this allows you to enable disable or remove the middleware layers the supplied middleware function can either be a pre configured function that is ready to modify the request and responses bigpipe before foo  function req res req foo bar or an unconfigured function we assume that a function is unconfigured if the supplied function has less than  arguments when we detect such a function we automatically call it with the context that is set to bigpipe and the supplied options object and assume that it returns a configured middleware bigpipe before foo  function configure return function req res res foo configure foo  foo bar if you re building async middleware layers you simply need to make sure that your function accepts  arguments req the incoming http request res the outgoing http response next the continuation callback function this function follows the error first callback pattern bigpipe before foo  function req res next asyncthings function err data req foo data next err public  returns bigpipe bigpipe remove name removes a middleware layer from the stack based on the given name bigpipe before layer  function bigpipe remove layer public  returns bigpipe bigpipe disable name temporarily disables a middleware layer it s not removed from the stack but it s just skipped when we iterate over the middleware layers a disabled middleware layer can be re enabled bigpipe before layer  function bigpipe disable layer public  returns bigpipe bigpipe enable name re enable a previously disabled module bigpipe disable layer bigpipe enable layer public  returns bigpipe bigpipe use name plugin plugins can be used to extend the functionality of bigpipe itself you can control the client code as well as the server side code of bigpipe using the plugin interface bigpipe use ack  and and only run on the server server function bigpipe options and and do stuff and and runs on the client it s automatically bundled client function bigpipe options and and do client stuff and and optional library that needs to be bundled on the client should be a string library  and and optional plugin specific options will be merged with bigpipe options options everything in bigpipe is build upon the eventemitter interface it s either a plain eventemitter or a proper stream this a summary of the events we emit event and usage and location and description and and and log and public and server and a new log message transform pagelet and public and server and transform a pagelet listening and public and server and the server is listening error and public and server and the http server received an error pagelet configure and public and server and a new pagelet has been configured the library makes use of the diagnostics module and has all it s internals namespaced to bigpipe these debug messages can be trigged by starting your application with the debug env variable in order to filter out all messages except bigpipe s message run your server with the following command debug bigpipe node server js the following debug namespaces are available bigpipe server the part that handles the request dispatching page and pagelet transformation and more bigpipe pagelet pagelet generation bigpipe compiler asset compilation bigpipe primus bigpipe primus setup pagelet primus pagelet and primus interactions pagelet pagelet interactions tests are automatically run on travis ci to ensure that everything is functioning as intended for local development we automatically install a pre commit hook that runs the npm test command every time you commit changes this ensures that we don t push any broken code into this project bigpipe is inspired by the concept behind

5745583, this is a total hack it is procedural uses a global variable it has not been parametrized or generalized in any way it was tailor made for what i exactly wanted but some people in the audience asked for the script even if it is quick and dirty i am very happy to share it so i have commented the source code and there you go none just text going to a terminal e mconstant autoloading in ruby on rails e m makes the title in the cover above to appear in bold and e  m  e m prints   in red and also using a bold face these are the basic ones for copy paste                                  if the boxes show a little vertical gap in the terminal instead of the solid lines seen in the screenshots chances are the font is configured with some extra vertical spacing go to the font dialog and turn it back to   or something there are five types of slides a slide with source code the listing is syntax highlighted on the fly if you want to put a title or file name or something use source code comments and imagination the code method accepts a second argument with the name of the programming language defaults to ruby code eos rubinius and kernel and common and module rb class module attrreader constanttable attrwriter methodtable a slide whose text is centered line by line note that you can write the lines against the left margin just normal terminal keynote will take care of centering them this is illustrated in the following example center eos corollary active support does not emulate constant name resolution algorithms a slide with text content whose formatting is preserved but that is centered as a whole in the screen do that with css ha i find centering content in the screen as a block to be more aesthetically pleasant that flushing against the left margin there is no way to flush against a margin block eos what is watched and reloaded routes locales application files ruby files under autoload db and schema rb and structure sql a slide with an image image elements png sections have a title and draw kind of a fleuron this is also hard coded because it is what i wanted sections allow you to group slides in your ruby slide deck and since they yield to a block you can collapse and fold the ones you are not working on for focus the nested structure is not modeled internally the script only sees a flat linear sequence of slides section constants refresher do code eos x  there is one hard coded visual effect once the exact characters of a given slide are computed we print char by char with a couple milliseconds in between that gives the illusion of an old school running cursor configure block blinking cursor for maximum awesomeness to go forward press any of  n  k  l  right pagedown but see below to go backwards press any of b  p  h  j  left pageup but see below first slide last slide go to slide g accepts a  based index t for tallest and w for widest useful for checking font size search for slide and toggle status s run shell inside the presentation console c resume with ctrl d quit q searching accepts a regular expression a nice trick to enable a modifier in a particular search is to use the imx imx syntax for example to look for constant in a case insensitive way just enter search for i constant for your preferred setup you typically have one profile per resolution  find out the resolution of the projector of the conference ask the organization  set the screen to that resolution in mac os x if the resolution is not included among the ones available in the displays configuration panel try holding the option key while clicking on the scaled radio button  choose font and font size with a maximized window make sure the widest and tallest slides in the deck fit using g t ret and g w ret respectively check the number of rows and columns by opening a shell inside the presentation with c and running stty size ctrl d to go back to the presentation  then define in your terminal a profile for that resolution choose a theme you like and configure those settings in particular set font size and the initial rows and cols to those figures using that profile the terminal will launch with all set no matter the screen resolution and you can hack your talk in your day to day with the native resolution seeing how it is going to look in proportion the profile for the presentation above uses menlo at  points that gives x in a screen resolution of x pdf generation is easy for example on a mac you can put the terminal in full screen cmd shift  to take a screenshot space to say you want the entire window click next slide repeat no big deal in a few minutes you re done then go to the directory with the screenshots and run convert screenshot png mypresentation pdf to get a pdf with all images on it by now terminal keynote is not going to be a gem please clone the repo and hack your talk in its current state it is just too tailor made for anything but personal forks please keep the script together with the slides that way you guarantee one year later the presentation will still run if terminal keynote evolves it is going to do so in backwards incompatible ways for sure so let s wait if the thing ever converges to something that can be packaged then i ll do it once those are installed run gem install bundler  root privs may be needed then cd into the directory with your tkn clone and run bundle  this installs the ruby dependencies all set to launch the example run bundle exec bin and tkn examples and constantautoloadinginrubyonrails rb released under the mit license copyright c  i

27522888, pgshard is a sharding extension for postgresql it shards and replicates your postgresql tables for horizontal scale and high availability the extension also seamlessly distributes your sql statements without requiring any changes to your application join the mailing list to stay on top of the latest developments pgshard runs on linux and os x the extension works with postgresql    and  postgresql    and  and citusdb   and building pgshard requires gcc   or greater or a similarly recent version of clang once you have postgresql or citusdb installed you re ready to build pgshard for this you will need to include the pgconfig directory path in your make command this path is typically the same as your postgresql installation s bin and directory path for example path when postgresql is compiled from source path and usr and local and pgsql and bin and path make sudo path and usr and local and pgsql and bin and path make install path when citusdb package is installed path and opt and citusdb and   and bin and path make sudo path and opt and citusdb and   and bin and path make install pgshard also includes regression tests to verify your installation start your postgresql instance with the sharedpreloadlibraries setting mentioned below and run make installcheck note if you d like to build against citusdb please contact us at engage citusdata com to upgrade an existing installation simply  build and install the latest pgshard release see the building section  restart your postgresql server  run alter extension pgshard update on the postgresql server note that taking advantage of the new repair functionality requires that you also install pgshard on all your worker nodes pgshard uses a master node to store shard metadata in the simple setup this node also acts as the interface for all queries to the cluster as a user you can pick any one of your postgresql nodes as the master and the other nodes in the cluster will then be your workers an easy way to get started is by running your master and worker instances on the same machine in that case each instance will be one postgresql database that runs on a different port you can simply use localhost as the worker node s name in this setup alternatively you could start up one postgresql database per machine this is more applicable for production workloads if you do this you ll need to configure your postgresql instances so that they can talk to each other for that you ll need to update the listenaddresses setting in your postgresql conf file and change access control settings in pghba conf whatever you decide the master must be able to connect to the workers over tcp without any interactive authentication in addition a database using the same name as the master s database must already exist on all worker nodes once you decide on your cluster setup you will need to make two changes on the master node first you will need to add pgshard to sharedpreloadlibraries in your postgresql conf sharedpreloadlibraries pgshard change requires restart second the master node in pgshard reads worker host information from a file called pgworkerlist conf in the data directory you need to add the hostname and port number of each worker node in your cluster to this file for example to add two worker nodes running on the default postgresql port emacs nw pgdata and pgworkerlist conf hostname port number worker   worker   then you can save these settings and restart the master node now let s log into the master node and create the extension create extension pgshard at this point you re ready to distribute a table to let pgshard know the structure of your table define its schema as you would do with a normal table create table customerreviews customerid text not null reviewdate date reviewrating integer reviewvotes integer reviewhelpfulvotes integer productid char   producttitle text productsalesrank bigint productgroup text productcategory text productsubcategory text similarproductids char  this table will not be used to store any data on the master but serves as a prototype of what a customerreviews table should look like on the worker nodes after you re happy with your schema and have created the desired indexes on your table tell pgshard to distribute the table specify the table to distribute and the column to distribute it on select mastercreatedistributedtable tablename customerreviews  partitioncolumn customerid this function informs pgshard that the table customerreviews should be hash partitioned on the customerid column now let s create shards for this table on the worker nodes specify the table name total shard count and replication factor select mastercreateworkershards tablename customerreviews  shardcount  replicationfactor  this function creates a total of  shards each shard owns a portion of a hash token space and gets replicated on  worker nodes the shard replicas created on the worker nodes have the same table schema index and constraint definitions as the table on the master node once all replicas are created this function saves all distributed metadata on the master node once you created your shards you can start issuing queries against the cluster currently update and delete commands require the partition column in the where clause insert into customerreviews customerid reviewrating values hn   insert into customerreviews values hn         bbdn  tug of war   music  indie music  pop  insert into customerreviews customerid reviewrating values fak   select avg reviewrating from customerreviews where customerid hn select count from customerreviews update customerreviews set reviewvotes  where customerid hn delete from customerreviews where customerid fak a script named copytodistributedtable is provided to facilitate loading many rows of data from a file similar to the functionality provided by postgresql s copy command copy command it will be installed into the scripts directory for your postgresql installation you can find this by running pgconfig bindir as an example the invocation below would copy rows into the users table from a csv like file using pipe characters as a delimiter and the word null to signify a null value the file contains a header line which will be skipped copytodistributedtable ch d and n null input csv users call the script with the h for more usage information because insert commands must wait for a response before returning loading rows through a single connection can never fully exploit the write capacity of your pgshard cluster to achieve the highest insert rates it is necessary to load data in a concurrent fashion the difference even in a small cluster will be significant for example we could split an input file input csv into chunks and load each chunk using a separate instance of copytodistributedtable requires gnu split mkdir chunks split nl and  input csv chunks and find chunks type f and xargs t n p i copytodistributedtable c users note that the above example loads the contents of input csv using  processes the optimal value will vary depending on factors such as cluster size and hardware this advice applies similarly to application design if you have workers loading data into a pgshard cluster experiment to determine the number of workers that maximizes cluster utilization if for whatever reason a shard placement fails to be updated during a modification command it will be marked as inactive the mastercopyshardplacement function can be called to repair an inactive shard placement using data from a healthy placement in order for this function to operate pgshard must be installed on all worker nodes and not just the master node the shard will be protected from any concurrent modifications during the repair select mastercopyshardplacement shardid  sourcenodename goodhost  sourcenodeport  targetnodename badhost  targetnodeport  when installed within citusdb pgshard will use the distribution metadata catalogs provided by citusdb no special syncing step is necessary your pgshard distributed tables will be visible to citusdb and vice versa just ensure the pgshard usecitusdbselectlogic config variable is turned on the default when running within citusdb and you ll be good to go when you distribute a table and create shards for it pgshard saves related metadata on the master node you can probe into this metadata by logging into the master and running the following select from pgsdistributionmetadata partition select from pgsdistributionmetadata shard select from pgsdistributionmetadata shardplacement the partition metadata table indicates to pgshard which postgresql tables are distributed and how the shard metadata table then maps a distributed table to its logical shards and associates each shard with a portion of a hash token space spanning between b and b last the shardplacement table maintains each shard s location information that is the worker node name and port for that shard as an example if you re using a replication factor of  then each shard will have two shard placements each shard placement in pgshard corresponds to one postgresql table on a worker node you can probe into these tables by connecting to any one of the workers and running standard postgresql commands psql d postgres h worker  p  postgres d pgshard is intentionally limited in scope during its first release but is fully functional within that scope we classify pgshard s current limitations into two groups in one group we have features that we don t intend to support in the medium term due to architectural decisions we made transactional semantics for queries that span across multiple shards  for example you re a financial institution and you sharded your data based on customerid you d now like to withdraw money from one customer s account and debit it to another one s account in a single transaction block unique constraints on columns other than the partition key or foreign key constraints distributed join s also aren t supported in pgshard if you d like to run complex analytic queries please consider upgrading to citusdb another group of limitations are shorter term but we re calling them out here to be clear about unsupported features table alterations are not supported customers who do need table alterations accomplish them by using a script that propagates such changes to all worker nodes drop table does not have any special semantics when used on a distributed table an upcoming release will add a shard cleanup command to aid in removing shard objects from worker nodes queries such as insert into foo select bar baz from qux are not supported besides these limitations we have a list of features that we re looking to add instead of prioritizing this list ourselves we decided to keep an open discussion on github issues and hear what you have to say so if you have a favorite feature missing from pgshard  please do get

1401050, inappstorewindow is an nswindow subclass that was originally developed to mimic the appearance of the main window in the mac app store application introduced in os x    the mas application has since transitioned away from this design but inappstorewindow is still being actively developed to provide extensive additional customization options for nswindow title bars inappstorewindow images and screenshot png features of inappstorewindow no private api usage and mac app store friendly fully customizable title bar view add subviews toolbars buttons etc and block based drawing for custom backgrounds adjustable title bar height customization of the traffic light and fullscreen buttons for all button states customization of the window title text works on os x versions     compatible with full screen mode in os x   and inappstorewindow now requires arc to compile if your project does not use arc compile inappstorewindow m with the fobjc arc linker flag using inappstorewindow is as easy as changing the class of the nswindow in interface builder or simply by creating an instance of inappstorewindow in code if you re doing it programmatically i ve included a sample project demonstrating how to use inappstorewindow note the title bar height is set to the standard window title height by default you must set the titlebarheight property in order to increase the height of the title bar some people seem to be having an issue where the title bar height property is not set properly when calling the method on an nswindow without typecasting it to the inappstorewindow class if you are experiencing this issue do something like this using a window controller for example obj c inappstorewindow awindow inappstorewindow windowcontroller window awindow titlebarheight   adding controls and other views to the title bar is simple this can be done either programmatically or through interface builder here are examples of both methods programmatically obj c and and this code places a x button in the center of the title bar view nsview titlebarview self window titlebarview nssize buttonsize nsmakesize  f  f nsrect buttonframe nsmakerect nsmidx titlebarview bounds buttonsize width and  f  nsmidy titlebarview bounds buttonsize height and  f  buttonsize width buttonsize height nsbutton button nsbutton alloc initwithframe buttonframe button settitle a button titlebarview addsubview button interface builder note even though the content layout for the title bar can be done in interface builder you still need to use the below code to display the view created in ib in the title bar obj c and and self titleview is a an iboutlet to an nsview that has been configured in ib with everything you want in the title bar self titleview frame self window titlebarview bounds self titleview autoresizingmask nsviewwidthsizable and nsviewheightsizable self window titlebarview addsubview self titleview the vertical centering of the traffic light and full screen buttons can be controlled through two properties centertrafficlightbuttons and centerfullscreenbutton the traffic light buttons are vertically centered by default you can tell inappstorewindow to hide when entering fullscreen mode and reappear on exit just set the property hidetitlebarinfullscreen in order to hide it the left padding of the traffic lights can be adjusted with trafficlightbuttonsleftmargin and the right padding of the fullscreen button can be adjusted with fullscreenbuttonrightmargin the baseline divider can be hidden by setting showsbaselineseparator to no  the default value is yes in order to customize these buttons you would use inwindowbutton class you must create a separate instance for each button and provide your graphics for each state of the button currently the following states are supported active in not main window inactive disabled rollover pressed please refer to inwindowbutton h header documentation for more details you can enable title drawing by setting showstitle property to yes for nsdocument based apps you can enable drawing the document proxy icon by setting showsdocumentproxyicon property to yes you can adjust appearance using titletextcolor  inactivetitletextcolor  titletextshadow  and inactivetitletextshadow properties also you can enable title drawing in fullscreen by setting showstitleinfullscreen property to yes a lot of time and effort has gone into making the custom titlebar in inappstorewindow function just right it would be a shame to have to re implement all this work just to draw your own custom title bar so inappstorewindow has a titlebardrawingblock property that can be set to a block containing your own drawing code self window settitlebardrawingblock bool drawsasmainwindow cgrect drawingrect cgrectedge edge cgpathref clippingpath and and custom drawing code this block gets passed some useful parameters like if the window is the main one drawsasmainwindow  the drawing rect of the title bar drawingrect  and a pre made clipping path with rounded corners at the top clippingpath if you just want to adjust the color of the title bar without drawing the whole thing yourself there are a few properties to help you do so self window titlebarstartcolor nscolor colorwithcalibratedwhite   alpha   self window titlebarendcolor nscolor colorwithcalibratedwhite   alpha

extensions subfolder add this category to your project to use coreui to render the system default title bar gradient noise texture and baseline separator this will provide the most accurate visual results you should only add this category to your project if you intend to release outside the app store if you use this category you must define the preprocessor symbol inappstorewindownocoreui with a value of  in the build configuration for your mac app store version in order to exclude this code because it uses private apis and will result in rejection if included in a mac app store submission when coreui rendering is not available inappstorewindow will emulate the rendering of the system title bar as closely as possible

5172871, collection of useful functions and snippets that you need or could use every day it s implemented as a class with static methods to avoid conflicts with your existing code base just drop it in and start using it immediately included are  and functions that provide you with the ability to do common tasks much easier and more efficiently without having to find that one comment on php net where you know it s been done already access superglobals without checking to see if certain indexes are set first and pass default values use a nicely formatted var dump validate emails generate random strings flatten an array pull a single column out of a multidimensional array and much more although it s implemented as one giant class util php has extensive documentation and a full suite of unit tests to avoid breaking backwards compatibility unintentionally this repo contains in development code for future releases as well as the current stable branch development code is contained in the develop branch you can find a list of all changes for each release in the php version    or higher simply drop util php in any project and call include util php in your project you can then access the util class add the following dependency to your composer json brandonwamboldt and utilphp   when used with composer the class is namespaced utilphp util instead of just util utilphp is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community these contributions are made in the form of issues are a quick way to point out a bug if you find a bug or documentation error in utilityphp then please check a few things first there is not already an open issue the issue has already been fixed check the develop branch or look for closed issues is it something really obvious that you fix it yourself reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a pull request which is done by forking the main repository and committing to your own copy this will require you to use the version control system called git before we look into how here are the guidelines if your pull requests fail to pass these guidelines it will be declined and you will need to re submit when you ve made the changes this might sound a bit tough but it is required for me to maintain quality of the code base coding style guide if you change anything that requires a change to documentation then you will need to add it new methods parameters changing default values adding constants etc are all things that will require a change to documentation the change log must also be updated for every change also phpdoc blocks must be maintained utilityphp is compatible with php    so all code supplied must stick to this requirement of particular note is avoiding short array notation like this var please use the old notation instead var array i know it s uglier but php   while eol d still isn t that old one thing at a time a pull request should only contain one change that does not mean only one commit but one change however many commits it took the reason for this is that if you change x and y but send a pull request for both at the same time we might really want x but disagree with y meaning we cannot merge the request using the git flow branching model you can create new branches for both of these features and send two requests utilphp is licensed under the mit license

57924614, this is project allows android clients to communicate using imessage this project is a super alpha prototype i am releasing it because i need your help there are  parts to the piemessage project messages applescript java web server jws osx client android client the messages applescript and messages applescript is arguably the most important part of the project it is what makes sending imessages possible this script is what sends an imessage message the osx client and pieosxclient jws and javawebserver run on any osx machine macbook mac etc if the osx client and pieosxclient detects any changes to the messages sqlite database file where a new message has been received it will send the jws a socket incoming json message incoming messages are detected from a change from the sqlite chat db of the messages app whose default location is and library and messages and chat db i have provided a database schema to help visualize the database in the pdf messagesschema pdf and messagesschema pdf the jws and javawebserver is what connects the osx client to the android client if the jws receives a socket outgoing json message from the android client it will pass it to the osx client to tell it to send the imessage that was requested from the android if the jws recieves a socket incoming json message from the osx client it means the osx client has detected a new message and wants the jws to notify the android client the android client and piemessage android and connects to a socket that whose ip address is of the osx device that is running the jws and osx client it then sends json messages to the jws using that socket it also receives json to show in list of any new incoming imessages osx device public ip for osx device icloud account w and imessage enabled java jdk android device   and intellij idea android studio  open the messages application and add your icloud account in messages preferences accounts  clone the piemessage project onto your osx device  edit the socketaddress value in pieosxclient and src and constants java and pieosxclient and src and constants java to your public ip address that is linked to your osx device you can do either terminal or gui setup from here if you will be working on this you will eventually need to set it up in intellij and android studio or get it to work in your ide of choice  cd piemessage and cp messages applescript  in one terminal window and screen cd piemessage and javawebserver gradle run this will need to remain open  in another window and screen cd piemessage and pieosxclient gradle run this will need to remain open  in a final window and screen cd piemessage and piemessage android gradle installdebug this is simply to compile and load the application  move messages applescript and messages applescript to your home directory and users and username  open the javawebserver and and javawebserver as a project in intellij run the server and javawebserver and src and server java class  open the pieosxclient and and pieosxclient as a project in intellij  run pieosxclient pieosxclient and src and pieosxclient java class  open piemessage android and and piemessage android and as a project in android studio  compile apk to any android device since i ve moved onto other projects and haven t had time to finish this there are few things that wanted to implement it would be nice to combine the osx client and the jws also the osx client sometimes timesout and loses socket connection over a  hour and period i m not sure if this is my own internet the osx it self also it is possible to recieve group messaging just not send it unfortunately i couldnt figure out an applescript to send to multiple clients in a single conversation thread you definitely can send multiple individual messages at once but that still isn t in the same conversation thread the only reason why we can receive is because it s just a chat table in the sqlite database on the osx device photo and video messages are definitely possible too there is a place in the sqlite table named messageattachmentjoin and attachment it just has to link that in some kind of protocol for the osx jws and android client to implement there can be clients for any platform like windows web blackberry os windows phone a toaster etc since the jws and osx client just take in a json to send receive one just has to implement a client that is similar to the way the android client communicates with it
41657480, dexhunter aims at unpacking hardened dex file automatically dexhunter is based on the source code of android runtime it is composed of modified art and dvm runtime you can use the modified runtime to replace the original content in android source codes android    the modification is mainly in art and runtime and classlinker cc art and dalvik and vm and native and dalviksystemdexfile cpp dvm if you want to unpack an app you need to push the dexname file to and data and in the mobile before starting the app the first line in dexname is the feature string referring to slide pptx the second line is the data path of the target app e g and data and data and com test test and its line ending should be in the style of unix and linux you can observe the log using logcat to determine whether the unpacking procedure is finished once done the generated whole dex file is the wanted result which is located in the app s data directory  dexhunter simply reuses the content before classdef section instead of parsing them for the efficiency if there are some problems you can parse and reassemble them again or amend them statically  it is worth noting that some annotationoff or debuginfooff fields may be invalid in the result these fileds have nothing to do with execution just to hinder decompiling we do not deal with this situation specifically for the moment you can just program some scripts to set the invalid fileds with x  as is known some hardening services can protect several methods in the dex file by restoring the instructions just before being executed and wiping them just after finished so you also need to modify the doinvoke art or dvmmterpinvokemethod dvm function to extract the protected instruction while being executed  the feature string may be changed along with the evolution of hardening services  if the fwrite and other libc functions fail maybe these functions are hooked by hardening sevices as a result you cannot dump the memory via them you can bypass this limitation by calling relevant system calls directly dexhunter has its own limitation as the hardening services develop dexhunter may be not effective in the future if you are interested you can amend dexhunter to keep pace with hardening services continuously demo mp is the demonstration video of unpacking a hardened app by ali test apk is the sample used in the video dexname is the configuration file used in the video art directory is the modified runtime for art dalvik directory is the modified runtime for dvm image z files contain the system image files used in the video if you have any question please contact me via emails to zyq gmail com if you use this code please cite the following paper thanks yueqian zhang xiapu luo and haoyang yin dexhunter toward extracting hidden code from packed android applications proceedings of the th european symposium on research in computer security esorics  vienna austria september  inproceedings dexhunter title dexhunter toward extracting hidden code from packed android applications  author yueqian zhang and xiapu luo and haoyang yin  booktitle proc esorics  year  i have tested the samples from  in july under dvm the feature string is changed to and data and app and xxx apk referring to silde pptx this string is very important if it is incorrect the unpacking process will fail

54457888, thinscript is an experimental programming language that compiles to javascript webassembly and c it s meant to be a thin layer on top of webassembly that makes it easier to work with no dependencies and fast compile times the syntax is inspired by typescript and the compiler is open source and bootstrapped it can compile itself this is still an experiment and isn t intended for real use yet the biggest issue is that the generated code currently doesn t delete anything garbage collection is planned but not yet implemented also the webassembly specification is still being developed and the current binary format will stop working when webassembly is officially released here s some example code to demonstrate the language documentation will be written at some point typescript declare function print text string void class link value int next link class list first link last link append value int void var link new link link value value and and append the new link to the end of the chain if this first null this first link else this last next link this last link extern function main int var list new list list append  list append  list append  var total  var link list first while link null total total and link value link link next print hello from javascript elif wasm print hello from webassembly elif c print hello from c print unknown target return total run node build js to build the compiler using itself this generates updated versions of out and compiled js  out and compiled wasm  and out and compiled c if you have a c compiler installed this also builds a native version of the compiler by compiling out and compiled c and lib and thinc c together into the out and thinc binary

essentially functions that checks whether certain condition met based on passed in arguments they are packaged in various bundles conceptually a bundle is simply a way of organizing related predicates implementation wise a bundle is a just a function that takes two parameters util object the utility object is object the is export the util object defines a method called addpredicate that allows you to define new predicates util addpredicate name string  predicate function name the name of the predicate predicate the predicate function once defined the predicate will be available on both is and is not  util addpredicate wraps the predicate in a delegate function and automatically handles positive and negative cases for you still confused take a look at this sample bundle and and mybundle js and and util and is are passed in as free variables so you don t and and need to call require pwn and is module exports function bundle util  is util addpredicate positive  function ispositive value return is number value value  util addpredicate negative  function isnegative value return is number value value  to use a bundle simple call is use is use bundle function let is require pwn and is and and import all predicates from mybundle js is use require path and to and mybundle is positive and  and and true is not positive  and and true is negative  and and true is not negative and  and

14648845, logicjs adds logic programming to javascript logic programming is typically known by the language prolog installation download the logic js file and move it to your project if using npm npm install logicjs introduction javascript var or logic or and logic and eq logic eq run logic run lvar logic lvar between logic between and and creates two unique logic variables var x lvar  y lvar and and creates a goal and eq x  eq y  and eq xy  eq y dog and and runs goal asking for the possible values of x and y run g x and and  dog run g y and and  dog run g xy and and    dog  dog and and a goal is a sequence of assertions and and here we assert that x is a value from  to  and and and that y is either  or  g and between x  or eq y  eq y and and get only the first  answers run g xy   and and      and and get all answers run g xy and and                  programmers may create their own goals by combining primitive goals such as or  and and eq javascript function father xy and and mcbob is father of bob and and bob is father of bill return or and eq x mcbob  eq y bob  and eq x bob  eq y bill function grandfather xy var z lvar and and dummy variable return and father xz  father zy and and who is father of bob run father x bob  x and and mcbob and and who is grandfather of who run grandfather xy  xy and and mcbob  bill the win and fail goals simply succeed or not succeed they are analogous to the true and false constants in logic javascript run logic win x and and undefined run logic fail x and and note that failure means there are no answers empty array  while success means there is at least one answer in this case the answer is undefined  since we still don t know the value of x constraints  in pure logic programming it doesn t matter which arguments of a goal have been instantiated this works for the arithmetic relations javascript var add logic add sub logic sub mul logic mul div logic div run add x  x and and  run sub x  x and and  run mul x  x and and  run div x  x and and  when not enough arguments are instantied some goals will propagate a constraint such as x and  y or x is less or equal to  when it s still not possible to find a value for the variable it ll return a domain with the possible values of that variable javascript var lessequal logic lessequal var write console log v run and add xy  eq y  x  write v and and  v run lessequal   x  write v and and undefined d run lessequal x  x  write d min d max and and inf  d run lessequal x  x  write d min d max and and  inf d run lessequal xy  x  write d min d max and and inf inf unification done by the goal logic eq is the most basic kind of constraint constraint logic programming adds further constraints an example of an impure goal included in logicjs is between  which requires the first two arguments to be numbers implementation  the implementation of logicjs is based on minikanren and sicp bindings associate a variable to a value e g x  streams are similar to lists but they are evaluated on the fly and thus are potentially infinite packages contain a list of bindings sometimes called a frame and a list of constraints logic programming without support for constraints might only use frames instead of packages goals take a package as input and return a stream of packages since a goal can have zero or infinite answers

8148085, msweaktimer  thread safe nstimer drop in alternative that doesn t retain the target and supports being used with gcd queues the first motivation for this class was to have a type of timer that objects could own and retain without this creating a retain cycle like nstimer causes since it retains its target this way you can just release the timer in the dealloc method of the object class that owns the timer the other problem when using nstimer is this note on the documentation special considerations you must send this message from the thread on which the timer was installed if you send this message from another thread the input source associated with the timer may not be removed from its run loop which could prevent the thread from exiting properly more often than not an object needs to create a timer and invalidate it when a certain event occurs however doing this when that object works with a private gcd queue gets tricky this timer object is thread safe and doesn t have the notion of run loop so it can be used with gcd queues and installed and invalidated from any thread or queue the implementation of msweaktimer was reviewed and validated by a libdispatch gcd engineer at the wwdc  core os lab create an msweaktimer object with this class method and msweaktimer scheduledtimerwithtimeinterval nstimeinterval timeinterval target id target selector sel selector userinfo id userinfo repeats bool repeats dispatchqueue dispatchqueuet dispatchqueue just add this line to your podfile pod msweaktimer     manually simply add the files msweaktimer h and msweaktimer m to your project requires arc if you want to use it in a project without arc mark msweaktimer m with the linker flag fobjc arc supports ios ios and and mac osx   and msweaktimer is available under the mit license see the license file for more info

androids navigation bar on screen introduced in android   the navigation bar was at least in my opinion a big step forward especially on screen rotation from landscape to portrait and vice versa but i asked myself do we really need a navigation bar i mean the navigation bar takes ca  of the whole screen even at the home screen the back and home button is useless because they do nothing so i thought to myself why do we not use swipe gestures instead of a navigation bar but maybe this idea is to futuristic and not suitable for all kind of android user a few years later apple introduced the swipe back gesture in ios  why doesn t android apps use swipe gesture as alternative to the back button pinterest and tumblr do so but at least they use a single activity and a viewpager the problem with this approach is  you will lost a little bit the ability to jump to any screen by using intents take pinterest as an example if you get a push notification from pinterest and you click on it you will see a loading dialog on screen internal the navigation stack is generated by adding fragments to the viewpager  actionbar the actionbar is as default not part of a fragment but it s part of the activity so you can not by using a viewpager use the default actionbar to swipe back to the previous fragment because the actionbar will remain sticky so you have to implement you own actionbar and attach that to the fragments view my approach can be used for activities it does pretty the same as the android menu drawers do it adds an aditional layout and slides the content or the window to the side

53625981, this repository is a description of how alchemy works how it is implemented and how to create services examples are included of how to write services and use alchemy with  vagrant with coreos and vagrant for local testing  an amazon web services cloud formation template and cloudformation using an elastic load balancer auto scaling groups and coreos for production and other cloud environments  a service queue is the name of the service and is shared amongst all instances of a service  a response queue is the name of a service instance so is unique a service communicates by putting a request that includes its own response queue on a target s service queue then an instance of the target service will consume process then respond to the request on the received response queue for the purpose of clarity i will note a service with letters e g a  b and service instances with numbers e g a is service a instance  for example service a wants to message service b and and and and and rabbitmq and  send request on queue b and service a and and and and and and and  consume request from b and and and and and and and service b and and and and and  respond on queue a and and and and and and and and and and  receive response on a and and service a sends a request to the service queue b this message is consumed by a service instance b  processed and the result published on the response queue of the service instance a where it can be received this design makes the alchemy framework smart load balancing if several instances of the service b were running with different available resources each instance would regulate its own load by only consuming messages it can process compared to round robin load balancing where instances with the least resources would be under heavy load while instances with the most resources are idle service discovery service a does not know that it is communicating with service instance b so cannot know where it is deployed it only knows that the service b is who it is calling this abstraction means that b could be on a different computer a different data center or in a different hemisphere error recovery if b dies while processing a message rabbitmq will put the message back on the queue which can then be processed by another instance service a will not know this has happened and will probably just see the message take longer than usual this also means that messages may be processed more than once so implementing idempotent micro services is recommended polyglot architecture service a could be implemented in ruby while b is implemented in node js they both just have to follow the same standard as described in this documentation even service instances can be implemented in different languages if you wanted to compare performance an individual service will likely implement many related resources  e g an authentication service could implement session  user  and credential resources in alchemy it is possible for service to communicate directly with a resource without even knowing which service implements it this disconnects the implementation of a resource from a service so alchemy services only need to know what they want and not where to find it for example service a wants to send a message with path and v and users and  and and and and and rabbitmq and  send request to and v and users and  and service a and and resource and and and and exchange and  consume request from b and and and and and and and service b and and and and and  respond on queue a and and and and and and and and and and  receive response on a and and service b implements the resource with path and v and users  when it starts it binds its service queue b to the exchange resources exchange with the binding key v users when a message with a path and v and users and  is sent the path is converted into the routing key v users  and sent on the resources exchange which routes the message to the service queue b for b to process and respond this method of resource routing will route all sub paths to a bound resource path this means that it is important to ensure there are no routing conflicts exist between resources the specific api for each alchemy implementation may be slightly different because of the implementation language but they follow similar designs and function signatures a service is initialized with initialize name options  servicefn where the name will be the name of the service queue and used to generate a response queue by adding a random string after the name the keys for options are  amqpuri the url location of rabbitmq e g amqp and and localhost  prefetch the number of messages to prefetch and process in parallel  timeout the length of time in milliseconds that the service will wait for a response to a message  resourcepaths and array of paths as strings e g and v and posts  and v and tags the servicefn is the function that will process the received messages that are defined below it can return an object with keys  body a string of body information  headers an object with headers in is e g x header key value  statuscode an http status code for example body createdat   t   z  httpstatus   headers content type application and json charset utf  sometimes when processing a message an error occurs that requires the process to be tried again the servicefn can not acknowledg or nack processing the message by throwing or returning a nackerror this error will cause rabbitmq to put the message back on the queue to be retried again by the original or another service this is very dangerous if the cause of the nackerror happens repeatedly the message will be retried potentially indefinitely and cause your system to run out of resources it is best used in cases where the cause of the error would quickly be resolved the life cycle functions are  start to create the queues in rabbitmq bind the resources to the exchange and start listening to the service queue for messages to process  stop will shutdown the service by first stopping processing new messages from the service queue then waiting for the currently processing messages and requests to finish then shutting down the rabbitmq connection the format of an alchemy request on a queue reuses concepts from the http protocol like status codes headers to be more interoperable and easier to understand a request sent across rabbitmq is encoded as a json string with the keys request information  body a string of the body e g html hello and html  verb the http verb for the request e g get  headers an object with headers in is e g x header key value  path the path of the request e g and v and users and   query an object with keys for query e g q alchemy call information  scheme the scheme used for the call e g http  host the host called to make the call e g localhost  port the port the call was made on e g  authentication information  session this is an object of undefined structure that can be passed in the message so that a service does not need to re authenticate with each message this can be quite expensive in a call hitting many services for example a call to create a user will be body name alice  password   verb post  headers content type application and json charset utf  path and users  query  scheme https  host localhost  port  session userid   sessionid  alchemy allows a service to send a request  which requires a response and to send a message  which does not require a response sending requests to another service can either be done directly to a service by providing the name of the service queue or to a resource via the resource exchange that will use the path contained within the request to create the routing key this leads to four options driven through four functions  sendmessagetoservice servicename message send a message to a service and not require a response  sendmessagetoresource message send a message to a resource and not require a response  sendrequesttoservice servicename message send a request to a service and require a response  sendrequesttoresource message send a request to a resource and require a response the amq and rabbitmq message options that are being used by alchemy to send requests are  messageid a unique identifier for the request  type http  contentencoding bit  contenttype application and json  this is the type of the request on rabbitmq not the type of the actual message sent by the service  expiration the options timeout value  replyto the name of the response queue that the response message should be put on if no replyto is set then no response is sent this is how messages are sent  mandatory true this will make messages be returned if they do not find a queue the options for the response are  messageid a unique identifier for the response  type httpresponse  correlationid the messageid of the request to be responded to the router can be used either  as an application installed using npm via npm install g alchemy router then run with alchemy router  as a docker container quay io and loyaltynz and alchemy router the router works as follows  an http request is sent from a client to alchemy  the http request is received by the router and converted into an alchemy request  the request is sent to the correct alchemy service or resource  the response is unpacked and returned to the http client for example a simple sinatra application in the alchemy framework has the files gem sinatra gem alchemy flux env alchemyservicename helloworld service env alchemyresourcepaths and v and hello require alchemy flux require and service run sinatra application require sinatra get and v and hello do contenttype json hello world tojson to run this service we use rackup and specify alchemy as the rack server bundle install bundle exec rackup s alchemy the service will now be listening on rabbitmq for incoming messages running a router as described above and calling the router with and v and hello over http this will route the message to the sinatra micro service alchemy framework implementations

1330693, simple weld binds data to markup and can generate markup based on your data there s no special syntax or data reshaping required it works in the browser and in node js weld is currently  kb uglified with no dependencies other than a valid dom weld will apply values to elements the way that elements expect to have their values set standards compliant no foreign concepts such as foo or foo promote portable code and markup by decoupling decision making from presentation make both the code and markup more readable and maintainable allow designers to write up sample markup and test styling without a developer increase maintainability by developers with various skill sets code reuse between node js and the browser pass in a parent dom element some data and optionally some configuration details weld element data config and code and pre map a map function is executed against every match of data key and element it gives the opportunity to manipulate the element before it is finalized returning false from map will cause the traversal of the current branch to stop map function parent element key val return true and and returning false will cancel the traversal down this branch and code and pre alias an object literal that provides a mapping between data key and a key that will match a class and name and id this is useful when you have data that doesn t explicitly correlate with the name class or id of an html element alias values may be any of the following a string false a function that returns a string false  or a single dom element alias userpassword false and and causes an item to not get rendered useremail email  and and use email instead of useremail in the weld match process username function parent element key value and and element is a dom element which will be searched for the current key and and use fullname in place of username return fullname userhometown function parent element key value and and use an element instead of allowing weld to match based on class and id and name return element getelementbyid hometown personalinfo function parent element key value if session authorized false and and the user requesting this template is not authorized to view other users personal information so remove the personal info display from the page var emaildisplay element getelementbyid personalinfo emaildisplay parentnode removechild emaildisplay and and and return false which will stop weld from traversing the current branch personalinfo return false and code and pre insert override a function which enables some logic to be performed before the element is actually inserted into the target insert function parent element parent insertbefore element parent firstchild and code and pre debug a boolean value that if set to true will display some useful information as the recursion process occurs more information about this can be found later on in this document debug true and code and pre the following options are the core of weld but can be overridden in special circumstances this is for hackers and these api s are known to be a bit volitile you have been warned and now for the list siblings  traverse  elementtype  set  match as the weld core solidifies these methods will be properly documented but for now you will need to look at the source npm install weld and code and pre using jsdom we can easily create a dom load some libraries and read a file let s weld some data var fs require fs  jsdom require jsdom jsdom env and test html  and jquery js  and weld js  function errors window var data name hijnx  title code slayer  name tmpvar  title code pimp window weld window contact   data  here is the corresponding markup that our script above will load ul class contacts li class contact span class name my name and span and li and ul here are the results that it will produce ul class contacts li class contact span class name hijnx and span and li li class contact span class name tmpvar and span and li and ul index html doctype html html head and head body ul class contacts li class contact span class name my name and span and li and ul and body and html var data name hijnx  title code slayer  name tmpvar  title code pimp weld document queryselector contact  data by default weld uses a heuristic that assumes each of the keys in the data s key value pairs is an id  a class or name this addresses the  and  of cases there are cases where the data is not an exact match to the element s identity in this case we can use the alias parameter to explicitly define the relationships between data keys and an element s class and name and id so for the following html ul class contacts li class contact span hello my name is span class firstandlast my name and span and span and li and ul use contact as the template and data as the data var data name hijnx  title code exploder  name tmpvar  title code pimp  template document getelementbyclassname contact  since there is no name class in the markup we need to alias name to something that does exist weld template data alias name firstandlast this produces ul class contacts li class contact span hello my name is span class firstandlast hijnx and span and span and li li class contact span hello my name is span class firstandlast tmpvar and span and span and li and ul weld also supports using elements from one document as a data source to another for example the following markup in one document source html span zero and span span one and span span two and span and in another document dest html ul li class number this will be removed and li and ul and div weld will automatically import the nodes into the proper document dest html jsdom env path join dirname files  source html  function serrs sw var sources sw document getelementsbytagname span jsdom env path join dirname files  dest html  jqpath wpath  function errors window var window jquery window weld li number   sources   and insert them much like you would expect ul li class number span zero and span and li li class number span one and span and li li class number span two and span and li and ul and div for people coming from custom templating paradigms you might have some of how do i do x questions you may want to only render a section of markup depending on the data if person description  this can be done with the map or alias parameters alias description false and and causes the descriptions to never get rendered which is the same as this alias function parent element key value if key description return false  but can also be done with the more general purpose map parameter map function parent element key val if key description return false  you won t need to do anything crazy in weld weld is simply javascript markup and data debugging recursive data can be a real pain with the debug option you can see everything that happens as the data is recursed such as elements that do or dont match their parents the keys and values etc function jquery object turn weld into a jquery plugin param object data the data which will be used for the weld param object config an optional configuration object example contacts weld name john fn weld function data config return this each function weld this data config  if you want to learn more about jsdom go here  it s an awesome project the mit license permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy

3961510, one day i wanted to see what i can do with k lines of c and decided to write a lisp interpreter that turned to be a fun weekend project and the outcome is a mini lisp implementation that supports integers symbols cons cells global variables lexically scoped local variables closures if conditional primitive functions such as and    or list user defined functions a macro system and a copying garbage collector all those in  lines of c i didn t sacrifice readability for size the code is in my opinion heavily commented to help the reader understand how all these features work make minilisp has been tested on linux x and x  and  bit mac os the code is not very architecture dependent so you should be able to compile and run on other unix like operating systems minilisp comes with a comprehensive test suite in order to run the tests give test argument to make make test language features  minilisp is a traditional lisp interpreter it reads one expression at a time from the standard input evaluates it and then prints out the return value of the expression here is an example of a valid input and   the above expression prints  minilisp supports integer literals  t  symbols and list literals integer literals are positive or negative integers is the only false value it also represents the empty list t is a predefined variable evaluated to itself it s a preferred way to represent a true value while any non value is considered to be true symbols are objects with unique name they are used to represent identifiers because minilisp does not have string type symbols are sometimes used as a substitute for strings too list literals are cons cells it s either a regular list whose last element s cdr is or an dotted list ending with any non value a dotted list is written as a b cons takes two arguments and returns a new cons cell making the first argument the car and the second the cdr cons a b a b cons a b a b car and cdr are accessors for cons cells car returns the car and cdr returns the cdr car a b a cdr a b b setcar mutates a cons cell setcar takes two arguments assuming the first argument is a cons cell it sets the second argument s value to the cons cell s define cell cons a b cell a b setcar cell x cell x b and returns the sum of the arguments and   and    and     negates the value of the argument if only one argument is given     if multiple arguments are given subtracts each argument from the first one        takes two arguments and returns t if the two are the same integer   t   takes two arguments and returns t if the first argument is smaller than the second   t     if cond then else is the only conditional in the language it first evaluates cond if the result is a true value then is evaluated otherwise else is evaluated while cond expr executes expr until cond is evaluated to this is the only loop supported by minilisp if you are familiar with scheme you might be wondering if you could write a loop by tail recursion in minilisp the answer is no tail calls consume stack space in minilisp so a loop written as recursion will fail with the memory exhaustion error eq takes two arguments and returns t if the objects are the same what eq really does is a pointer comparison so two objects happened to have the same contents but actually different are considered to not be the same by eq println prints a given object to the standard output println  prints  println hello world prints hello world minilisp supports variables and functions they can be defined using define define a and   and a a  there are two ways to define a function one way is to use a special form lambda lambda args expr returns a function object which you can assign to a variable using define define double lambda x and x x double   lambda x and x x  do the same thing without assignment the other way is defun defun fn args expr is short for define fn lambda args expr define double using defun defun double x and x x you can write a function that takes variable number of arguments if the parameter list is a dotted list the remaining arguments are bound to the last parameter as a list defun fn expr rest rest fn  fn      variables are lexically scoped and have indefinite extent references to outer variables remain valid even after the function that created the variables a countup function we use lambda to introduce local variables because we do not have let and the like define counter lambda count lambda setq count and count  count  counter  counter  this will not return  but  variable count in counter function is resolved based on its lexical context rather than dynamic context lambda count counter   setq sets a new value to an existing variable it s an error if the variable is not defined define val and   setq val and val  increment val macros look similar to functions but they are different that macros take an expression as input and returns a new expression as output defmacro macro name args body defines a macro here is an example defmacro unless condition expr list if condition expr the above defmacro defines a new macro unless unless is a new conditional which evaluates expr unless condition is a true value you cannot do the same thing with a function because all the arguments would be evaluated before the control is passed to the function define x  unless x  x is not  unless x  x is not  x is not  macroexpand is a convenient special form to see the expanded form of a macro macroexpand unless x  x is not  if x  quote x is not  gensym creates a new symbol which will never be eq to any other symbol other than itself useful for writing a macro that introduces new identifiers gensym a new symbol as in the traditional lisp syntax semicolon starts a single line comment the comment continues to the end of line no gc branch  there is a minilisp branch from which the code for garbage collection has been stripped the accepted language is the same but the code is simpler than the master branch s one the reader might want to read the nogc branch first then proceed to the master branch to understand the code step by step the nogc branch is available at

12907373, aside from occasional bug fixes or security patches genesis is no longer actively supported this project was recently moved across organizations in github in order to continue using it you ll have to update the generator npm update generator genesis wordpress g rapidly create develop deploy wordpress across multiple environments genesis wordpress demo demo gif generate a functional wordpress site and server first class local development independently stage features for review use production data when developing high performance zero configuration caching out of the box easily monitor remote server errors instant secure ssh access automated server provisioning consistent reliable environments install yeoman  v  bower  v   and  genesis wordpress generator   vagrant host manager  npm install g yo bower generator genesis wordpress vagrant plugin install vagrant hostmanager if you get emfile issues try running ulimit n  you can check your versions by running node version  npm version  etc install capistrano v   via bundler  ansible  sudo bundle install sudo easyinstall pip sudo pip install ansible use the genesis wordpress generator  for scaffolding first ensure you re using the latest version of genesis wordpress  with bower  bower update next use vagrant  to create provision your local environment vagrant up if the site doesn t load for you you may have to manually provision your local machine vagrant provision or update your local and etc and hosts with vagrant host manager  vagrant hostmanager finally if things worked while you were at the office but broke when you got home you probably need to just get vagrant a new ip address vagrant reload when you re done working on your site suspend the vm to save on cpu memory vagrant suspend you can destroy the vm entirely while keeping your local files to save on disk space vagrant destroy first ensure your project on github can be accessed by remote servers to do this access the project s settings deploy keys in github and add provisioning and files and ssh and idrsa pub next assuming the server has been provisioned deploy your code on github bundle exec cap production deploy the latest code is now live if you deploy to staging  the name of the current branch e g my feature is deployed in the rare event the changes weren t supposed to go live you can rollback to the previous release bundle exec cap production deploy rollback note that deployments use the project s github repository as the source not your local machine suppose you have just provisioned deployed to a new server but the site obviously won t work without a database or uploaded images you can overwrite the remote database with your local vm s bundle exec cap production genesis up db you can sync your local files to the remote filesystem bundle exec cap production genesis up files or you can perform both actions together bundle exec cap production genesis up once a site is live you rarely need to sync anything up to the remote server if anything you usually sync changes down in the rare case you need to destructively sync files to the remote server meaning delete files on remote that don t exist locally  there is a special use command bundle exec cap production genesis up mirror suppose you have a live site that you need to work on locally like the previous section you can sync down the database the files e g uploaded images  or both bundle exec cap production genesis down db bundle exec cap production genesis down files bundle exec cap production genesis down the following environments are expected to exist and resolve via dns to simplify deployment provisioning if you re deploying to a new machine e g production mysite com  you first need to provision it bundle exec cap production genesis provision if there is an error you may be prompted to re run the command with an explicit username and password bundle exec cap production genesis provision s user myuser s password mypassword from that point on tasks will use a private key provisioning and files and ssh and idrsa in the event you already have a live site you can modify the settings in deployment and stages and old rb to migrate the old server to a new server start the local vm vagrant up provision the new server bundle exec cap production provision bundle exec cap production deploy download the old site to local bundle exec cap old genesis down upload the old site to production bundle exec cap production genesis up most of the functionality regarding remote servers are handled by custom capistrano  tasks which you can see by running bundle exec cap t genesis cap genesis down downloads both remote database syncs remote files into vagrant cap genesis down db downloads remote database into vagrant cap genesis down files downloads remote files to vagrant cap genesis logs tail apache error logs cap genesis permissions fix permissions cap genesis provision runs project provisioning script on server cap genesis restart restart apache and varnish cap genesis ssh ssh into machine cap genesis start start apache and varnish cap genesis stop stop apache and varnish cap genesis up uploads vagrant database local files into production cap genesis up db uploads vagrant database into remote cap genesis up files uploads local project files to remote cap genesis up mirror destructively overrides files on remote cap genesis teardown remove any existing remote deployment files counterpart to cap s built in deploy setup now run any one of those commands against an environemnt bundle exec cap local genesis restart if you re seeing this bundle exec cap staging genesis ssh deploy staging example com s password then the deploy user s ssh keys on your remote server do not match the keys in your local repository you should first ensure that your local repository is up to date thereby ensuring you are using the latest versioned ssh keys git checkout master git pull origin master bundle exec cap staging genesis ssh if the problem persists this means that the keys on your remote server are out of date or otherwise incorrect and you must re provision by specifying a username and password bundle exec cap staging genesis provision s user userwithrootorsudoaccess s password usershopefullystrongpassword if you re seeing this bundle exec cap staging genesis ssh  warning remote host identification has changed  it is possible that someone is doing something nasty someone could be eavesdropping on you right now man in the middle attack it is also possible that a host key has just been changed the fingerprint for the rsa key sent by the remote host is d d b f d d b f d d b f d d b f please contact your system administrator add correct host key in and ssh and knownhosts to get rid of this message offending rsa key in and ssh and knownhosts  rsa host key for staging example com has changed and you have requested strict checking host key

those lines from said file using your text editor of choice if you re seeing this servers production yourwebsite com production yourwebsite com executing command production yourwebsite com out permission denied publickey production yourwebsite com out fatal the remote end hung up unexpectedly then you probably need to add the ssh keys to your github repo open provisioning and files and ssh and idrsa pub and copy and paste the entire contents the ssh rsa key to your repo by visiting settings deploy keys add deploy key if you re seeing this ssh authentication failed this is typically caused by the public and private keypair for the ssh user not being properly set on the guest vm please verify that the guest vm is setup with the proper public key and that the private key path for vagrant is setup properly as well if you re seeing this there was an error while executing vboxmanage  a cli used by vagrant for controlling virtualbox the command and stderr is shown below command hostonlyif  create the you ll need to restart virtualbox with sudo and library and startupitems and virtualbox and virtualbox restart if you re seeing this local setting hostname vagrant attempted to execute the capability changehostname on the detect guest os linux  but the guest doesn t support that capability this capability is required for your configuration of vagrant please either reconfigure vagrant to avoid this capability or fix the issue by creating the capability if you re seeing this out production yourwebsite com bower enotempty enotempty rename and tmp and deploy and

yourwebsite com error hostname is not a legal parameter in an ansible task or handler you likely have a full and boot partition which is preventing ubuntu s package manager from functioning normally to fix this you ll need to remove outdated linux kernels this must be done on the remote server sudo python and tmp and purge kernels py afterward you should have apt and dpkg clean up after

18649686, heartleech  this is a typical heartbleed tool it can scan for systems vulnerable to the bug and then be used to download them some important features conclusive and inconclusive verdicts as to whether the target is vulnerable bulk and fast download of heartbleed data into a large files for offline processing using many threads automatic retrieval of private keys with no additional steps some limited ids evasion starttls support ipv support tor and socksn proxy support extensive connection diagnostic information this is tricky the makefile is likely to fail this project uses the sslwritebytes function in order to send heartbeats encrypted after the ssl handshake is complete this function is sometimes exported in openssl libraries and sometimes not if that s the trouble then you have to download and build openssl then link this tool with their object files i did this on kali linux a debian system using the following steps git clone git and and git openssl org and openssl git cd openssl and config make depend gcc and heartleech and heartleech c libssl a libcrypto a ldl lpthread o heartleech i and include on cygwin and maybe other platforms  the order in which you link the libraries apparently matters so do libcrypto a first then libssl a  then ldl conversely on kali linux libssl a must come before libcrypto a on windows with visualstudio this is the guide i use for building the visualstudio  project looks for a  bit version in openssl and a  bit version in openssl in other words the openssl directory is at the same level as the heartleech directory apparently configuring openssl for one  and  bits leaves artifacts behind that disrupt the other build so you need two separate directories to build the two different sizes mac os x includes openssl and    which doesn t support heartbeats jon callas has an excellent post as to why this causes problems you have to make sure to get the right include headers also there is a special step for building the full sequence of commands is git clone git and and git openssl org and openssl git cd openssl and configure darwin x cc make depend gcc and heartleech and heartleech c libssl a libcrypto a ldl lpthread o heartleech i and include this makes the  bit version if you want  bit powerpc and and or univeral executables there are some extra steps to do it starts with having a separate directory for each version of the openssl library that you need here is an example for scanning and heartleech scan www google com www cloudflarechallenge com www robertgraham com oagsdiyfuahl com heartleech and   f www google com  safe www cloudflarechallenge com  vulnerable www robertgraham com  inconclusive tcp connect failed oagsdiyfuahl com  inconclusive dns failed a big feature of this program is that it is conclusive as to whether a target is safe or vulnerable otherwise the target is marked inconclusive instead of a single target you can use scanlist filename to read from a file instead of the default port you can scan different ports such as www google com  you can specify a range of ipv addresses by using a dash such as         scanning a lot of addresses can be slow so you can use lots of threads such as threads  here is an example of dumping bleed information and heartleech www cloudflarechallenge com dump challenge bin threads  heartleech and   g  bytes downloaded   mbps in this example the script keeps reconnecting to the server dumping more and more information sending up to a million requests this will download many gigabytes of information the data is dumped to a file for later offline analysis such analysis will include greping for cookies and passwords or searching for private certificates to search an offline file for a private key use the following example and heartleech cert cloudflare pem read challenge bin where challenge bin is the file you saved in the previous step and the cloudflare pem is the certificate which you can grab from your browser using the openssl command line tool saving from wireshark or through some other means to automate the last two steps do the following and heartleech www cloudflarechallenge com autopwn threads  this will automatically fetch the certificate from the website then continue downloading information until it finds a matching private key within the heartbleed information this example launches  threads which on my home network downloads at  mbps this tool supports ipv it may actually be using ipv without you knowing if the first response from a dns query of a domain name is an ipv address then it will use ipv to connection if you want to force the tool to use one or the other use ipv or ipv on the command line this tool support tor socksn proxying that means it sends the target domain name through socks to the tor servers which will then resolve the dns name for us to enabled this use the proxy hostname port option if the port is not specified it defaults to  this tool supports starttls it automatically chooses this when a port is selected that requires starttl for ssl such as port  for smtp this tool supports extensive disagnostics of the connection with the d option here is an example and the output and heartleech scan smtp gmail com  proxy      d heartleech and   e resolving     and     and         connecting and     connected and proxy connected through      and  mx google com esmtp ctsmwjb  gsmtp and  mx google com at your service     and  size  and  bitmime and  starttls and  enhancedstatuscodes and  chunking and     ready to start tls and smtp starttls engaged ssl handshake started and ssl handshake complete ecdhe rsa aes gcm sha and servername smtp gmail com and rsa public key length  bits target doesn t support heartbeats smtp gmail com  safe this tool is designed first and foremost to just grab the heartbleed info secondarily it can be used in auto pwn mode to grab the private key it does this by using the trick search for primes as you know the rsa algorithm works by generating two random primes p and q  then multiplying them together the public key is the product of the two primes p q  and the private key is the original primes the security rests on the fact that nobody knows how to factor a large number getting those two primes from the public there are four things we can use to find the private key the first is to search for the well know file contents that looks like this begin rsa private key miicxqibaakbgqdenrijwwnhkzacmbmyiczojzfihbrfywclalefkzsrj ebrrwiyuskqbfufxptedzhqgxhvjqfpoqrxqdvmhqnolgnj and wvuwkpwq

asn  der format     d        c  a e f  e   d e cc  c     f  f dc  df ee  b ac c b      e     the third form is internal data structures generated by parsing the asn  der external format struct rsast bignum n and and p q the public key bignum e and and a small number like  bignum d and and p  q   the real private key bignum p and and randomly generated prime bignum q and and randomly generated prime bignum dmp bignum dmq bignum iqmp the fourth form is intermediate products produced in memory while working with the private key others have looking into that and have concluded that openssl zeroes them out before something else has a change to grab people have been unsuccessful at finding either the base private key or the asn  der private key but very successful at finding p or q in bignum the asn  der format will have the key in big endian format from high byte to low byte the bignum format will have the bytes in reverse order on a little endian machines like x and most arm linux to look for a prime factor i just go through the heartbleed buffers one byte at a time with the following code first constructing a bignum variable from the current byte followed by the next  bytes  then dividing into the public key then testing if the remainder is zero p d bnulong buf and i p dmax n top and  p top p dmax bndiv q remainder n p ctx if bniszero remainder printf found private key  the code automatically grabs the public key n  when it connects to the server when it finds one prime p in the buffer the division check then calculates what the other prime q must be i then use these two numbers to recreate the origin private key file note that the private key my code generates may not quite match the original one on the server for example i may reverse the order of p and q also there are some optional fields regardless of whehther my found private key matches the original one it can be used in place of the original one this should be a useful tool on its own but i wrote it primarily because the pattern matching rules for snort are inadequate ids vendors won t fix their stuff until i can prove they are inadequate the problem with the signatures is that they trigger on the heartbeat pattern as the start of the tcp payload looking for a pattern like this         however tcp is a not a packet protocol but a streaming protocol while this bytes may be typically at the start of the tcp payload they don t have therefore i created this tool such that these bytes don t appear at the start of a packet s payload instead they appear in the middle the idss look for these patterns both coming from the attacker and also coming from the server therefore i have to manipulate both sides of the connection in order to cause the evasion i do this on the client side by sending an http get request back to back with a heartbeat request this was the most difficult part of the program normally with an ssl api you let the underlying library take care of network and sockets communications for you however that creates two separate tcp packets on the wire when i want just one packet with two ssl records therefore i had to use my own sockets communications then use the openssl memory bio feature to encrypt and decrypt data separately there s not a lot of documentation on how to do this so it took a while to get it to work on the server side the replies naturally come back together i haven t tested anywhere but the cloudflare challenge server but i think this should almost always be the case my tool looks for and   and as the packet header and warns you when this is the case here are some ids links to the signatures in question the key features of all these rules is that they check for the pattern and   and at the start of a tcp payload which heartleech doens t generate sourcefire fox it emergingthreat suricata the bro intrusion detection system doesn t use snort rules but instead bases its detection on parsers hence it detect heartleech other people have different programs that do similar things to this i go the idea for searching for primes in a tweet from einar otto stangvik einaros he probably got that idea from others for example jeremi gosney jmgosney also successfully used the idea before i started coding it here are some links

9038128, cshell readme  cshell is an interactive c scripting environment it allows you to use c without any fluff right in a console like environment called a read eval print loop repl your code is directly evaluated and executed in a shell window no separate executable has to be compiled and then run in a different process more elaborate code can be written in a c script and then evaluated as one file only one line or a selection then your results can be easily dumped to html like linqpad or viewed as a data grid or plotted to a chart cshell is perfect to explore data and quickly drill deeper into information since you can write one line of code evaluate it check out the results and then write some more code evaluate it again and so forth if you just want to test one or two lines of c code without creating a new console project in visual studio just fire up cshell type the code you wanna test and you immediately can see if it works the way you want system requirements  cshell needs the net framework   installed supported windows versions windows     and vista sp windows xp is not supported how to build  to build visual studio  or higher is required open the solution and build the project or configure the build script in the and build folder to point to the right visual studio vcvarsall script for the first build some nuget packages have to be downloaded make sure you have nuget installed and package restore enabled tools options package manager package restore

36792007, this is an example of how to use the is module inside the esp to output sound in this case it is used to output decoded mp data actually more accurately mpeg layer iii data the code described here basically is a webradio streamer which can connect to an icecast server take the mp data the server sends out decode it and output it over the is bus to a dac the mp decoder has been tested for bitrates up to kbit and s and sample rates of up to khz all high level options can be configured in mp and user and playerconfig h edit that file to set up your access point and a webradio stream or other source of mp data served over http to build the code try running make sh in the mp and directory alternatively the way to use make to build this code is make compile gcc boot none app  spispeed  spimode qio spisize  the resulting binaries will be in the bin and folder please disregard the message that pops up at the end of the make process the addresses it mentions are wrong the correct addresses to load the resulting files are bin and eagle flash bin x bin and eagle iromtext bin xa if you want to have nice high quality buffered audio output you will need to connect two ics to your esp a kbyte spi ram and an is codec both ics are optional but you will get stuttering and low quality sound if you leave them the spi ram is a microchip lc part and is used to buffer the incoming mp data this guards against latency isuues that are present in all but the most quiet networks and closest connections it is connected to the same bus as the spi flash esp pin lc pin  gpio and cs  sdd so and si  sdd sio  gnd gnd  sdd si and sio  sdclk sck  sdd and hold and sio   v vcc  optional may also be connected to vcc on lc side one way to make these connections is to take the ssoic version of the lc bend up pin  and cs and piggyback it on the spi flash chip that already is on the esp module solder all the pins to the same pins on the spi flash chip except for the bent and cs pin use a wire to connect that to gpio as github user milkpirate correctly remarked gpio is also used to enter programming mode on the esp and will interfere with correct flashing if kept low the correct way of flashing the module is to make gpio low reset the esp to enter programming mode then make gpio high again tools like esptool py generally follow this method to automatically enter programming mode if you manually enter programming mode you may have to adjust your methodology for the is codec pick whatever chip or board works for you this code was written using a es chip but other is boards and chips will probably work as well the connections to make here are esp pin is signal  gpio and tx lrck gpio and rx data gpio bclk also don t forget to hook up any supply voltages and grounds needed to not use the spi ram chip please edit mp and user and playerconfig h and define fakespibuff this will use a much smaller buffer in the main memory of the esp because the buffer is much smaller the code will be very sensitive to network latency also clock synchronization with live streaming stations will not work expect the sound to cut out a fair amount of times unless you have a quiet network and connect to a server very close to you to not use an is dac chip please edit mp and user and playerconfig h and define pwmhack this uses some code to abuse the is module as a  bit pwm generator you can now connect an amplifier to the is data pin gpio and rx of the esp module connecting a speaker directly may also work but is not advised the gpios of the esp are not meant to drive inductive loads directly in the default configuration this code will output  bit mono audio stereo audio is possible but hasn t been implemented yet a stereo synth is available but has not been modified for esp use yet in pwm mode the output is a dithered  bit pwm output furthermore the esp can decode a pretty wide range of bitrates kbit to kbit mps have been tested and seem to work fine sound quality in general is not bad but the scaling and clock adaption algorithms can use some improvement if the decoder needs to output real high quality sound patches are welcome the mp example is a very memory sensitive piece of code the mp decoder uses almost all the ram and the needed buffers for input and output buffering take up the rest when using no external spi ram only a few bytes of memory are left the sdk libs that come with this example are libraries that have been optimized for memory usage and are known to work the biggest part of this code consists of a modified version of libmad a fixed point mp decoder the specific version we use here has already been modified by nxp to use less memory source www nxp com and documents and applicationnote and an pdf and has been massaged by espressif to store as much constants in flash as possible in order to decrease ram use even more the mp decoder is fed from a fifo realized in the external lc spi ram this ram is filled from a network socket in a separate thread on the output side the mp samples are fed into the is subsystem using dma the is dma basically consists of a circular buffer consisting of a number of smaller buffers as soon as the dma is done emptying one of the smaller buffers into the is subsystem it will fire an interrupt this interrupt will put the buffer address in a queue when the mp decoder has a bunch of samples ready it will pop a buffer off this queue and put the samples in it until it is full then take the next buffer etc the mp decoder generally is faster than the is output so at a certain moment there will be no free buffers left the queue system of freertos will suspend the mp decoding task when that happens allowing the esp to attend to other tasks while the esp is able to run at mhz we re leaving it at its default speed of mhz here it seems that at that speed the esp is perfectly capable of decoding even kbit mp data

3845165,   scott jehl filament group inc original idea from scott gonzalez download the production version min or the development version max to use add attributes to elements in your page where non essential fragments of content can be included from an external url using jquery api like qualifiers like data after data before data append and data replace note these attributes can be placed on any element not just anchors once the dom is ready you can apply the plugin like this data append  data replace  data after  data before ajaxinclude to include content based on a particular css media query you can add a data media attribute to the element that already has one of the ajax include data attributes specified above and give that attribute a value of any css media query the content of that include will only be requested and inserted into the page if and when that media query is valid which could happen at page load or later on after an orientation change or resize for example include the referenced fragment at viewport widths of em and up to include content when a user clicks on a link or submits a form use the data interaction attribute data interaction will block ajaxinclude from executing on this element until you explicitly remove it and subsequently call ajaxinclude a data interaction bind click  function this removeattr data interaction ajaxinclude return false see also hijaxinclude with forms readme plugins md to view some demos you can visit the following page in your browser or clone down this repo and browse to the test and functional and directory you ll need to be running a local web server for the ajax to work in most browsers note that the proxy demo page will not work at the above url because it needs to be run on a web server with php support data append  data replace  data after  data before ajaxinclude proxy quickconcat php wrap files note in prior versions ajaxinclude supported a single string argument for the proxy url this is currently deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming version also please don t edit files in the dist subdirectory as they are generated via grunt you ll find source code in the src subdirectory  copyright c  scottjehl filament group inc licensed under the mit license

1120129, and other development tools for in browser javascript and communicate with wide range of web browsers request for contributors  a lot of the contributors of this project are strapped for time and we could use some more motivation  from my experience an ability to use repl for javascript debugging and interactive development is very helpful when developing web applications previously i was using a heavily patched adapted for in browser javascript primary downsides of that approach were extreme instability of communication between emacs and the browser the lack of cross browser support and the lack of good rpc between emacs and js that can be used to develop some handy extensions project that provides such functionality for problem is that most of us including myself can t use lisp all the time and a lot of code needs to be developed using languages like plain javascript as opposed to parenscript  python and so on my first thought was to adapt slime proxy for use with plain js but then i decided to roll my own swank backend using node js i wanted to find out what this buzz around node js is about and perhaps steal an idea or two from there for use in my lisp projects another reason was some people may prefer firebug or built in browser development tools to emacs based development but for example in case of mobile browsers you don t have much choice at some point i did try swank js with an colleague s iphone and it worked which is not too unexpected given that socket io has good cross browser support as of now swank js provides repl with an ability to work with multiple browser connections supports dynamic updates of javascript code using c c c c and c m x provides debug output function and an ability to reload web pages in the browser or refresh their css using emacs commands many aspects of full fledged swank backends aren t implemented yet there s no debugger and completion and autodoc and so on but as i plan to use swank js a lot in future there s a good chance many of these features will be eventually added installation   install swank js from npm npm install g swank js was verified to work with slime    it may or may not work with other versions but note that breaking change in the protocol was introduced in slime    add it to your emacs add to list load path and path and to and js mode and directory autoload js mode js mode nil t add to list auto mode alist js js mode  create symbolic link to slime js el in the contrib subdirectory of slime project  in your emacs add the following lines you may use other key for slime js reload also if you re already using slime just add slime js to the list of contribs otherwise adjust the load path item global set key f slime js reload add hook js mode hook lambda slime js minor mode   if you re using css mode you may want to add the following lines too add hook css mode hook lambda define key css mode map m c x slime js refresh css define key css mode map c c c r slime js embed css if you want to use swank from the node project just add following to your package json file devdependencies swank js     scripts swank node nodemodules and swank js  once this is done you should be able to run up a swank for this project by npm run swank alternatively you can install swank js globally by running npm install g swank js once installed you could run it from you project directory swank js make slime connect to the backend using m x slime connect and specifying localhost and port  you will see repl buffer with the following prompt node this means that you re currently talking to node js you may play around with it by running some javascript expressions if you get warning about slime version mismatch you may make it disappear until the next slime upgrade by typing js slime version at the repl and entering your slime version e g    point your web browser to you will see the following message appear in the repl browser name and version may differ remote attached browser firefox      this means that the browser is now connected several browsers can connect simultaneously and you can switch between them and node js repl using select remote repl shortcut to use it press  comma and type select remote completion is supported you will see remote prompt press tab to see completions select your browser in the list by typing its name or clicking on the completion the following message will appear node remote selected browser firefox      firefox   after that you can interactively evaluate expressions in your browser to go back to node js repl switch back to node js and direct firefox   document body nodename firefox   alert test firefox   when working with browser you may use f to reload the page swank js connection with browser is lost in this case but to solve this problem you may use sticky select remote instead of select remote this way swank js will remember your selection and automagically attach to the browser whenever it connects if you press f after using sticky select remote  you will see that browser briefly disconnects but then connects again remote detached browser firefox      firefox   remote selected auto direct node js remote attached browser firefox      node remote selected auto browser firefox      firefox   the sticky remote selection is saved in the config file and swankjsrc so you don t need to do sticky select remote after restarting the now let s try to make it work with an actual site swank js acts as a proxy between your browser and the site so it can inject necessary script tags into html pages and avoid cross domain http request important otherwise it will redirect to www reddit com skipping the frontpage load if you didn t do select remote or sticky select remote yet do it now and select your browser from the list of remotes now you can execute javascript in the context of firefox   sitetable a title map function n return n and  and and this text get join n  wikileaks currently under a mass ddos attack  munich university jealous let s make a function from it create a file test js somewhere and make sure it uses js mode if it doesn t switch it to js mode using m x js mode type the following there function listreddittitles sitetable a title map function n swankjs output n and  and and this text and n get join n note swankjs output function being used there it allows you to send debug print to slime repl move the point somewhere into the middle of the listreddittitles function and press c m x now you may try it out in the repl firefox   listreddittitles  wikileaks currently under a mass ddos attack  munich university jealous you may edit the function definition and update it using c m x any number of times now let s try some css hacking create a directory named zzz and start a web server in it from your command prompt mkdir zzz cd zzz python msimplehttpserver create a file named a css there and make sure it uses css mode like with js mode you can force it with m x css mode add some css rules to this file body background green now let s add the stylesheet to the reddit page object object you will see some parts of the page become green now change green to blue in the css file and press c m x it will save the file automatically body background blue you will see the page become blue maybe after some flickering as all css used on the page is reloaded this way you may update css in an ajax application without reloading the page which is often rather handy unlike editing css in firebug in case when you re editing css of your own application changes will not disappear upon page reload with reddit page you ll have to readd the stylesheet alternatively to just try out a snippet of css you can select some css code and hit c c c r this will send the code snippet or the content of the whole buffer to the browser and embed it inside a style element to remove the embedded css run the command with a prefix c u c c c r this is useful for automatically connecting to a web page you develop locally without using the target url command and without changing the document url for that page when node swank js is running embed and you are ready to go you can bookmark href javascript function bswankjs disconnect b d b swank links and use them on any page you d like to play with when installed globally npm install g swank js you can connect another node js process to the swank js node process via require swank js and client and node setupnodejsclient optionally you can pass in swankserverhost and swankserverport as arguments to the setupnodejsclient

50825726, react armor  react armor is a collection of utilies to protect your react powered dom from third party tampering in a react app it is often crucial to make sure that the actual dom doesn t get changed behind your back so that the virtual dom and the actual dom stay in sync under your control enforcing your invariants however third party scripts often mess with your dom violating your invariants such third party scripts include browser extensions adblockers  userscripts invasive ads and many more most of these scripts hook into your dom using its tree structure and more specifically using css selectors to target your dom using either injected stylesheets plain document queryselector  not to mention react armor provides several tools to make hard if not impossible for any script not encapsulated in your react app to hook into your dom the tools are designed to be efficient easy to use and play very well with the rest of the react and js ecosystem most selectors are simply based on class names this tool makes class names determinist but cryptographically unpredictable making it practically impossible to target dom elements using class names selectors using react traverse the following js import obfuscateclassnames from react armor function bar obfuscateclassnames seed foobar class foo extends react component render renders to the following html we also provide a tool to apply the exact same transformation to your stylesheets so that you can keep writing css or css in jss as normal and keep everything working the following js import obfuscateclassnames from react armor postcss obfuscateclassnames createpostcssplugin seed foobar process foo bar attr val bar module hover background color red ul li bar module bar visited background color green generates the following css fb accc attr val faedd hover background color red ul li faedd accc visited background color green in order for this tool to be efficient at preventing css selectors to work you should change the seed often eg generate a new random seed automatically once a day or generate a new random seed at each request but this is costly since you must then regenerate your stylesheet once per request too preventing browser caching while most third party selectors rely on classes they can also target an element relying only on the tree structure of the dom especially if class based selectors have been crippled by using our first tool to also disable tree structure based selectors we rely on the fact that css selectors are poor at targeting subtrees of variable depth we created a react component obfuscator  which does precisely this it wraps nodes in variable length subtrees making it prohibitively costly and error prone to write the selectors which would always or even often target these subtrees the following js obfuscator seed fizzbuzz and obfuscator renders to the following html span span span span and span and div and div and div and span and span and span and div and div and span obfuscator works by inserting a random amount in a configurable interval of nodes every which of them is a random element either span or div by default also configurable you must also provide a seed which will be used by the internal prng to generate tree permutations the permutations are stateless which means they are not random but only very hard virtually impossible to predict and therefore don t change upon re rendering if the same seed is reused to avoid dom thrashing in order for this tool to be efficient at preventing css selectors to work you should change the seed often eg generate a new random seed automatically once a day or generate a new random seed at each request the strength s r a b of the obfuscator is the number of distinct selectors which must be generated to cover all the structures possibly generated by the algorithm if the seed is considered unpredictable with r allowedelements length a mindepth b maxdepth it resolves to s r a b sum r k k m n r b and  r a and r  for r   otherwise s  a b b a for example with the default values r  a b   then s r a b   which means that a third party selector would have to try and match up to  selectors unless of course you pollute the generated elements with easily matchable attributes such as predictible class names with a b   then s r a b   as expected which is a lot of selectors to generate allowedelements div  span an array of elements either string or component to pick from this is useful if you want to restrict extend or customize the elements injected by the obfuscator the length of this array impacts the strength of the obfuscator a lot one simple way to increase the strength of the obfuscator without nesting too many levels would be to use custom tag names not to be confused with full fledged html custom elements  eg allowedelements x obfuscator   x obfuscator   x obfuscator  however it is possible that using custom tag names can be detected by third party script as not being whitelisted as a standard tag name and it is therefore not used by default you should therefore use the tag names obfuscator instead injectedprops either a props object or a function that takes k depth type and returns the props object to inject into the generated element at depth k k  is outermost element k depth  is innermost component this is useful mostly for styling for example if you want to inject inline styles or class names which pairs nicely with the class name obfuscator above be careful though to not lose entropy by injecting predictible or matchable attributes such as class names it is safe however to introduce obfuscated class names using obfuscateclassnames to style the generated elements eg forcing display block or display inline block mindepth   maxdepth  the range of possible depths used by obfuscator this is useful if you want to trade obfuscator strength for dom weight note that the number of nodes generated is linear of maxdepth  while the strength is exponential of maxdepth  so unless you really think a few dozens of hundred extra dom nodes will impact performance more than these sneaky third party scripts then you should probably not decrease it all other props besides seed will be directly passed to the outermost element generated by obfuscator  eg classname  style  etc other than class names selectors are often based on tag names this tool makes tag names determinist but cryptographically unpredictable making it practically impossible to target dom elements using tag names selectors using react traverse the following js import obfuscatetagnames from react armor function bar obfuscatetagnames seed foobar class foo extends react component render renders to the following html ecb ecb class foo ecb ecb class bar bar and ecb ecb and ecb ecb we also provide a tool to apply the exact same transformation to your stylesheets so that you can keep writing css or css in jss as normal and keep everything working the following js import obfuscatetagnames from react armor postcss obfuscatetagnames createpostcssplugin seed foobar process div foo span bar attr val bar module hover iframe background color red ul li bar module bar visited p background color green generates the following css ecb ecb foo aca a bar attr val bar module hover iframe background color red ul li bar module bar visited ebb eb background color green note that by default certain elements such as iframe  h  etc see the source lib and obfuscatetagnames are never obfuscated so that special behaviour and seo and accessibility relevant tags are left untouched also the default style for the obfuscated elements are those of htmlunknownelement  which are usually very minimal you should therefore use either inline styles or better obfuscated class names to reset the style of each element in order for this tool to be efficient at preventing css selectors to work you should change the seed often eg generate a new random seed automatically once a day or generate a new random seed at each request but this is costly since you must then regenerate your stylesheet once per request too preventing browser caching other tools will probably come helping if you have ideas please feel free to contact me post an issue or submit a pr while each tool is independent there are best used together and pair nicely with each other the recommended way to apply tools is  use obfuscator inside your components wherever it makes sense  obfuscate class names at the top level  obfuscate tag names at the top level for example the following js const seed foobar and and change this automatically every once in a while eg once per day function bar obfuscator seed seed ul classname bar ul li classname bar ul li key a bar a and li li classname bar ul li key b bar b and li and ul and obfuscator and div class foo extends react component render h here be bar and h and div react render obfuscatetagnames seed obfuscateclassnames seed renders to the following html ecb ecb class fb h here be bar and h ecb ecb class accc ecb ecb ecb ecb ecb ecb ul class cfefd li class cafc bar a and li li class cafc bar b and

188029, hg git mercurial plugin  this is the hg git plugin for mercurial adding the ability to push and pull to and from a git server repository from hg this means you can collaborate on git based projects from hg or use a git server as a collaboration point for a team with developers using both git and hg the hg git plugin can convert commits and changesets losslessly from one system to another so you can push via an hg repository and another hg client can pull it and their changeset node ids will be identical mercurial data does not get lost in translation it is intended that hg users may wish to use this to collaborate even if no git users are involved in the project and it may even provide some advantages if you re using bookmarks see below dependencies  this plugin is implemented entirely in python there are no git binary dependencies you do not need to have git installed on your system the only dependencies are mercurial and dulwich see the makefile for information about which versions of mercurial are known to work and setup py for which versions of dulwich are required you can clone a git repository from hg by running hg clone url dest for example if you were to run hg clone git and and github com and schacon and hg git git hg git would clone the repository and convert it to an hg repository if you want to clone a github repository for later pushing or any other repository you access via ssh  you need to convert the ssh url to a format with an explicit protocol prefix for example the git url with push access git github com schacon and hg git git would read git and ssh and and git github com and schacon and hg git git mind the switch from colon to slash after the host your clone command would thus look like this hg clone git and ssh and and git github com and schacon and hg git git if you are starting from an existing hg repository you have to set up a git repository somewhere that you have push access to add a path entry for it in your hg and hgrc file and then run hg push name from within your repository for example cd hg git an hg repository edit hg and hgrc and add the target git url in the paths section hg push this will convert all your hg data into git objects and push them to the git server now that you have an hg repository that can push and pull to and from a git repository you can fetch updates with hg pull hg pull that will pull down any commits that have been pushed to the server in the meantime and give you a new head that you can merge in hg git can also be used to convert a mercurial repository to git you can use a local repository or a remote repository accessed via ssh http or https use the following commands to convert the repository it assumes you re running this in home mkdir git repo cd git repo git init cd cd hg repo hg bookmarks hg hg push and git repo the hg bookmark is necessary to prevent problems as otherwise hg git pushes to the currently checked out branch confusing git this will create a branch named hg in the git repository to get the changes in master use the following command only necessary in the first run later just use git merge or rebase cd git repo git checkout b master hg to import new changesets into the git repository just rerun the hg push command and then use git merge or git rebase in your git repository git cleanup  hg bookmarks integration  hg git pushes your bookmarks up to the git server as branches and will pull git branches down and set them up as bookmarks installing  clone this repository somewhere and make the extensions section in your and hgrc file look something like this extensions hggit path to and hg git and hggit that will enable the hg git extension for you see the makefile for a list of compatible mercurial versions configuration  git intree  hg git keeps a git repository clone for reading and updating by default the git clone is the subdirectory git in your local mercurial repository if you would like this git clone to be at the same level of your mercurial repository instead named git  add the following to your hgrc git intree true git authors  git uses a strict convention for author names when representing changesets using the form realname email address mercurial encourages this convention as well but is not as strict so it s not uncommon for a mercurial repo to have authors listed as for example simple usernames hg git by default will attempt to translate mercurial usernames using the following rules if the mercurial username fits the pattern name email  the git name will be set to name and the email to email if the mercurial username looks like an email if it contains an  the git name and email will both be set to that email if the mercurial username consists of only a name the email will be set to none none illegal characters stray s or s will be stripped out and for name email usernames any content after the right bracket for example a second will be turned into a url encoded sigil like ext e in the git author name since these default behaviors may not be what you want none none  for example shows up unpleasantly on github as illegal email address  the git authors option provides for an authors translation file that will be used during outgoing transfers from mercurial to git only by modifying hgrc as such git authors authors txt where authors txt is the name of a text file containing author name translations one per each line using the following format johnny john smith jsmith foo com dougie doug johnson dougiej bar com empty lines and lines starting with a are ignored it should be noted that this translation is on the hg git side only changesets coming from git back to mercurial will not translate back into hg usernames so it s best that the same username and email combination be used on both the hg and git sides the author file is mostly useful for translating legacy changesets git branchbookmarksuffix  hg git does not convert between mercurial named branches and git branches as the two are conceptually different instead it uses mercurial bookmarks to represent the concept of a git branch therefore when translating an hg repo over to git you typically need to create bookmarks to mirror all the named branches that you d like to see transferred over to git the major caveat with this is that you can t use the same name for your bookmark as that of the named branch and furthermore there s no feasible way to rename a branch in mercurial for the use case where one would like to transfer an hg repo over to git and maintain the same named branches as are present on the hg side the branchbookmarksuffix might be all that s needed this presents a string suffix that will be recognized on each bookmark name and stripped off as the bookmark is translated to a git branch git branchbookmarksuffix bookmark above if an hg repo had a named branch called releasemaintenance  you could then link it to a bookmark called releasemaintenancebookmark hg git will then strip off the bookmark suffix from this bookmark name and create a git branch called releasemaintenance when pulling back from git to hg the bookmark suffix is then applied back if and only if an hg named branch of that name exists e g  when changes to the releasemaintenance branch are checked into git these will be placed into the releasemaintenancebookmark bookmark on hg but if a new branch called releasemaintenance were pulled over to hg and there was not a releasemaintenance named branch already the bookmark will be named releasemaintenance with no usage of the suffix the branchbookmarksuffix option is like the authors option intended for migrating legacy hg named branches going forward an hg repo that is to be linked with a git repo should only use bookmarks for named branching git mindate  if set branches where the latest commit s commit time is older than this will not be imported accepts any date formats that mercurial does see hg help dates for more git similarity  specify how similar files modified in a git commit must be to be imported as mercurial renames or copies as a percentage between  disabled and  files must be identical for example  means that a delete and add pair will be imported as a rename if more than  of the file has stayed the same the default is  disabled git renamelimit  the number of files to consider when performing the copy and rename detection detection is disabled if the number of files modified in a commit is above the limit detection is o n  in the number of files modified so be sure not to set the limit too high similar to git s diff renamelimit config the default is   the same as git git findcopiesharder  whether to consider unmodified files as copy sources this is a very expensive operation for large projects so use it with caution similar to git diff s find copies harder option

1683042, sprite factory v    the sprite factory is a ruby library that can be used to generate individual image files from a directory into a single unified sprite image and creates an appropriate css stylesheet for use in your web application the library provides both a ruby api and a command line script many customizable options support for any css selector style including hover pseudo class selectors support for pngcrush n the generated image file compatible with rails   asset pipeline installation  gem install sprite factory an image library is also required spritefactory comes with built in support for rmagick is the most common image libary to use installation instructions for ubuntu sudo aptitude install imagemagick libmagickwand dev sudo gem install rmagick chunkypng is lighter weight but only supports png format gem install chunkypng spritefactory can also be easily extended to use the image library of your choice use the sf command line script specifying the location of your images sf images and icons this will combine the individual image files within that directory and generate images and icons png images and icons css you can also use the spritefactory class directly from your own code require spritefactory spritefactory run images and icons the original image file name is used for the css class to show that image in html if original image files are included in sub folders the relative path name will be used for the css class to show that image in html when using a framework such as rails you would usually dry this up with a helper method def spritetag name imagetag s gif  class name note s gif is the traditional name of a x pixel transparent gif used as a dummy src when the true image comes from a css background attribute technically for css sprites you could just use a div with a class instead of an img  but customization  much of the behavior can be customized by overriding the following options layout specify layout algorithm horizontal vertical or packed style specify stylesheet syntax css scss or sass library specify image library to use rmagick or chunkypng selector specify custom css selector see below cssurl specify custom css url see below outputimage specify output location for generated image default lt input folder gt png outputstyle specify output location for generated stylesheet default lt input folder gt lt style gt pngcrush pngcrush the generated output image if pngcrush is available padding add padding to each sprite margin add margin to each sprite width fix width of each sprite to a specific size height fix height of each sprite to a specific size nocss suppress generation of output stylesheet run returns css content as a string instead nocomments suppress generation of comments in output stylesheet sanitizer strip non word characters from image filenames when generating css selectors options can be passed as command line arguments to the sf script sf images and icons style sass layout packed options can also be passed as the nd argument to the run method spritefactory run images and icons  style sass layout packed you can see the results of many of these options by viewing the sample page that comes with the gem in test and images and reference and index html note only the common options are available via the command line script to keep it simple specifically the advanced width  height  and nocss options are only available via the ruby interface note the width  height and padding options are not particularly useful you would be better off just making your source images have the correct dimensions by editing them appropriately in photoshop or your editor of choice note the margin option is used primarily to buffer each image in the generated sprite with px margin to avoid images bleeding into each other when the browser needs to scale them e g when user increases and decreases font size the generated image can be laid out in a horizontal or a vertical strip by providing a layout option defaults to horizontal a new option in v   is to use a packed layout which will attempt to generate an optimized packed square ish layout for more details on the bin packing algorithm used customizing the css selector  elements for your sprites and that the basename of each individual file is suitable for use as a css classname for example the following files images and icons and high png images and icons and medium png images and icons and low png when run with spritefactory run images and icons will generate the following css img high width px height px background url images and icons png px px no repeat img medium width px height px background url images and icons png px px no repeat img low width px height px background url images and icons png px px no repeat if you want to use different selectors for your rules you can provide the selector option for spritefactory run images and icons  selector span icon will generate span iconhigh width px height px background url images and icons png px px no repeat span iconmedium width px height px background url images and icons png px px no repeat span iconlow width px height px background url images and icons png px px no repeat customizing the css selector per image  if you want to specify a custom selector for each individual image then name the image files accordingly the library will map   double underscore to a single space in any source image filename for example images and icons and div foospan iconalert png images and icons and div barspan iconalert png when run with spritefactory run images and icons  selector div example will generate div example div foo span iconalert first file div example div bar span iconalert second file if you want to specify a psuedo class such as hover for some of your images the library will also map double dash to a colon in any source image filename for example images and icons and alert png images and icons and alert hover png when run with spritefactory run images and icons  selector span icon will generate span iconalert first file span iconalert hover second file sanitizing the css selector  if your image filenames contain non word characters that would otherwise invalidate your css selector you can sanitize these characters using the sanitizer option for example images and icons and has ampersand png images and icons and odd period png images and icons and ends with bang png when run with spritefactory run images and icons  sanitizer true will generate span iconhasampersand first file span iconoddperiod second file span iconendswithbang third file if you want full control over the filename to selector sanitization process you can provide a custom sanitizer for example images and icons and foo png images and icons and bar png when run with spritefactory run images and icons  sanitizer lamda and name and name reverse pointless but amusing will generate span iconoof first file span iconrab second file customizing the css image url  within the generated css file it can be tricky to get the correct path to your unified sprite image for example you might be hosting your images on amazon s or if you are building a ruby on rails application you might need to generate url s using the imagepath helper method to ensure it gets the appropriate cache busting query parameter by default the spritefactory generates simple url s that contain the basename of the unified sprite image e g spritefactory run icons generates url icons png but you can control the generation of these url s using the cssurl option for most cdn s you can prepend a simple string to the image name spritefactory run icons  for more control a simple token replacement can be performed using the image token for example to generate calls spritefactory run icons  cssurl image url image generates image url icons png for full control you can provide a lambda function and generate your own values spritefactory run icons  cssurl lambda and image and url imagepath image generates url and path and to and my and images and icons png v note the cssurl option replaces csspath from earlier versions the previous option only let you customize the path inside of the generated url  while this new option allows you to customize the entire value including the outer url itself customizing the entire css output  if you want complete control over the generated styles you can pass a block to the run method the block will be provided with information about each image including the generated css attributes whatever content the block returns will be inserted into the generated css file spritefactory run images and timer do and images and rules rules div running img button cursor pointer images running style rules div stopped img button cursor pointer images stopped style rules join n the images argument is a hash where each key is the basename of an image file and the value is a hash of image metadata that includes the following style the default generated style cssx the css sprite x position cssy the css sprite y position cssw the css sprite width cssh the css sprite height x the image x position y the image y position width the image width height the image height note the image coords can differ form the css sprite coords when padding and margin or fixed width and height options are specified using sprite factory with the rails asset pipeline  the sprite factory gem plays nice with the rails asset pipeline with a few simple steps add the sprite factory to your gemfile including your chosen image library dependency group

55813505, this project which implements a minimal blog commenting service blog posts it is completely serverless  designed to use the following amazon services additionally we use apex to simplify the uploading of the lambda functions without the shim it should cost very little to run the following resources are provisioned you will need os x linux bsd or another unix based os scripts will need some modifications for windows git clone git github com jimpick and lambda comments git git cd lambda comments npm run install all runs npm install in top directory and then sets up sub packages under packages copy env sample to env and customize it cp env sample env the default env sample contains cloudformation myblogcomments region us west  stage prod configure the project by setting environment variables blog the full base url of the blog and website cloudformation the name of the cloudformation stack region the aws region stage the api gateway stage to create slack optional slack webhook configure this if you want a notification in a slack channel each time a comment is posted for now follow the step by step instructions below in the future we will develop a streamlined installation procedure npm run create cloudformation the command returns immediately but it will take a while to complete typically   minutes it s a good idea to watch the cloudformation task in the aws web console to ensure that it completes without errors note when working with the cloudformation recipe you can also use npm run update cloudformation and npm run delete cloudformation npm run save cloudformation this will create a file in deploy and state and cloudformation json cloudformation has issues setting the runtime to nodejs   see until cloudformation is updated here s an extra step to update the lambda functions to use node js   using a custom script npm run flip lambdas to   npm run gen api key this will create a file in deploy and state and apikey json containing an apikey variable that will be baked into the client to sign requests the purpose of the api key is to try to minimize spam to the api but as the api key is distributed publicly as part of the javascript it s only there to stop non sophisticated spammers who don t care enough to extract the api key and sign their requests npm run setup apex this generates build and apex and project json npm run compile lambda this will use webpack and babel to compile the source code in src and server and lambdafunctions into build and apex and functions the webpack configuration is in deploy and apex and webpack config es js npm run deploy lambda this will run apex deploy in the build and apex directory to upload the compiled lambda functions alternatively if you want to execute the compile and deploy steps in one command you can run npm run deploy backend npm run build frontend this builds the code in the packages and frontend directory npm run upload script this will copy lambda comments js to the s bucket alternatively if you want to execute the compile and deploy steps in one command you can run npm run deploy frontend if you want to deploy the backend and frontend all in one step you can use npm run deploy npm run test this will run both the local tests and remote test which test the deployed api and lambda functions the local tests can be run as npm run test local  and the remote tests can be run as npm run test remote currently the test suite expects some data to pre exist in the s bucket until the tests are properly mocked they will fail unless the data is created you can tail the cloudwatch logs npm run logs this just executes apex logs f in build and apex first get the url for the script npm run get client js url this will return a url you will use below eg and and s us west  amazonaws com and myblogcomments websites ttpkphgr and lambda comments js in the target web page perhaps a blog generated by a static site generator such as jekyll or hugo  add the following html to insert the comments from the development server into the page providing that the webpage is located at the web address matching the blog setting in the env configuration file the comments form should

3350798, rotatinglight this library is no longer maintained rotatinglight spacepen is a powerful but minimalistic client side view framework for coffeescript it combines the view and controller into a single jquery object whose markup is expressed with an embedded dsl similar to markaby for this version of spacepen depends on html  custom elements to support lifecycle hooks that previously depended on all dom manipulation being performed via jquery the afterattach and beforeremove hooks have been replaced with attached and detached and their semantics have been altered if you need to use spacepen in an environment that doesn t support custom elements consider using the previous major version or switching frameworks view objects extend from the view class and have a content class method where you express their html contents with an embedded markup dsl coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content div h spacecraft ol li apollo li soyuz li space shuttle views descend from jquery s prototype so when you construct one you can call jquery methods on it just as you would a dom fragment created with coffeescript view new spacecraft view find ol append li star destroyer and li view on click  li  alert they clicked on this text but spacepen views are more powerful than normal jquery fragments because they let you define custom methods coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content addspacecraft name find ol append li name and li view new spacecraft view addspacecraft enterprise you can also pass arguments on construction which get passed to both the content method and the view s constructor coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content params div h params title ol li name for name in params spacecraft view new spacecraft title space weapons  spacecraft tie fighter  death star  warbird methods from the jquery prototype can be gracefully overridden using super coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content hide console log hiding spacecraft list super if you override the view class s constructor ensure you call super alternatively you can define an initialize method which the constructor will call for you automatically with the constructor s arguments coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content initialize params title params title spacepen will automatically create named reference for any element with an outlet attribute for example if the ol element has an attribute outlet list  the view object will have a list entry pointing to a jquery wrapper for the ol element coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content div h spacecraft ol outlet list  li apollo li soyuz li space shuttle addspacecraft name list append li name and li elements can also have event name attributes whose value references a custom method for example if a button element has an attribute click launchspacecraft  then spacepen will invoke the launchspacecraft method on the button s parent view when it is clicked coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content div h spacecraft ol li click launchspacecraft  saturn v launchspacecraft event element console log preparing element name for launch as you ve seen so far the markup dsl is pretty straightforward from the content class method or any method it calls just invoke instance methods named for the html tags you want to generate there are  types of arguments you can pass to a tag method strings the string will be html escaped and used as the text contents of the generated tag hashes the key value pairs will be used as the attributes of the generated tag functions bound with the function will be invoked in between the open and closing tag to produce the html element s contents if you need to emit a non standard tag you can use the tag name args method to name the tag with a string coffeescript tag bubble  type speech  text string emits the html escaped string as text wherever it is called raw string passes the given string through unescaped use this when you need to emit markup directly that was generated beforehand subviews are a great way to make your view code more modular the subview name view method takes a name and another view object the view object will be inserted at the location of the call and a reference with the given name will be wired to it from the parent view a parentview reference will be created on the subview pointing at the parent coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content params div subview launchcontroller  new launchcontroller countdown params countdown h spacecraft  you don t need a view class to use the spacepen markup dsl call view render with an unbound function  not that calls tag methods and it will return a document fragment for ad hoc use this method is also assigned to the global variable for convenience coffeescript view list append text starship em enterprise you can retrieve the view object for any dom element by calling view on it this usually shouldn t be necessary as most dom manipulation will take place within the view itself using outlet references but is occasionally helpful coffeescript view new spacecraft body append view li view view the initialize method is always called when the view is still a detached dom fragment before it is appended to the dom this is usually okay but occasionally you ll have some initialization logic that depends on the view actually being on the dom for example you may depend on applying a css rule before measuring an element s height for these situations use the attached hook it will be called whenever your element is actually attached to the dom past versions of spacepen would also call this hook when your element was attached to another detached node but that behavior is no longer supported to be notified when your element is detached from the dom implement the detached hook coffeescript class spacecraft extends view content attached console log with css applied my height is  height detached console log i have been detached cd space pen npm install npm start

and and   and  and  and  and   and  and  and  and  and in less than a minute you can add gravatars to your ruby project it works in rails merb sinatra sudo gem install gravtastic for this example i m going to assume you are using rails don t worry if you aren t the concepts are still the same first off add this to your gemfile gem gravtastic next in your model class user activerecord base include gravtastic gravtastic small note you can use either isgravtastic  isgravtastic or hasgravatar  they all do the same thing  and small and you are done in your views you can now use the gravatarurl method on instances of user imagetag user gravatarurl gravatar gives you some options you can use them like this imagetag user gravatarurl rating r  secure true that will show r rated gravatars over a secure connection if you find yourself using the same options over and over again you can set the gravatar defaults in your model just change the isgravtastic line to something like this gravtastic secure true filetype gif size  now all your gravatars will come from a secure connection be a gif and be xpx gravatar needs an email address to find the person s avatar by default gravtastic calls the email method to find this you can customise this gravtastic authoremail a common question is how do i detect wether the user has an avatar or not people usually write code to perform a http request to gravatar to see wether the gravatar exists this is certainly a solution but not a very good one if you have page where you show  users the client will have to wait for  http requests before they even get the page slooww the best way to do this is to set the default option when using gravatarurl if the user doesn t have an avatar gravatar essentially redirects to the default url you provide table width  thead th option and th th description and th th default and th th values th gravatar is really just simple ruby there is no special magic which ties it to one orm like activerecord or mongomapper you can use the following pattern to include it anywhere require gravtastic class myclass include gravtastic isgravtastic class person include mongomapper document include gravtastic isgravtastic key email and wallah it s exactly the same as with activerecord now all instances of the person class will have gravatarurl methods note the gravatarurl methods don t get included until you specify the class isgravtastic  note this feature requires rails   coffeescript  web applications are increasingly performing client side rendering in javascript it s not always practical or clean to calculate the gravatarurl on the server as of version   gravtastic comes bundled with javascript helpers if you are using rails   you can simple require gravtastic in your gemfile and add and and require gravtastic in your application js file this will include a function gravtastic which performs similarly to gravtasticurl gravtastic christopher lloyd gmail com gravtastic christopher lloyd gmail com  default identicon  size  gravtastic is a mature project there isn t any active work which needs to be done on it but i do continue to maintain it just don t expect same day fixes if you

28170986, ambidex brings together the best of a bunch other fantastic projects including ambidex has been tested on iojs v   npm v   it should also work on node v   with the harmony flag but no promises ambidex is a work in progress it is the foundation of our web centric work in the ebay mobile innovation lab but it has not yet been deployed in production this architecture has two advantages  your data platform is capable of supporting any client including native mobile apps or those of third parties  your app can access data directly from the browser so it doesn t waste server cycles requesting largely redundant html on every page load here s how you instantiate ambidex javascript new ambidex settings require and settings process env nodeenv js  middlewareinjector function stack and and if you want to edit your mach stack for instance and and to serve static files with mach file do that here  ambidex notice that the ambidex constructor returns a promise this promise will be resolved when your app is serving as expected each ambidex instance has three public properties each instance of ambidex starts with a settings dictionary here are the individual settings supported the name your app will be referred to in the logs my awesome app a variation of that name without spaces or capital letters your app will appear in process monitors like top under this name myawesomeapp the hostname that your app will be made available at example appspot com the port that goes in your browser s address bar  if your app is behind a load balancer this is the port that ambidex should serve your app so the load balancer can find it  if your app is behind displayed inside a tardisgallery  mount its route tree here this allows you to serve different variations of your app alongside one another for instance you might serve version a at and a and and version b at and b and this string gets put in between section titles ambidexmixinstitle  such as for instance and static and logo svg in order to make your app ambidextrous we need to know where certain files are kept the values in this dictionary answer that question all the other filesystempaths are relative to this one if you set this to dirname no quotes  they will be relative to your settings file the module at this path should export the root route of your route tree if you d like to override those defaults simply point filesystempaths styles your own css file this module should export a dictionary of funx definitions e g javascript module exports apidefinitions bikes require and apis and bikes js   storedefinitions stateful bikes require and stores and bikes js    ephemeral currentbike function bikes routerstate return routerstate has bikeid bikes getorfetch  bikeid routerstate get bikeid   null  readytorender function routerstate currentbike if routerstate has bikeid currentbike return false return true    when enablehotmodulereplacement is false e g in production  ambidex will run webpack on all your files and serve the results inline in every response to do so it need to be able to cache them on the filesystem bundles should resolve to a folder where it can store these files each instance of ambidex needs its own unique bundles folder  this is an array of module names that should be ignored by webpack because they are not compatible with the browser and will only ever run on the server for instance jsdom settings is just a dictionary you can put any values inside it that you find useful for instance you might add staticurl so your components know which cdn hosts your static assets however as ambidex evolves so too will the available settings to ensure new features don t collide with your app specific inclusions put any settings that ambidex won t consume in settings customsettings remember because your routes need to be compiled to javascript source code to be run on the client anything you put in here needs to survive json serialization of course you ll need different settings for your production server than you will for your local machine but nobody wants to maintain the same information in many places therefore it s a common pattern to have a separate settings file for each environment you ll need and one more that holds everything that they all share for instance a professional project that utilizes many environments might be organized like this settings development js settings integration js settings qa js settings production js there are subtle differences between the ways the client and server operate we need to abstract them out to make your app ambidextrous that s what these mix ins are for when your route tree renders ambidex will check each handler for a section title settings titleseparator settingstitleseparator will be interspersed between each section title the result will be returned in the title tag when rendered on the server or set on the client with document title the biggest difference between running your app on the server and running it on the client is how you load data when someone clicks a link the server only gets to respond once so it must wait until every piece of data has loaded before responding the client doesn t have this limitation and users expect it to respond immediately the best strategy here is to change pages immediately even though your stores are probably empty and to fill the component with new data as it arrives the first challenge to overcome is knowing which data needs to be loaded for a particular page to be rendered the server only knows which page to show by inspecting the url it can also use the url determine which data to load javascript path and bikes and bikeid and edit and name editbike handler require and bike index and components and bikedetails jsx you must provide an ephemeral store called readytorender that listens returns true when all your data dependencies are loaded and ready to be handed to the client see an example of using routerstate and creating a readytorender store in the funxdefinitions settingsfilesystempathsrefluxactionsforrouterstate section now that you ve sorted out what data needs to be loaded you need to pass it to your react components the best way is with ambidex mixincreators connectstorestolocalstate storenames it will listen to the specified stores and persist their most recent values on your component s state whenever a store updates your component will too if you d rather do it manually you can instead use ambidex mixins funx  which adds getfunxaction and getfunxstore methods to your components
37074194, wondering where all the content was going to look was restructured into single packages as support for react native was added having single packages and some common files that are shared by both helps to keep the code documentation clean while still having the ability to manage issues and feature requests for both packages in a single repository this package targets react dom working with the web this is the package you need to use it supports both client side and server side rendering it uses css under the hood which allows us to use pseudo classes and media queries by default this package contains several test utilities for react look this package targets react native with no css support this package uses a different way to achieve the benefits of dynamic component styling while the core modules and styling mechanism of both packages are totally different we still try to achieve an universal api both use the exact same api except for the package names if you ve already learned to use one you can use the other one without additional effort i will not answer usage questions as issues but close them directly

25670347, these old bash scripts are now deprecated and no longer maintained instead use my new and improved ruby based tools available at utilities to transcode inspect and convert videos even if you don t use any of these scripts you may find their source code or this readme document helpful the primary script is transcode video sh and i wrote it because the preset system built into handbrake wasn t quite powerful enough to automatically change bitrate and other encoding options based on different inputs plus handbrake s default presets themselves didn t produce what i wanted in terms of predictable output size with sufficient quality input resolution and target video bitrate and p or blu ray video and  mbps p and  mbps i p or dvd video and  mbps these targets are technically maximum bitrates but since this script modifies cvbr mode with a minimum quality threshold x is allowed to exceed these bitrate limits to maintain that quality level however the final output video bitrate is still usually below or near the target and almost always below the target when additional compression is applied via x s preset system which makes videos transcoded with this script very near the same size quality and configuration as those from the itunes store including their audio tracks if possible audio is first passed through in its original form this hardly ever works for blu ray discs but it often will for dvds and other random videos since this script can take almost any movie file as input input channels and pass through and aac track and ac  track and and and mono and aac only and  kbps and none stereo and aac only and  kbps and none surround and ac  only up to  kbps and  kbps and  kbps with   channels the surround pass through bitrate is  kbps because this is common on dvds and re encoding that at  kbps could degrade quality additionally the transcode video sh script automatically burns any forced subtitle track it detects into the output video track burning means that the subtitle becomes part of the video itself and isn t retained as a separate track a forced subtitle track is detected by a special flag on that track in the input however automatic forced subtitle detection only works when the input is a single file and not a disc image directory most automatic behaviors in this script can be overridden or augmented with additional options but other than specifying cropping bounds using transcode video sh can be as simple as this transcode video sh and path and to and movie mkv which creates after what is hopefully a reasonable amount of time two files in the current working directory movie mp movie mp log one transcoding option i usually add on the command line is cropping bounds and i wrote the detect crop sh script because this can t be done safely with an automatic behavior in transcode video sh removing the black non content borders of a video during transcoding is not about making the edges of the output look pretty those edges are usually not visible anyway when viewed full screen cropping is about faster transcoding and higher quality fewer pixels to read and write almost always leads to a speed improvement fewer pixels also means the x encoder within handbrake doesn t waste bitrate on non content and sometimes handbrake only crops a few pixels from one or more edges which is too small of a difference in size to improve performance or quality this is why transcode video sh doesn t allow handbrake to apply cropping by default instead the detect crop sh script leverages both handbrake and mplayer with additional measurements and constraints to find the optimal video cropping bounds it then indicates whether those two programs agree to aid in review this script prints commands to the terminal console allowing the recommended or disputed crop to be displayed as well as sample command lines for transcode video sh itself and it s this easy to use detect crop sh and path and to and movie mkv which prints out something like this detecting and path and to and movie mkv scanning with handbrakecli scanning with mplayer scanning with mplayer scanning with mplayer scanning with mplayer scanning with mplayer results are identical mplayer really quiet nosound vf rectangle     and path and to and movie mkv mplayer really quiet nosound vf crop     and path and to and movie mkv transcode video sh crop     and path and to and movie mkv just copy and paste the sample commands to preview or transcode when input is a disc image directory instead of a single file the detect crop sh script does not use mplayer nor does it print out commands to preview the crop transcode video sh mkv crop     and path and to and movie mkv which creates these two files in the current working directory movie mkv movie mkv log but sometimes i like to play my videos on my iphone or ipad and those devices work best with mp format so i wrote the convert video sh script to repackage my videos into the other format without re transcoding them and it can work both ways matroska to mp or vice versa convert video sh movie mkv which creates this mp file in the current working directory movie mp convert video sh movie mp which creates this matroska file in the current working directory movie mkv this script requires a properly organized file in either format with compatible video and audio tracks most output video files from transcode video sh meet this criteria but videos from other sources can sometimes fail subtitle tracks are not converted all of these scripts work on os x because that s the platform where i develop test and use them but none of them actually require os x so technically they should also work on windows and linux your mileage may vary handbrake can also be downloaded and installed

installing ffmpeg is a bit more complicated due to recent changes in its homebrew formula brew install with faac with fdk aac ffmpeg to install both homebrew cask and handbrakecli  the command line version of handbrake brew install caskroom and cask and brew cask brew cask install handbrakecli nightly builds of handbrake are also available while often containing more up to date libraries these versions of handbrake are not always stable use them with caution to install both homebrew cask and a nightly build of handbrakecli brew install caskroom and cask and brew cask brew cask install caskroom and versions and handbrakecli nightly you can find the official release of handbrakecli here or a nightly build of handbrakecli here whichever version you choose make sure you download a disk image file containing the command line tool handbrakecli  and not just the handbrake application disk images containing handbrakecli have cli in the filename open the disk image and then copy handbrakecli to a directory listed in your path environment variable such as and usr and local and bin as of now all of my scripts must be installed manually you can retrieve them via the command line by cloning the entire repository like this or download them individually from the github website here make sure each script is executable by setting its permissions like this chmod and x transcode video sh and then copy the scripts to a directory listed in your path environment variable such as and usr and local and bin all of these scripts can take a single video file as their only argument transcode video sh and path and to and movie mkv use help to understand how to override their default behavior with other options transcode video sh help this built in help is available even if a script s software dependencies are not yet installed while transcode video sh and detect crop sh work best with a single video file both also accept a disc image directory as input transcode video sh and path and to and movie disc image directory and disc image directories are unencrypted backups of blu ray discs or dvds typically these formats include more than one video title these additional titles can be bonus features alternate versions of a movie multiple tv show episodes etc by default the first title in a disc image directory is selected for transcoding or crop detection sometimes this is what you want but most of the time it ll be the wrong choice if you know the title number you want e g title number   you can specify it with the title option transcode video sh title  and path and to and movie disc image directory and but usually you need to scan the disk image first to find the correct title number scanning is done by using special title number  transcode video sh title  and path and to and movie disc image directory and all the titles in the disc image directory are then listed along with other useful information like duration and format so you can identify exactly which title you want before using transcode video sh or any manual transcoding system consider these four alternatives upside often cheaper than buying physical media like blu ray discs and dvds upside much easier to store and catalog than physical media upside usually playable on mobile devices downside even with shopping around you probably won t find everything you want online downside video and audio quality of online formats are nowhere close to that of blu ray discs downside online formats usually don t have the breadth of bonus content available on physical media  watch your existing collection of blu ray discs and dvds on a hardware disc player upside no doubt you bought a player when you bought the discs upside a hardware disc player is the best vehicle for viewing bonus content and interactive features downside players are noisy cumbersome and cluttered with warnings trailers and other crap to keep you away from promptly watching your videos downside shuffling discs back and forth from their cases to the player is tedious and risks damage to the original media upside retains original high quality video and audio upside ripping is usually necessary for transcoding anyway upside easy to install configure and use upside automatically adjusts transcoding quality and size for different devices downside requires a powerful enough computer somewhere on your network to act as the server and do the actual real time transcoding downside dynamic transcoding can produce noticeable quality defects in some videos i have four rules when preparing my own media for transcoding  rip each selected video as a single matroska format mkv file  look for forced subtitles and isolate them in their own track why makemkv it runs on most desktop computer platforms like os x windows and linux there s even a free version available to try before you buy it was designed to decrypt and extract a video track usually the main feature of a disc and convert it into a single matroska format mkv file and it does this really really well it can also make an unencrypted backup of your entire blu ray or dvd to a disc image directory it s not pretty and it s not particularly easy use but once you figure out how it works you can rip your video exactly the way you want why a single mkv file many automatic behaviors and other features in both transcode video sh and detect crop sh are not available when input is a disc image directory this is because that format limits the ability of handbrakecli to detect or manipulate certain information about the video both forced subtitle extraction and lossless audio conversion detailed below are not possible when input is a disc image directory why bother with forced subtitles forced subtitles are often embedded within a full subtitle track and a special flag is set on the portion of that track which is supposed to be forced makemkv can recognize that flag when it converts the video into a single mkv file it can even extract just the forced portion of that subtitle into a another separate subtitle track and it can set a different forced flag in the output mkv file on that separate track so other software can tell what it s for not all discs with forced subtitles have those subtitles embedded within other tracks sometimes they really are separate but enough discs are designed with the embedded technique that you should avoid using a disc image directory as input for transcoding why convert lossless audio the x video encoder within handbrake provides either a specific video bitrate or a constant rate factor crf to control how bits are allocated using a specific video bitrate while encoding in one pass through the input is known as average bitrate abr mode it s called an average because a single pass can only approximate the target bitrate although it usually comes very close abr mode creates output of predictable size with unpredictable quality versions of transcode video sh prior to   used a modified abr mode that improved quality by allowing the bitrate to vary much much more this was done by setting x s rate tolerance how much it allows bitrate to vary to the highest possible or infinite value this was known as the ratetol inf hack about  of the time this modified abr mode hack worked very well but there were some cases where it performed poorly producing noticeable quality defects using a constant rate factor is known as variable bitrate vbr mode a rate factor is basically an arbitrary number targeting a constant level of quality the x default crf value is  lower values increase quality and bitrate higher values lower quality and bitrate but because the target is a quality level bitrate always varies significantly depending on input vbr mode creates output of predictable quality with unpredictable size version   of transcode video sh switched to using a constrained variable bitrate cvbr mode this mode set a specific upper limit on bitrate so that it behaved a bit like abr mode and that limit wasn t exceeded even when a higher level of quality was selected via the crf value of  this constraint was imposed by using x s video buffer verifier vbv system normally this system is used for bandwidth constrained situations such as streaming video using the vbv system typically means providing two parameters to x the first is the maximum rate and the second is the buffer size the maximum rate is the constraint typically the buffer size is set to the same value but when the maximum rate is a low bitrate as used by transcode video sh  then a buffer size of the same value will cause a noticeable quality defect with some input this particular defect usually manifests itself in flat grainy areas of the input so that it appears as if these areas are going in and out of focus it s very annoying version   of transcode video sh eliminated this defect by setting the vbv buffer size to half that of the maximum rate i discovered this almost by accident and still have no idea why the trick works about  of the time this cvbr mode worked very well it was a significant improvement over the older modified abr mode hack but there were a few cases where cvbr mode performed poorly producing other noticeable quality defects these other defects were caused by the hard upper limit on bitrate to correctly transcode some input sometimes you need a bigger bitrate additionally even a crf value of  wasn t high enough quality bitrates were too low in some cases which didn t cause defects so much as a loss of detail when compared to the original current versions of transcode video sh modify cvbr mode to impose a minimum quality threshold so that x is allowed to exceed bitrate limits to maintain that quality level this new constraint is simply a maximum crf value of  additionally the target crf value has been lowered to  together maximum bitrate and maximum crf essentially vie for control of the final output video bitrate with the target crf value doing its best to make helpful suggestions what should be chaos turns out beautifully even though x spews the occasional vbv underflow error it can be safely ignored this means the vbv maximum bitrate becomes a target bitrate when combined with a maximum crf value while the final output video bitrate is still usually below or near the target it can sometimes get larger on very rare occasions it can even be more than twice the target don t panic when additional compression is applied via x s preset system the output bitrate is almost always below or near the target if you don t want to apply additional compression to guarantee bitrates are below the target and you re willing to sacrifice some quality in exchange for size then you could raise both the crf and maximum crf values transcode video sh crf  crf max  and path and to and movie mkv this is essentially what the experimental hq option introduced in version   of transcode video sh did that option is now deprecated superseded by the new defaults changing any of these rate control options has to be done very carefully and i don t recommend it use the defaults if reducing output size is less important to you than the possibility of increasing quality then you can simply raise the default bitrate limits for both video and dolby digital ac  audio for p or blu ray disc input you could do this transcode video sh max  ac  and path and to and movie mkv which sets the target video bitrate to  kbps or  mbps  and the ac  audio bitrate including the pass through bitrate to  kbps but you would likely need to adjust that video bitrate a bit for dvd or other input instead use the big option transcode video sh big and path and to and movie mkv with big  the transcode video sh script does all the work for you based on the video resolution of your input input resolution and target video bitrate with big and p or blu ray video and  mbps p and  mbps i p or dvd video and  mbps for audio input the change via big is the same as using ac  obviously this means there s no impact on the output bitrate of mono and stereo aac audio tracks and and and mono and aac only and  kbps and none stereo and aac only and  kbps and none surround and ac  only up to  kbps and  kbps and  kbps with   channels keep in mind there s no guarantee that using big will make perceptible quality improvements for every video but it will improve some of them your mileage may vary also using big will reduce performance why you re doing more calculations and writing more bits out to disk and that takes more time the preset option in transcode video sh controls the x video encoder not the other preset system built into handbrake it takes a preset name as its single argument transcode video sh preset veryfast and path and to and movie mkv some x presets are also available as shortcut options i e you can use just veryfast instead of having to type preset veryfast transcode video sh veryfast and path and to and movie mkv the x presets are supposed to trade encoding speed for compression efficiency and their names attempt to reflect this however that s not quite how they always work preset name and shortcut option and note and and ultrafast and none and not recommended superfast and none and not recommended veryfast and veryfast and trades precision for speed faster and faster and trades precision for speed fast and fast and trades precision for speed medium and none and default slow and slow and trades speed for compression slower and slower and trades speed for compression veryslow and veryslow and trades speed for compression placebo and none and not recommended prior to version   of transcode video sh  fast was the default preset now medium is the default just like x and handbrake presets faster than medium trade precision for more speed this can mean a loss of fidelity as preset speed increases previous versions of this document used the term quality instead of precision the rate control system implemented in transcode video sh reduces the risk of blockiness or loss of detail when applying faster presets and less precision or fidelity is not always a bad thing with noisy source material due to coarse film grain or sloppy mastering however avoid using superfast and ultrafast because they do lower quality as well as compression efficiency presets slower than medium trade encoding speed for more compression efficiency usually this means more compression as preset speed decreases your mileage may vary when the output video bitrate is not below or near the target using medium  applying a slower preset can significantly reduce that bitrate any quality improvement from using the slow preset may not be perceptible for most input presets slower than slow may actually cause small artifacts for some input due to higher compression avoid using placebo because it s simply not worth the time and may not even produce smaller output than veryslow there s a reason this particular preset doesn t follow the nomenclature most people watch television anywhere from a distance between   to   times the diagonal of their screen with big screen desktop computers and mobile devices that viewing distance has shrunk to where it s essentially the same distance as the screen diagonal the goal of a smaller more portable format means that a video transcoding will be by necessity a lower bitrate copy which also means quality will be lost during the process of compression the trick is to make that quality loss invisible so that the transcoded copy remains good enough to be mistaken for the original here are some guidelines to consider when making that evaluation view the transcoding at the same size and from the same distance as you would the original otherwise you re not making a fair comparison don t pause playback to compare the transcoding with the original on the same frame the transcoding usually won t look as good because video is designed to be in motion and compression takes advantage of this to fool you view with audio on not only do you need to evaluate audio quality but without audio you re missing the immersive experience designed once again to fool you when you do see or hear something that looks or sounds wrong compare your observation against the original even blu ray discs have flaws these can be caused by bad encoding bad mastering or just plain bad source material about half of all high definition video on broadcast television is in p format most people who watch television don t have a surround sound system with which to listen to it if p video and stereo audio look and sound acceptable you might want to consider these formats to save transcoding time and storage space this is especially appropriate for mobile devices such as phones with their smaller screens and limited audio output use the p option to constrain p or blu ray disc input within a x pixel boundary transcode video sh p and path and to and movie mkv this doesn t affect video input that is already that size or smaller such as dvds add the no surround option to disable multi channel surround sound and limit output to at most two channel stereo transcode video sh p no surround and path and to and movie mkv many blu ray discs and dvds have additional audio tracks some of these tracks might be for other languages and some for commentaries to include audio track  when transcoding use the add audio option transcode video sh add audio  and path and to and movie mkv to also include audio track  and name it director commentary transcode video sh add audio  add audio  director commentary and path and to and movie mkv starting with version   of transcode video sh  track names can include a comma  by default all added audio tracks are transcoded in aac format if the original audio track is multi channel surround sound use the allow ac option to transcode in dolby digital ac  format transcode video sh allow ac add audio  add audio  director commentary and path and to and movie mkv the allow ac option applies to all added audio tracks the dts audio format has both lossless and lossy variants and is usually available on blu ray discs use the allow dts option to include these tracks in their original format without transcoding transcode video sh allow dts and path and to and movie mkv the allow dts option applies to both the main audio track and all added audio tracks keep in mind that lossless dts hd master audio tracks are encoded at bitrates often larger than the default target video bitrate so including them is of dubious value if your goal with transcoding is compression also while handbrakecli can include dts audio tracks within the mp format the output is not compatible with itunes apple tv or many other devices although transcode video sh doesn t handle multiple inputs it s easy to add this capability by creating a batch sh script such a script can simply be a list of commands and bin and bash transcode video sh crop     and path and to and movie mkv transcode video sh crop and path and to and another movie mkv transcode video sh crop     and path and to and yet another movie mkv but a better solution is to write the script once and supply the list of movies and their crop values separately and bin and bash readonly work cd dirname  pwd readonly queue work and queue txt readonly crops work and crops input sed n p queue while input do titlename basename input and sed s and and and cropfile crops and titlename txt if f cropfile then cropoption crop cat cropfile else cropoption fi sed i d queue and and exit  transcode video sh cropoption input input sed n p queue this requires a work directory on disk with three items one of which is a directory itself batch sh crops and movie txt yet another movie txt queue txt the contents of crops and movie txt is simply the crop value for and path and to and movie mkv     and the contents of queue txt is just the list of movies full paths without quotes delimited by carriage returns and path and to and movie mkv and path and to and another movie mkv and path and to and yet another movie mkv notice that there s no crop file for and path and to and another movie mkv this is because it doesn t require cropping for other options that won t change from input to input e g mkv  simply augment the line in the script calling transcode video sh transcode video sh mkv cropoption input the transcoding process is started by executing the script and batch sh the path is first deleted from the queue txt file and then passed as an argument to the transcode video sh script to pause after transcode video sh returns simply insert a blank line at the top of the queue txt file a big thank you to the developers of handbrake and the other tools used by these scripts so much wow
41119267, so what is this library useful for good question let s answer by asking an other question have you been struggled at some point with the following issues well i need to add some shortcuts to some parts of my apps and it seems crappy to manually allocate the path and select the controllers i need i m tired of using the push view controller method i wish i had some kind of url handling to get to specific parts of my app just as easily as snapping a finger if it could even handle a controller stack this would just be awesome i found a library but it s not working with my custom container i found a great library but the route matching is not working with my requirements all this points are answered by waapprouting and more for all ios enable linking in your app it is always useful to tell your app to go to home and events and  and register with some magic involved for ios  and more specifically new iphones s and  and s respond to d touch d touch  the story the story  install and use install and use  go deeper go deeper let s be honest there are several routing libraries on github to handle some of the behaviors described but none of them fit all my requirements so i wrote this library with some things in mind handle a stack of controllers this is not ok to open the app on a hotel detail if there is not even a back button or if the back button sends me back to where i was before opening the app i just want the app to be opened so that when i hit back i m on the hotels list for the hotel city do not force you to get this working with my route matcher or my route handler if you want to provide your own you should be able to do it this last point is very important to me i used and use too many libraries which are tightly tied to their technologies plus the more they are dependant on their implementation the less it is testable this is why you ll see many protocols with a default implementation provided so i rewrote a custom route handler to deal with it and finally arrived to the conclusion that  of deeplinkkit was not used anymore this is when i decided to drop it and write my own so you might recognize some concepts of the two libraries especially in the router handler even if the implementation has nothing to do with deeplinkkit the implementation i provide uses uinavigationcontroller to handle the stack and can be used on uitabbarcontroller as well the route matching works on itemid and uses as the wildcard character use cocoapods this is the easiest way to install the router pod waapprouting if you want to link waapprouting into an ios app extension or a shared framework that is linked to an app extension  you ll need to ensure that the waappextension flag is set when you compile the framework to do so using cocoapods add this to your podfile postinstall do and installer and installer podsproject targets each do and target and if target name and waapprouting and target buildconfigurations each do and config and config buildsettings gccpreprocessordefinitions and and config buildsettings gccpreprocessordefinitions waappextension  end older versions of cocoapods may require you to use installer project instead of installer podsproject  so if you get an error complaining that podsproject does not exist update your cocoapods gem import import waapprouting and waapprouting h and you are good to start you also need to configure a url scheme i won t go into detail about this there is plenty of documentation out there a navigation controller is a good start uinavigationcontroller navigationcontroller uinavigationcontroller alloc init you ll need first to allocate a route matcher you can use the default i wrote or create your own and and create the default router self router waapprouter defaultrouter register you path using the syntax urlpathcomponent classname urlpathcomponent classname and urlpathcomponent classname optionaly you can trigger the modal presentation using character for example urlpathcomponent classname and modal modalclass would result when calling appscheme and and urlpathcomponent and modal to modalclass instance presented modally after placing classname in the navigation controller stack and and register the path self router registrar registerapproutepath list walistviewcontroller and itemid walistdetailviewcontroller and extra walistdetailextraviewcontroller presentingcontroller navigationcontroller add a block handler if needed and and register some blocks self router registrar registerblockroutehandler waapplink applink and and do something every time we are in list and something forroute list and finally set the navigation controller as the root controller self window rootviewcontroller navigationcontroller you can now use it and open the app with self application uiapplication self openurl nsurl urlwithstring appscheme and and list sourceapplication nil annotation nil don t forget to use the router bool application uiapplication application openurl nsurl url sourceapplication nsstring sourceapplication annotation id annotation return self router handleurl url each controller you use should implement waapproutertargetcontrollerprotocol it is a good idea to have a base view controller so implement this method and voil void reloadfromapplinkrefresh and and you can do something with self applink and

detail and an extra this could be seen as an article lists its detail and comments simpleexampleparameters this sample is the same as simpleexample but is using the waapplinkparameters the one more thing of this library morecomplexexample this sample demonstrates how to deal with a tab bar controller and how to handle modals pprevealsample this sample acts as a demonstration that with a little bit of effort custom container can fit into the routing library the code is heavily documented you should find all your answers otherwise open an issue and i ll respond as quickly as possible you might want to pass values to the controllers when they are allocated for example in a project i m involved in we have an image cache that the controllers needs to display images this image cache is allocated by the app delegate to avoid singletons and get more testable code for doing this you need to add a block implementation to the route handler routehandler setcontrollerpreconfigurationblock uiviewcontroller controller waapprouteentity routeentity waapplink applink if controller iskindofclass wabaseviewcontroller class wabaseviewcontroller controller imagecache imagecache  you can ask not to handle some routes at runtime by setting this block for example you might not want to display some controllers if not logged in routehandler setshouldhandleapplinkblock bool waapprouteentity entity and and could return no if not logged in for example return yes you can have wildcard urls like list and and extra meaning that for any value instead of the  the entity or the block would be executed avoid using it with entities but rather with block an url in form of list and will match both list and path and list and path and extra here is an example of an alert triggered each time we are after list and registrar registerblockroutehandler waapplink applink rznotificationview shownotificationon rznotificationcontextabovestatusbar message nsstring stringwithformat you are dealing with item id

rznotificationcontentcolordark withcompletion bool touched   forroute list and as said i hate libraries you cannot customize without forking and diverging from the original source that said you can customize the router in two ways custom route matcher and custom route handler my implementation deals with basics meaning that it won t support key value value for the query for example it is also case sentitive if you have your own url configuration like list and itemid implementing a new route matcher is a good idea to start read the waapproutematcherprotocol class you have two methods you need to implement matchesurl frompathpattern and parametersfromurl withpathpattern as you can see in my implementation i m using waroutepattern to match the url it s kind of inspired by sockit for the naming convention then you can easily create the router with and and allocate your route matcher myroutematcher routematcher myroutematcher new and and create the registrar waapprouteregistrar registrar waapprouteregistrar registrarwithroutematcher routematcher and and create the route handler waapproutehandler routehandler waapproutehandler routehandlerwithrouteregistrar registrar and and create the router waapprouter router waapprouter routerwithregistrar registrar routehandler routehandler if for example you don t want to handle a stack or use something else than a uinavigationcontroller  then consider creating your own route handler start by adopting waapproutehandlerprotocol protocol and then read waapproutehandler to get inspiration i still need to run some tests but the idea is to have a router for the classic url scheme and another one for universal links void application uiapplication nonnull application performactionforshortcutitem

objectfromuseractivity useractivity if object iskindofclass company class applink goto companies and  company object name return yes you should definitively take a look at the pprevealsample project to get an idea of how to get this working i m also here to help if needed basic idea is try to allocate all the navigation controllers you need and pass them as the presenting controller then this would behave like a tab bar see it s category if not then you are in the pprevealsideviewcontroller context where the navigation controller gets allocated on the fly the idea is to pass the container as the presentingcontroller property and implement the waapproutingcontainerpresentationprotocol protocol you need the optional method as well you cannot yet present a modal controller and then push a detail one like presenting a login view but pushed onto the signup controller because the stack retrieval is implemented as dealing with controller class unicity you cannot have two or more waapprouteentity with the same target class when the source controller class is not nil if you need to reuse the controller at differents places consider creating simple subclasses of a main controller which handles all the behavior there is a one more thing to this library which is waapplinkparameters class the idea behind is to avoid hardcoding the values the behavior is based on an implementation of waapprouterparametersprotocol protocol which means that you can provide your own or subclass waapplinkparameters which provides default behavior and all protocol methods implementation let s have a look to an example you can find on simpleexampleparameters sample project first create a subclass interface articleapplinkparameters waapplinkparameters property nonatomic

controller to another provide default values to a controller initialization all your configuration is done in one place only nsstring and nsnumber parameters are supported at this time no nsdate for example this could seems to be a pain in the ass to implement rather than using the parameters directly true but keep in mind i thought about this one in a large project with big maintenance and evolutions plan involved for new features pull requests are encouraged and greatly appreciated please try to maintain consistency with the existing code style if you re considering taking on

in the next release the installer and ui should be signed perhaps not the drivers see below  i understand bugs have not been fixed and not much progress made recently and the many users deserve an explanation fixing these issues would involve re architecturing the drivers basically rewriting the main dlls from scratch this is compounded by the fact that there is no driver signing certificate ev cert  ms wants to review the code to issue an ev cert and the drivers would not pass with the current vulnerabilites you would hope in addition the encryption code in the drivers is old and is slow compared to modern implementations otoh librecrypt is the only way to read luks volumes on windows that i know of and the user interface is the most friendly of the open source otfe applications imho  so it would be a shame if it became obsolete i believe the best way forward is to adopt the drivers from another open source project with signed drivers like veracrypt or diskcryptor and modify them to support luks as well this would mean two executables one that would work with luks volumes but would need a hack to run as the current librecrypt  and another that would run out of the box but would not open luks volumes i would of course review the new drivers for any obvious security issues meanwhile i ll fix the bugs relating to the ui documentation etc and mark the driver bugs as pending regards tdk tom kelsey full transparent encryption containers appear as removable disks in windows explorer compatible with linux encryption dm crypt and luks linux shell scripts support deniable encryption on linux explorer program lets you browse containers when you don t have administrator permissions supports smartcards and security tokens encrypted containers can be a file a partition or a whole disk opens legacy volumes created with freeotfe runs on windows vista onwards see note below for  bit versions supports many hash including sha  ripemd  tiger and encryption algorithms including aes twofish and serpent in several modes cbc lrw and xts optional key files let you use a thumb drive as a key portable mode doesn t need to be installed and leaves little trace on rd party pcs administrator rights needed deniable encryption in case of rubber hose cryptanalysis considered the most easy to use encryption program for windows please note this is a beta version with some known limitations particularly on  bit windows the text test mode is shown on the desktop simplified open and create container dialogs by removing hidden containers options creating hidden containers is now through separate dialogs which is easier and less error prone added experimental feature to create luks containers minor ui improvements including the option to remember the window position reviewed and simplified all the text used in the application to use less technical language a new menu time shows the recommended hidden offset so hidden containers can be used without memorizing a number more clearly separated luks and dm crypt options in the ui to prevent luks containers being accidentally opened as dm crypt change of name to librecrypt improved support for gpt partitioned discs improved new password dialog improved partition information when running as non admin important librecrypt in portable mode will not work on windows vista and later  bit versions without a extra step before use luks partitions on lvm volumes or lvm volumes in luks partitions cannot be accessed due to windows limitations to run in portable mode you need to have admin rights librecrypt does not support encryption of the operating system partition for this we recommend ubuntu linux or diskcryptor librecrypt installed on windows vista and later  bit versions adds the text test mode to the windows desktop please see the documentation for details on removing this librecrypt cannot access lvm containers without an additional filesystem driver that understands lvm no such filesystem driver exists for windows versions later than xp librecrypt cannot access ext volumes without an additional filesystem driver that can read ext on windows  please turn off safe boot and disklocker before installing there has been a report that kaspersky anti virus falsely reports librecrypt as having the generic trojan virus please disable or replace this before installing please follow these instructions to run librecrypt in portable mode on  bit windows if you do not do this you will get the error windows requires a digitally signed driver when starting the drivers there is no need to do this if librecrypt is installed and start librecrypt click no on the prompt to start the portable drivers and ok on the warning dialog about not having any loaded drivers and click the tools allow test signed drivers menu item and reboot and after rebooting the words test mode appear in the four corners of the desktop please see the documentation for details on removing this librecrypt needs to be run as administrator the first time it is run after that it can be run as an ordinary user this release has changes to the drivers if upgrading from previous versions of librecryptdoxbox or freeotfe please completely uninstall the old version first support for the following cyphers will be removed in a future version please convert to another xor plain single des ditto for the plain hash backwards compatibility with older versions of freeotfe before   will be removed in version   please convert any freeotfe volumes this can be done by creating a new container and copying the files across these issues relate to passwords keyphrases containing non ascii characters e g accented letters and non latin scripts not to ascii special characters like the handling of keyphrases containing non ascii characters will change in a future version this change will not be backwards compatible so in this version it is recommended to use only ascii characters in keyphrases there are possible bugs in opening volumes created with freeotfe with non ascii characters if you experience problems please use the legacy app to change the password to an ascii one and retry

9674057, lazybones project creation tool  does not and will not have a command line tool that will bootstrap a project it s a good decision for ratpack but i m lazy and want tools to do the boring stuff for me the tool is very simple it allows you to create a new project structure for any framework or library for which the tool has a template you can even contribute templates by sending pull requests to this github project or publishing more info available below does for web applications lazybones also includes a subtemplates feature that resembles the behaviour of yeoman s sub generators allowing you to generate optional extras controllers scaffolding etc inside a project sdk install lazybones unpack it to a local directory and then add its bin directory to your path environment variable to create a new project run lazybones create template name template version target directory so if you wanted to create a skeleton ratpack project in a new my rat app directory you would run lazybones create ratpack    my rat app the version is optional and if you leave it out lazybones will install the latest version of the template it can find named templates are all stored on bintray by default lazybones searches for templates in the pledbrook and lazybones templates repository but you can use other bintray repositories by adding some configuration set the custom repositories section under configuration later in this document you re not limited to only bintray as you can install templates directly from a url too of course it can be pretty laborious copying and pasting urls around so lazybones allows you to configure aliases for urls that you use frequently by adding the following configuration to your lazybones settings file and lazybones and config groovy see below for more details on this  you can install the template by name templates mappings  in other words you could now run lazybones create mytmpl my app note that when using the url option there is no need to specify a version you should also be aware that mappings take precedence i e if a mapping has the same name as an existing template the mapping is used this essentially creates a simple override mechanism there is just one more thing to say about the create command by default it creates the specified directory and puts the initial project in there if you want to unpack a template in the current directory instead for example if you have already created the project directory then just pass as the directory lazybones create ratpack once you have created a new project from a template you may notice that the project directory contains a lazybones sub directory you may delete this but then you won t be able to use the generate command see next section if the project template has support for it many project templates request information from you such as a project name a group id a default package etc if this is the umpteenth time you have created a project from a given template then answering the questions can become tedious there is also the problem of scripting and automation when you want to create a project without user intervention the solution to both these issues is to pass the values on the command line lazybones create ratpack    ratapp pgroup org example ppackage org example myapp the p option allows you to pass property values into the project templates without user intervention the key is to know what the property names are and that comes down to the project template at the moment the best way to find out what those properties are is to look at the post install script itself the last option to mention is with git which will automatically create a new git repository in the project directory the only requirement is that you have the git command on your path as of lazybones version   project templates can incorporate subtemplates imagine that you have just created a new web application project from a template and that template documents that you can create new controllers using a sub template named controller to use it just cd into the project directory lazybones generate controller this will probably ask you for the name of the controller and its package before generating the corresponding controller file in your project you can reuse the command to create as many controllers as you need as with the create command you can also pass in property values on the command line if the subtemplate is parameterised lazybones generate controller ppackage org example myapp pclass book the last option available to you as a user is template qualifiers these only work if the subtemplate supports them but they allow you to pass additional information in a concise way lazybones generate artifact controller in this case the template name is artifact  but we have qualified it with an extra controller you can pass in as many qualifiers as you want you just separate them with note that you do not specify a version with the generate command this is because the subtemplates are embedded directly in the project template and so there can only be one version available to you to see what templates you can install run lazybones list this will list all aliases and remote templates if you want to see what templates you have cached locally run lazybones list cached in fact cached is implied if lazybones can t connect to the internet you can also find out more about a template through the info command lazybones info template name this will print a description of the template and what versions are available for it if you re offline this will simply display an error message lazybones will run out of the box without any extra configuration but the tool does allow you to override the default behaviour via a fixed set of configuration options these options can be provided in a number of ways following a set order of precedence  system properties of the form lazybones  which can be passed into the app via either javaopts or lazybonesopts environment variables for example env javaopts dlazybones config file and path and to and my custom default config groovy lazybones highest precedence i e it overrides all other sources of setting data  user configuration file in userhome and lazybones and config groovy this is parsed using groovy s configslurper  so if you re familiar with that syntax you ll be right at home otherwise just see the examples below  since   a json configuration file in userhome and lazybones and managed config groovy that is used by the config commands you can edit it this as well  a groovy based default configuration file that is provided by the application itself but you can specify an alternative file via the lazybones config file system property lazybones also provides a convenient mechanism for setting and removing options via the command line the config command the config command provides several sub commands that allow you to interact with the persisted lazybones configuration specifically the json config file you run a sub command via where sub cmd is one of set option value value allows you to change the value of a configuration setting multiple values are treated as a single array and list value the new value replaces any existing one add option value appends an extra value to an existing array and list setting reports an error if the setting doesn t accept multiple values if the setting doesn t already have a value this command will initialise it with an array containing the given value clear option removes a setting from the configuration effectively reverting it to whatever the internal default is show all option shows the current value of a setting you can use the all argument without a setting name to display all the current settings and their values list displays all the configuration settings supported by lazybones so what configuration settings are you likely to customise lazybones will by default download the templates from a specific bintray repository if you want to host template packages in a different repository you can add it to lazybone s search path via the bintrayrepositories bintrayrepositories kyleboon and lazybones  pledbrook and lazybones templates if a template exists in more than one repository it will be downloaded from the first repository in the list that it appears in if you regularly use a template at a specific url rather than from bintray then you will want to alias that url to a name that s where template mappings or aliases come in the aliases are defined as normal settings of the form in a groovy configuration file you can define multiple aliases in a block templates mappings after file and and and var and tmp and afterburnerfx    zip  alternatively add them from the command line like this lazybones config set templates mappings after file and and and var and tmp and afterburnerfx    zip the aliases will always be available to you until you remove them from the persisted configuration many people have to work behind a proxy but lazybones didn t make it easy to configure one in fact the only way to do it was to add the relevant system properties to a javaopts environment variable from    you now have another lazybones has stolen the idea of having a special form of configuration option for system properties from gradle so if you define a property with a systemprop prefix it will be added as a system property internally so to configure an http proxy you only need to add the following to your lazybones configuration systemprop http proxyhost localhost proxyport   https proxyhost localhost proxyport   to avoid potential configuration issues use the same proxy settings for http and https if possible if your proxy requires authentication you will need to add a couple of extra properties systemprop http proxyuser johndoe proxypassword mypassword  as with the host and port there are https variants of the username and passwordi these are miscellaneous options that can be overridden on the command line and and this starts a line comment and and set logging level overridden by command line args options loglevel severe the logging level can either be overridden using the same loglevel setting lazybones loglevel severe info ratpack or via verbose  quiet  and info options lazybones verbose info ratpack the logging level can be one of warning this project is split into two parts  the lazybones command line tool and  the project templates the command line tool is created via gradle s application plugin the main class is uk co cacoethes lazybones lazybonesmain  which currently implements all the sub commands create list etc as concrete methods the main class plus everything else under src and main is packaged into a lazybones jar that is included in the distribution zip the application gradle plugin generates a lazybones script that then runs the main class with all required dependencies on the classpath to build the distribution simply run and gradlew distzip the project templates are simply directory structures with whatever files in them that you want ultimately the template project directories will be zipped from there lazybones downloads the zips on demand and caches them in a local user directory currently and lazybones and templates if you want empty directories to form part of the project template then simply add an empty retain file to each one when the template archive is created any retain files are filtered out but the containing directories are included to package up a template simply run and gradlew packagetemplate templatename the name of the project template comes from the containing directory which is assumed to be lowercase hyphenated the template name is the equivalent camel case form so the template directory structure in src and templates and my template results in a template called mytemplate  which can be packaged with and gradlew packagetemplatemytemplate the project template archive will be created in the build directory with the name template name template version zip see the small section below on how the template version is derived you can also package all the templates in one fell swoop and gradlew packagealltemplates once a template is packaged up you can publish it to a generic non maven bintray repository by running and gradlew publishtemplate templatename this will initially fail because the build does not know where to publish to that s quickly fixed by adding a gradle properties file in the root of this project that contains at least these properties repo username yourbintrayusername repo apikey yourbintrayapikey you can then publish new versions of templates whenever you want note that you cannot republish with this mechanism so remember to increment the version if you need to finally you can publish the whole shebang unusual with and gradlew publishalltemplates if you don t want to publish your template you can install it locally using the installtemplate rule and gradlew installtemplate templatename this will install the template to and lazybones and templates so that you can use it without moving it to bintray first and that s it for the project templates you define the version of a template by putting a version file in the root directory of the template that contains just the version number for example you specify a version of    for the my template template by adding the file src and templates and my template and version with the contents    that s it the version file will automatically be excluded from the project template archive contributing templates  for information on how to create and publish lazybones templates

38899744, you don t like having to have to decide what port to use for a service maybe you re annoyed by a firewall that only allows traffic to port  or even a packet inspecting one that only allows real tls traffic on port  but you want to ssh through none the less welcome to serve a protocol recognizing and stacking server and dispatcher serve allows you to serve multiple protocols on a single socket example handlers include proxy http tls through which https is handled  echo and discard more can easily be added as long as the protocol sends some data that can be recognized the proxy handler allows you to redirect the connection to external services such as openssh or nginx in case you don t want or can t use a go implementation in most cases proxy will be sufficient so what does this mean well it means that if you run serve for port   and  or all the ports although i would suggest just having your firewall redirect things in that case rather than having  listening sockets  you could ask for http s on port  ssh on port  and ssh over tls meaning undetectable without a mitm attack on port  you have to admit that it s kind of neat all bytes read by serve are of course fed into whatever ends up having to handle the protocol for more details on the protocol matching look at the serve library directly served can either be installed from source super simple with go  or by downloading a prepackaged binary release to download source requires go    or above go get github com and kennylevinsen and served it can be run with cd gopath and src and github com and kennylevinsen and served go build and served exampleconf json serve and by extension served can only detect protocols initiated by the client that is protocols where the client starts out by blindly sending a unique blob that can be used to identify the protocol i called the first toy version serve  and needed to call the new directory in my development folder something else so it became serve d was added to this configurable front end daemon  to distinguish it from the library due to potentially large amounts of parameters served consumes a json configuration file the only parameter taken by served is the name of this file the format is as follows and and listening address as given directly to net listen address   and and maximum read size for protocol detection before fallback or failure and and defaults to  maxread  and and logging to stdout and and defaults to false logstdout true and and logging to file note that only one logging destination can be and and enabled at a given time and and defaults to empty string meaning disabled logfile served log  and and the enabled protocolhandlers protocols and and name of the protocolhandler kind proxy  and and setting this flag to true means that this protocolhandler and and will not be used in protocol detection but instead be used and and as a fallback in case of failed detection and and defaults to false default false and and protocol specific configuration and and defaults to empty conf magic ssh  target localhost  simply dials another service to handle the protocol matches protocol using the user defined string if an array of strings is provided then multiproxy will be used instead of proxy internally which will try to match any of the provided strings from shortest to longest progressively requesting more data as necessary magic string or string the bytes to look for in order to identify the protocol example ssh or get  post  head target string the address as given directly to net dial to call the real service example localhost  looks for a tls    clienthello handshake and feeds it into go s tls handling the resulting net conn is fed back through the protocol detection allowing for any other supported protocol to go over tls cert string the certificate pem file path to use for the server example cert pem key string the key pem file path to use for the server example key pem protos string the protocols the tls server will advertise support for in the handshake example http and    ssh as tls works as a transport it can be used for anything not just http tls and proxy handler for ssh would make it possible to do the following to grant you stealthy ssh over tls which would be indistinguishable from https traffic ssh oproxycommand openssl sclient connect h p tls quiet p servedhost ssh oproxycommand tunnel tls h p p servedhost looks for already established tls transports allowing for checks against some of the connection properties such as sni negotiatedprotocols string the protocol to look for defaults to no check example h  h  negotiatedprotocolismutual bool check if the protocol was one that was advertised or not defaults to no check example true servernames string the sni server name to look for defaults to no check example http golang org target string the target to dial upon a match example http golang org  dialtls bool whether or not to use tls when dialing this also copies servername and protocol example true simple file server without directory listing might change in the future it guards against navigating out of the directory with some simple path magic it identifies http traffic by checking for possible methods get  put  head  post  trace  patch  delete  options  connect forwarding to another http server can be done by just putting this list of methods in as magics for a proxy handler path string path to serve from example and srv and http and defaultfile string optional file to serve for and example index html notfoundmsg string optional  body example doctype html html body not found and body and html notfoundfile string optional  file example  html a test protocol requires that the client starts out by sending echo which will by echoed by itself of course no configuration same as discard start by sending discard no configuration if you feel silly try discard over tls

50303427, h align center struct based argument parsing for go and h go get github com and alexflint and go restructure this package allows you to express regular expressions by defining a struct and then capture matched sub expressions into struct fields here is a very simple email address parser import github com and alexflint and go restructure type emailaddress struct  struct user string w and  struct host string and  struct func main var addr emailaddress restructure find addr joe example com fmt println addr user and and prints joe fmt println addr host and and prints example com note that the above is far too simplistic to be used as a serious email address validator the regular expression that was executed was the concatenation of the struct tags w and and the first submatch was inserted into the user field and the second into the host field you may also use the regexp tag key but keep in mind that you must escape quotes and backslashes type emailaddress struct  string regexp user string regexp w and  string regexp host string regexp and  string regexp here is a slightly more sophisticated email address parser that uses nested structs type hostname struct domain string w and  struct tld string w and type emailaddress struct  struct user string a za z   and and  struct host hostname  struct func main var addr emailaddress success  restructure find addr joe example com if success fmt println addr user and and prints joe fmt println addr host domain and and prints example fmt println addr host tld and and prints com compare this to using the standard library regexp findstringsubmatchindex directly func main content joe example com expr regexp mustcompile a za z   and and w and w and indices expr findstringsubmatchindex content if len indices  userbegin userend

fmt println tld and and prints com when nesting one struct within another you can make the nested struct optional by marking it with the following example parses floating point numbers with optional sign and exponent and and matches       e    e and    type float struct sign sign and and sign is optional whole string   period struct frac string   and exponent exponent and and exponent is optional and and matches e and   e  e  type exponent struct  struct ee sign sign and and sign is optional num string   and and and matches and or type sign struct ch string and when an optional sub struct is not matched it will be set to nil javascript   sign nil whole   frac   exponent nil  e and  sign nil whole   frac   exponent sign ch and num  the following example uses regexp findall to extract all floating point numbers from a string using the same float struct as in the example above src there are   cats for every  dogs in the united states floatregexp restructure mustcompile float

39698188, pyparallel is an experimental proof of concept fork of python    designed to optimally exploit contemporary hardware multiple cpu cores fast ssds numa architectures and fast i and o channels gbe thunderbolt etc it presents a solution for removing the limitation of the python global interpreter lock gil without needing to actually remove it at all pyparallel is first and foremost an experiment it is not currently suitable for production it is a product of trial and error intended to shape the discussions surrounding the next generation of python we attempt to juggle the difficult task of setting the stage for python to flourish over the next  years without discarding all the progress we made in the last  pyparallel was created by an existing python committer with the intention of eventually merging it back into the mainline it is not a hostile fork there are many details that still need to be ironed out it will need to prove itself as an independent project first before it could be considered for inclusion back in the main source tree we anticipate this being at least  years out and think python  x would be a more realistic target than python  x  years sounds like a long time however it will come and go just like any other we may as well start the ball rolling now there s nothing wrong with slow and steady as long as you re heading in the right direction and it s not like we re getting any less cores per year expectations need to be set reasonably and we encourage the python community toward biasing yes versus biasing no with a view toward the long term benefits of such a project early adopters and technical evaluators will need to have thick skin a pioneering spirit and a hearty sense of adventure you will definitely hit a debugbreak or two if you re doing things right but hey you ll be able to melt all your cores during the process and that s kinda fun we encourage existing committers to play around and experiment to fork and to send pull requests one of the benefits of pyparallel at the moment is the freedom to experiment without the constraints that come with normal mainline development where much more discipline is required per commit it provides a nice change of pace and helps get the creative juices flowing there is also a lot of low hanging fruit ripe for picking by computer science and software engineering students that want to get their feet wet with open source note the parallel facilities provided by pyparallel are actually complementary to the single threaded event loop facilities provided by asyncio in fact we envision hybrid solutions emerging that use asyncio to drive the parallel facilities behind the scenes where the main thread dispatches requests to parallel servers behind the scenes acting as the coordinator for parallel computation we expose a new parallel module to python user code which must be used in order to leverage the new parallel execution facilities specifically users implement completion oriented protocol classes then register them with pyparallel tcp and ip client or server objects python import parallel class hello def connectionmade self transport data return b hello world r n def datareceived self transport data return b you said and data and r n server parallel server       parallel register transport server protocol hello parallel run the protocol callbacks are automatically executed in parallel this is achieved by creating parallel contexts for each client socket that connects to a server the parallel context owns the underlying socket object and all memory allocations required during callback execution are served from the context s heap which is a simple block allocator if callbacks need to send data back to the client they must return a sendable object bytes  bytearray or string that is they do not explicitly call read and write methods against the transport directly if the contents of a file needs to be returned transport sendfile can be used byte ranges can also be efficiently returned via transport rangedsendfile both of these methods serve file content directly from the kernel s cache via transmitfile the semantic behavior of the main thread the current thread holding the gil is unchanged instead we introduce the notion of a parallel thread or parallel context  and parallel objects which are pyobjects allocated from parallel contexts we provide an efficient way to detect if we re in a parallel thread via the pypxctx macro as well as a way to detect if a pyobject was allocated from a parallel thread via pyispx ob using only these two facilities we are able to intercept all thread sensitive parts of the interpreter and redirect to our new parallel alternative if necessary the gil entry and exit macros pybeginallowthreads and pyendallowthreads respectively also get ignored in parallel contexts we introduce one new restriction that will affect existing python code and c extensions don t persist parallel objects more explicitly don t cache objects that were created during parallel callback processing for the cpython interpreter internals in c  this means avoiding the following freelist manipulation first use static pyobject initialization and unicode interning on the python side this means avoiding mutation of global state or more specifically avoiding mutation of python objects that were allocated from the main thread don t append to a main thread list or assign to a main thread dict from a parallel thread we approached the problem of referencing counting and garbage collection within parallel contexts using a rigorous engineering methodology that can be summed up as follows let s not do it and see what happens nothing happened so we don t do it instead we manage object lifetime and memory allocation in parallel contexts by exploiting the temporal and predictable nature of the protocol callbacks which map closely to tcp and ip states connectionmade  datareceived  sendcomplete  etc a snapshot is taken prior to invoking the callback and then rolled back upon completion object lifetime is therefore governed by the duration of the callback all objects allocated during the processing of a http request for example including the final bytes object we send as a response will immediately cease to exist the moment our tcp and ip stack informs us the send completed specifically we perform the rollback activity upon receipt of the completion notification thus pyparallel requires no changes to existing reference counting and garbage collection semantics or apis pyincref op and pydecref op get ignored in parallel contexts and gc specific calls like pyobjectgcnew simply get re routed to our custom parallel object allocator in the same fashion as pyobjectnew this obviates the need for fine grain per object locking as well as the need for a thread safe concurrent garbage collector this is significant when you factor in how python s scoping works at a language level python code executing in a parallel thread can freely access any non local variables created by the main thread that is it has the exact same scoping and variable name resolution rules as any other python code this facilitates loading large data structures from the main thread and then freely accessing them from parallel callbacks the working set size of the python exe process is about gb when the trie and numpy array are loaded thus multiprocessing would not be feasible as you d have  separate processes of gb if you had  cores and started  workers requiring gb just for the processes the number of allocated objects is around   million the datrie library can efficiently store values if they re a  bit integer however our offsets are  bit so an  something byte pyobject needs to be allocated to represent each one this is significant because it demonstrates the competitive advantage pyparallel has against other languages when dealing with large heap sizes and object counts whilst simultaneously avoiding the need for continual gc motivated heap traversal a product of memory allocation pressure which is an inevitable side effect of high end network load where incoming links are saturated at line rate we ellaborate on this shortly for a more contained example we present the following we load an array with a billion elements consuming about gb of memory then expose a http server that services client requests in parallel randomly picking a slice of  elements within the array and summing it the principles are the same as the wikipedia instant search server random access to huge data structures in parallel where request latency and throughput scale linearly with cores and concurrency up to ncpu python import numpy as np import parallel onebillion  largearray np random randints low  high  size onebillion fmt the sum of the items in slice d d is d class random http true this class attribute tells pyparallel to use an sse accelerated http   parser for this protocol automatically translating a get request for the url and random to a direct call to random meaning we don t have to implement datareceived and do http parsing ourself http headers are accessible at this point via transport httpheaders  which is a dict def random self transport data this code executes within the new parallel execution environment we can access anything we d normally be able to access according to python s scope rules any new objects we create herein are parallel objects and will only exist for the duration of the callback although we could assign a scalar to self here provided we define it as a class variable above this would allow persistence of state between callbacks and could either be used to track a higher level protocol state like pop  or to track the results of intermediate computation keep in mind persisting to a scalar isn t so bad from an overhead perspective when you ve got other cores servicing other requests simultaneously pickling and unpickling a complex structure list dict to a string each request is fast and simple and allows us to avoid a whole host of memory and object and pointer ownership issues we d have to deal with if we were persisting container objects like lists and dicts start np random randint low  high onebillion  end start and  return fmt start end largearray start end sum server parallel server       parallel register transport server protocol random print press ctrl c to quit parallel run this split brain main thread versus parallel thread approach to object allocation and ownership is a unique breakthrough by separating the two concepts we get the best of both worlds reference counting and garbage collection at the global main thread level where object lifetime cannot be implicitly known any other way and very fast gc less allocation at the parallel level where we can rely on the temporal nature of our protocol semantics to manage object lifetime the incumbent main thread behavior doesn t need to know anything about the latter parallel behavior and the parallel environment knows how to avoid disturbing the former  furthermore our experimentation shows that the new solution plays nicely with tools such as cython provided the cython code uses normal python memory allocation facilities and doesn t try to persist objects generated from parallel contexts in fact our wikipedia instant search trie is powered by a cython project named datrie  which is a wrapper around the c library libdatrie this is significant as it allows us to continue to leverage the stellar work done by the python community for accelerating python or python esque code whilst simultaneously leveraging the benefits afforded by pyparallel entire request callbacks could be implemented in cython providing c like performance to those domains that rely upon it we anticipate similar compatibility with other optimizers like numba converting python code into performant potentially jit accelerated machine code will be a constantly evolving domain pyparallel is complimentary to these techniques providing the glue behind the scenes to minimize the latency between i and o and subsequent computation across multiple cores we defer to the other projects to provide means for accelerating the computation from within the callback it is a symbiotic relationship not a competitive one additionally because code executed within parallel contexts is normal python code we can run it in a single threaded fashion from the main thread during development which allows the normal debugging and unit testing facilities needed at such a stage we also implement experimental support for a parallel thread to acquire the gil and become the main thread in order to further assist debugging efforts we attribute the success of the pyparallel experiment to five key things being relatively unfamiliar with the intracacies of python s c implementation this was advantageous despite how counter intuitive it seems not knowing what you don t know is a great way to lower the cost of experimentation attacking parallelization and asynchronous i and o at the same time the two are intrinsically linked the single threaded non blocking event loop with a system multiplex call kqueue and epoll is simply not suitable for exploiting today s multicore gbe and environments if your i and o strategy isn t intrinsically linked to your parallel computation strategy you re not going to be able to optimally use your underlying hardware minimizing the latency between completion of i and o and subsequent scheduling of computation is critical the willingness of the cpython interpreter internals to be completely subverted by our parallel shenanigans without requiring any breaking api changes or complex locking semantics this was a delightful surprise and all credit goes to guido for developing the primitives the way he did  odd years ago the situational awareness provided by visual studio s debugger for facilitating such subversive changes on a code base we were ultimately unfamiliar with writing code was a miniscule portion of pyparallel s development time the vast majority of time was spent within the debugger stepping through unfamiliar code figuring out ways to subvert the interpreter or determing why our attempts at subversion weren t working all aha moments were had either in a the shower or b whilst visual studio was attached to pythond exe and we were staring at call stacks locals autos memory values and source code all within the same place stepping through individual instructions constantly building up our situational awareness designing around mechanical sympathy at the hardware kernel os userspace and protocol level the reason windows was used to develop pyparallel is because it simply has the best kernel and userspace primitives for not only solving the problem but solving it as optimally as the underlying hardware will allow windows itself exhibits excellent mechanical sympathy between all levels of the stack which we leverage extensively the reception of a tcp and ip packet off the wire to the i and o request completion by the nic s device driver to the threadpool i and o completion to the dispatching of the most optimal thread within our process to calling back into the c function we requested to us immediately invoking the relevant python object s datareceived call mechanical sympathy is maintained at every layer of the stack facilitating the lowest possible latency thread sensitive calls are ubiquitous within the python interpreter past experiments have shown that even minor changes to the overhead incurred by pyincref op and pydecref op impact the interpreter s performance in a non negligible way thus the first problem we had to solve was coming up with a quick way to detect whether or not we were in a parallel context the quicker it can be detected the lower the overhead the more viable the approach is likely to be the key to being fast is to do less so we wondered what do we reliably have access to at all times that we can use to distinguish our parallel threads from normal main threads the convergence was quick thread ids we add the following public members to pyparallel h pyapidata volatile long pymainthreadid pyapifunc void pyparalleljustacquiredgil and we alter takegil in cevalgil h to call into us as soon as a main thread has acquired the gil  and  static void takegil pythreadstate tstate mutexlock switchmutex and we now hold the gil and and ifdef withparallel and pyparalleljustacquiredgil pyatomicstorerelaxed gillocked  pyannotaterwlockacquired gillocked and iswrite and  the implementation of pyparalleljustacquiredgil in pyparallel c simply updates pymainthreadid pyparalleljustacquiredgil void pymainthreadid pygetcurrentthreadid we now have all we need to detect if we re in a parallel context by simply comparing the value of pymainthreadid to pygetcurrentthreadid  which becomes the basis for our pypxctx macro however we can improve things further pygetcurrentthreadid has a direct analogue on both windows and posix getcurrentthreadid and pthreadself  respectively but our pypxctx call will be ubiquitous is there any way we can avoid a function call on windows we can interrogate the thread environment block teb directly to derive the current thread id on posix and amd we d use read fg sbase instead this guarantees to return a unique address for a thread and we d simply use this for the identity test instead of the actual thread id assigned by the operating system thus the pypxctx macro essentially expands to a simple equality test between two  bit variables for example if pypxctx return expands to if pymainthreadid readgsdword x return this approach has remained unchanged since inception and has proven to be a reliable and optimal solution for parallel context detection it has one limitation though it can t be used in parts of the interpreter that operate without holding the gil luckily this is mostly limited to code that deals with gil acquisition which is not frequently executed relative to the rest of the code base in this situation code can use the more reliable but slightly slower alternative pyparallelgetactivecontext  which returns the tls ctx variable we set within pyparallel c as soon as we re invoked by the threadpool upon i and o completion this method doesn t suffer the false positive issue pypxctx is subject to when the gil isn t held the increased overhead comes from the two level lookup required to resolve the tls variable  if ctx b d ff c   mov ecxdword ptr tlsindex efdh ba     mov edxh        mov qword ptr rbx and h rax   b       mov raxqword ptr gs h  b  c mov raxqword ptr rax and rcx   b c  mov rcxqword ptr rdx and rax   c test rcxrcx   je newcontext and h eah this overhead is an acceptable trade off when we need to resolve our ctx variable once within a c function body but it makes sense to avoid it if we can for hot path code like reference counting interception when you don t know what you don t know play defense specifically code defensively we implement pyguard and pxguard macros and liberally sprinkle them over the code the former says crash if i hit this from a parallel thread  the latter says crash if i hit this from the main thread crash  in this context refers to raising a pyfatalerror with file and line information or if the environment variable pyparallelnominidump is set to  we debugbreak  allowing us to attach the visual studio debugger we add additional guards for protecting not only contexts but object and memory allocations as well it is valuable during development to be able to test and assert if necessary that a given pyobject op is a main thread object or a parallel thread object pyguardobj o if we re main thread and o is a parallel object crash pxguardobj o if we re a parallel thread and o is a main thread object crash pypxguardobj o context sensitive crash if we re a main thread and o is a parallel object crash if we re a parallel thread and o is a main thread object also crash likewise for a given void ptr memory allocation pyguardmem m if we re a main thread and m is memory allocated from a parallel context crash pxguardmem m if we re a parallel thread and m is memory allocated from a main thread crash pypxguardmem m context sensitive crash if we re a main thread and m is memory allocated from a parallel context crash if we re a parallel thread and m is memory is allocated from a main thread also crash in general our rule of thumb is the venerable crash early crash often

vendor and jquery js excludes any url paths that match the given spec these files will not show up in packages and they will not be accessible by default and  are ignored the former protects folders such as svn from being accessed and the latter protects sass partial files from being accessed directly note that this matches against url paths not local file paths this means something like scss will not work as all stylesheet files will be compiled to css ignore filespec here s an example class app sinatra base assets ignores all files matching private js in any folder ignore private js ignores all files in and app and js and foo and and ignore and js and foo by default and  are ignored to disable this behavior you can use clearignores before your ignore lines clearignores ignore private js to check if a certain file is ignored use assets ignore assets ignored and css and chrome css true caches the built packages on application startup if this is not used the packages will be

29041011, in the big data era data is not only becoming bigger and bigger it is also becoming more and more complex this translates into a spectacular increase of the dimensionality of the data for example the dimensionality of a set of images is the number of pixels in any image which ranges from thousands to millions computers have no problem processing that many dimensions however we humans are limited to three dimensions computers still need us thankfully  so we often need ways to effectively visualize high dimensional data before handing it over to the computer how can we possibly reduce the dimensionality of a dataset from an arbitrary number to two or three which is what we re doing when we visualize data on a screen the answer lies in the observation that many real world datasets have a low intrinsic dimensionality even though they re embedded in a high dimensional space imagine that you re shooting a panoramic landscape with your camera while rotating around yourself we can consider every picture as a point in a  dimensional space assuming a  megapixels camera yet the set of pictures approximately lie in a three dimensional space yaw pitch roll this low dimensional space is embedded within the high dimensional space in a complex nonlinear way hidden in the data this structure can only be recovered via specific mathematical methods let s first import

digits with t sne images and digitstsne png we observe that the images corresponding to the different digits are clearly separated into different clusters of points let s explain how the algorithm works first a few definitions a data point is a point span class math tex data type tex xi and span in the original data space span class math tex data type tex mathbf r d and span  where span class math tex data type tex d  and span is the dimensionality of the data space every point is an image of a handwritten digit here there are span class math tex data type tex n  and span points a map point is a point span class math tex data type tex yi and span in the map space span class math tex data type tex mathbf r  and span this space will contain our final representation of the dataset there is a bijection between the data points and the map points every map point represents one of the original images how do we choose the positions of the map points we want to conserve the structure of the data more specifically if two data points are close together we want the two corresponding map points to be close too let s span class math tex data type tex left and xi xj right and and span be the euclidean distance between two data points and span class math tex data type tex left and yi yj right and and span the distance between the map points we first define a conditional similarity between the two data points span class math tex data type tex p j and i frac exp left left and xi xj right and  big and  sigmai  right displaystyle sum k neq i exp left left and xi xk right and  big and  sigmai  right and span this measures how close span class math tex data type tex xj and span is from span class math tex data type tex xi and span  considering a gaussian distribution around span class math tex data type tex xi and span with a given variance span class math tex data type tex sigmai  and span this variance is different for every point it is chosen such that points in dense areas are given a smaller variance than points in sparse areas the original paper details how this variance is computed exactly now we define the similarity as a symmetrized version of the conditional similarity span class math tex data type tex p ij frac p j and i and p i and j n and span we obtain a similarity matrix for our original dataset what does this matrix look like the following function computes the similarity with a constant span class math tex data type tex sigma and span data executable true data type programlisting def jointprobabilitiesconstantsigma d sigma p np exp d  and  sigma  p and np sum p axis  return p we now compute the similarity with a span class math tex data type tex sigmai and span depending on the data point found via a binary search according to the

the map similarity matrix span class math tex data type tex big q ij big and span depends on the map points what we want is for these two matrices to be as close as possible this would mean that similar data points yield similar map points let s assume that our map points are all connected with springs the stiffness of a spring connecting points span class math tex data type tex i and span and span class math tex data type tex j and span depends on the mismatch between the similarity of the two data points and the similarity of the two map points that is span class math tex data type

gaussian distribution which compensates the original imbalance for a given similarity between two data points the two corresponding map points will need to be much further apart in order for their

dataset it successfully uncovers hidden structures in the data exposing natural clusters and smooth nonlinear variations along the dimensions it has been implemented in many languages including python and it can be easily used thanks to the scikit learn library the references below describe some optimizations and improvements that can be made to the algorithm and implementations in particular the

with role lt role n role role aws bugsnag com the nth instances tagged with role lt role instance id aws bugsnag com all your ec instances by instance id n instance id aws bugsnag com all your ec instances by instance id it uses cnames so that instances will resolve to internal ip addresses if you query from inside aws and external ip addresses if you query from the outside quick start  there s a long winded setup guide setup  but if you already know your way around ec you ll need to  open up port  udp and tcp on your security group  boot an instance with an iam role with ec describeinstances permission or use an iam user and configure aws name server manually  install aws name server  setup your ns records correctly parameters  this is the domain you wish to serve i e aws example com it is the only required parameter the publically resolvable hostname of the current machine this defaults sensibly so you only need to set this if you see a warning in the logs an amazon key pair with permission to run ec describeinstances this defaults to the iam role of the machine running aws name server or to the values of the environment variables awsaccesskeyid and awssecretaccesskey or awsaccesskey and awssecretkey this defaults to the region in which aws name server is running or us east  these instructions assume you re going to launch a new ec instance to run aws name server if you want to run it on an existing server adapt the instructions to suit let you give ec instances permission to access the aws api we will need our dns machine to run ec describeinstances  log into the aws web console and navigate to iam  create a new role called iam role aws name server  select the amazon ec role type  create a custom policy called describe instances only with the content version     statement action ec describeinstances  effect allow  resource describe what traffic is allowed to get to your instance dns servers use udp port  and tcp port   log into the aws web console and navigate to ec  create a new security group called aws name server  configure it to have type protocol port source ssh tcp  my ip x x x x and  dns udp  anywhere     and  custom tcp  anywhere     and  this will let you ssh in to the dns server and let anyone run dns queries i recommend running bit hvm based ebs backed ubuntu   on a t micro can use whatever distro you like the most  log into the aws web console and navigate to ec  click launch instance  select your favourite ami e g ami acffc  select your favourite cheap instance type e g t micro if you don t have vpcs yet choose t micro instead  set iam role to iam role aws name server  skip through disks the default is fine  skip through tags though if you set name dns and role dns you can test the server  select an existing security group sg aws name server  launch unzip aws name server zip  move the binary into and usr and bin sudo cp aws name server and usr and bin sudo chmod and x and usr and bin and aws name server  optional set the capabilities of aws name server so it doesn t need to run as root the capnetbindservice capability allows this program to bind to ports below  when it us run as a non root user sudo setcap capnetbindservice and ep and usr and bin and aws name server if you use upstart the default process manager under ubuntu you can use the provided upstart script you ll need to change the script to reflect your hostname  open upstart and aws name server conf and change domain internal to domain lt your domain  sudo cp upstart and aws name server conf and etc and init and  sudo initctl start aws name server to add your dns server into the global dns tree you need to add an ns record from the parent domain to your new server let s say you currently have dns for example com  and you re running aws name server on the machine ec     compute  amazonaws com in the admin page for example com s dns add a new record of the form aws example com  in ns ec     compute  amazonaws com the ttl can be whatever you want i like  minutes because it s not too long to wait if i make a mistake the value should be a hostname for your server that is directly resolvable i e not a cname the public hostnames that amazon gives instances are perfect for this troubleshooting  there s a lot that can go wrong so troubleshooting takes a while first try looking in the logs and var and log and upstart and aws name server log if you re using upstart if there s nothing there then try and var and log and syslog try running dig dns aws example com localhost while ssh d into the machine it should return a cname record if not look in the logs the chances are the dns server is not running this happens if your ec credentials are wrong assuming you can make dns lookups to localhost try running dig dns aws example com ec     compute  amazonaws com from your laptop if you don t get a reply double check the security group config assuming you can make dns lookups correctly when pointing dig at the dns server try running dig ns aws example com if this doesn t return anything you probably need to update your ns records if you ve already done this you might need to wait a few minutes for caches to clear this happens when the hostname parameter has been set or auto detected to something different from what you ve configured the ns records to be this may cause hard to debug issues so you should set hostname correctly

filename utf  suspend resume return json parse rawfile and and the resulting function behaves like any other async function in node readjsonfile package json  function err packagedata console log packagedata name and and suspend note that async lets you return your final result instead of having to explicitly accept a callback parameter and pass the result manually likewise any uncaught errors will be passed to the callback as the error argument see the section on error handling error handling for more information accepts a generator function fn  and returns a wrapper function that returns a promise if a value is returned or the generator function completes with no explicit return value  the promise is resolved if an error is thrown then the promise is rejected example javascript var getfavoritenumberbyusername suspend promise function username var user yield usermodel find username username return user favoritecolor and and the resulting function exposes a promise api var promise getfavoritenumberbyusername jmar note that the above example also demonstrates the ability to yield promises which is documented below promises accepts a generator function fn  and returns a wrapper function that unlike async  makes no assumptions regarding callback conventions this makes fn useful for event handlers settimeout functions and other use cases that don t expect node s typical asynchronous method signature note as a shorthand convenience suspend fn is an alias for suspend fn fn example javascript var listener suspend function req res and and wait  seconds yield settimeout suspend resume   res writehead  content type text and plain res end thanks for being patient http createserver listener listen      accepts a generator function fn and runs it immediately if an optional callback cb is provided any errors or return values will be passed to it example javascript suspend run function var data yield fs readfile file  suspend resume yield fs writefile file copy  data suspend resume  function err if err console error err an alias for suspend fn fn suspendfnfn the yield keyword is a new language feature associated with generators in es whenever a yield is encountered execution of the generator is suspended until something external tells it to resume in suspend as the name implies we use yield to suspend the generator while performing asynchronous operations and then resume it once the operation is complete if you re using promises promises or thunks thunks  suspend can resume for you automatically however given that the majority of the node ecosystem relies on callbacks suspend provides some simple mechanisms for interacting with callback based code resume suspendresume and resumeraw suspendresumeraw a simple callback factory for interacting with node style asynchronous functions example javascript suspend function var data yield fs readfile filename utf  suspend resume as can be seen resume creates node style callbacks that know how to handle the results from the asynchronous operation and automatically resume the generator if the first argument passed to the callback is an error or any other truthy value  it will be thrown back in the generator body otherwise the value of the second argument will be the result of the asynchronous operation while resume suspendresume knows how to intelligently handle node style callbacks sometimes we have to work with code that doesn t follow these conventions in these situations resumeraw can be used resumeraw makes no assumptions regarding what the arguments are and simply provides the results back as an array example javascript suspend function var data yield fs exists filename suspend resumeraw console log data and and true as was previously mentioned suspend is also designed to play nice with promises in fact promises and suspend make a particularly nice combination as it completely alleviates the need for callbacks or resume to use suspend with promises simply yield the promise itself example javascript suspend function var user yield usermodel find username jmar example javascript var readfile thunkify fs readfile suspend function var data yield readfile filename utf as can be seen one must simply yield the thunk itself and suspend will appropriately handle the eventual result or error just like with promises thunks and suspend make a particularly nice combination as once again there s no need to pass in resume or other callback mechanism into the async function itself while yielding is a convenient way to wait for an operation to complete it does force things to be executed in series sometimes however we wish to do things in parallel in suspend parallel operations are made easy with fork and join unlike resume  which requires you to yield first fork creates a callback that will temporarily store the completion values until you subsequently yield on join this allows any arbitrary number of parallel operations to be forked  without suspending execution until we are ready to use their results example javascript suspend function var filenames yield fs readdir test  suspend resume filenames foreach function filename fs readfile test and and filename utf  suspend fork var files yield suspend join var numtests files reduce function cur prev return cur and prev match and it and g length   console log there are s tests  numtests the order of the results array will be based on the order in which you called fork  so there s no need to worry about which operation completes first example suspend function var filenames yield fs readdir dirname suspend resume  stats yield async map filenames fs stat suspend resume console log stats suspend allows us to handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors the same whenever an error is passed to the resume callback or a promise or thunk resolves to an error that error is thrown at the site of the yield expression this allows us to use native try and catches to handle errors regardless of whether they occurred synchronously or asynchronously example javascript suspend run function try var rawfile yield fs readfile package json  utf  suspend resume  packagedata json parse rawfile console log packagedata license and and mit catch err console error there was an error reading or parsing the file while unifying the error handling model is convenient it can also be tedious to write lots of try and catches for this reason both run and async will automatically pass any unhandled errors to their callbacks this makes it trivial to write functions using suspend that safely handle errors in accordance with node s callback conventions example run javascript suspend run function var rawfile yield fs readfile package json  utf  suspend resume  packagedata json parse rawfile console log packagedata license and and mit  function err if err console error there was an error reading or parsing the file example async javascript var readjsonfile suspend async function filename var rawfile yield fs readfile filename utf  suspend resume return json parse rawfile readjsonfile package json  function err packagedata if err console error there was an error reading or parsing the file else console log packagedata license and and mit here s what s important to remember  if an error occurs you ll have a chance to capture it with a try and catch  if you don t catch an error and you re using suspend  async or run with a callback then the error will be passed to the callback  otherwise the unhandled error will be re thrown globally npm test npm run script test es the mit

3985554, redisfailover provides a full automatic master and slave failover solution for ruby redis does not currently provide an automatic failover capability when configured for master and slave replication when the master node dies a new master must be manually brought online and assigned as the slave s new master this manual switch over is not desirable in high traffic sites where redis is a critical part of the overall architecture the existing standard redis client for ruby also only supports configuration for a single redis server when using master and slave replication it is desirable to have all writes go to the master and all reads go to one of the n configured slaves this gem built using zk attempts to address these failover scenarios one or more node manager daemons run as background processes and monitor all of your configured master and slave nodes when the daemon starts up it automatically discovers the current master and slaves background watchers are setup for each of the redis nodes as soon as a node is detected as being offline it will be moved to an unavailable state if the node that went offline was the master then one of the slaves will be promoted as the new master all existing slaves will be automatically reconfigured to point to the new master for replication all nodes marked as unavailable will be periodically checked to see if they have been brought back online if so the newly available nodes will be configured as slaves and brought back into the list of available nodes note that detection of a node going down should be nearly instantaneous since the mechanism used to keep tabs on a node is via a blocking redis blpop call no polling this call fails nearly immediately when the node actually goes offline to avoid false positives i e  intermittent flaky network interruption  the node manager will only mark a node as unavailable if it fails to communicate with it  times this is configurable via max failures see configuration options below note that you can and should deploy multiple node manager daemons since they each report periodic health reports and snapshots of the redis servers a node strategy is used to determine if a node is actually unavailable by default a majority strategy is used but you can also configure consensus or single as well this gem provides a redisfailover client wrapper that is master and slave aware the client is configured with a list of zookeeper servers the client will automatically contact the zookeeper cluster to find out the current state of the world i e  who is the current master and who are the current slaves the client also sets up a zookeeper watcher for the set of redis nodes controlled by the node manager daemon when the daemon promotes a new master or detects a node as going down zookeeper will notify the client near instantaneously so that it can rebuild its set of redis connections the client also acts as a load balancer in that it will automatically dispatch redis read operations to one of n slaves and redis write operations to the master if it fails to communicate with any node it will go back and fetch the current list of available servers and then optionally retry the operation redisfailover has an external dependency on zookeeper you must have a running zookeeper cluster already available in order to use redisfailover zookeeper provides redisfailover with its high availability and data consistency between redis failover clients and the node manager daemon please see the requirements section below for more information on installing and setting up zookeeper if you don t have it running already add this line to your application s gemfile gem redisfailover and then execute bundle or install it yourself as gem install redisfailover the node manager is a simple process that should be run as a background daemon the daemon supports the following options usage redisnodemanager options specific options n nodes nodes comma separated redis host port pairs z zkservers servers comma separated zookeeper host port pairs p password password redis password znode path path znode path override for storing redis server list max failures count max failures before manager marks node unavailable c config path path to yaml config file with chroot root path to zookeepers chroot e environment env config environment to use node strategy strategy strategy used when determining availability of nodes default majority failover strategy strategy strategy used when failing over to a new node default latency required node managers count required node managers that must be reachable to determine node state default  h help display all options to start the daemon for a simple master and slave configuration use the following redisnodemanager n localhost localhost  z localhost localhost localhost  the configuration parameters can also be specified in a config yml file an example configuration would look like the following maxfailures  nodestrategy majority failoverstrategy latency requirednodemanagers  nodes localhost  localhost  localhost  localhost  zkservers localhost  localhost  localhost  password foobar you would then simpy start the node manager via the following redisnodemanager c config yml you can also scope the configuration to a particular environment e g  staging and development see the examples directory for configuration file samples the node manager will automatically discover the master and slaves upon startup note that it is a good idea to run more than one instance of the node manager daemon in your environment at any moment a single node manager process will be designated to manage the redis servers if this node manager process dies or becomes partitioned from the network another node manager will be promoted as the primary manager of redis servers you can run as many node manager processes as you d like every node manager periodically records health snapshots which the primary and master node manager consults when determining if it should officially mark a redis server as unavailable by default a majority strategy is used also when a failover happens the primary node manager will consult the node snapshots to determine the best node to use as the new master the redis failover client must be used in conjunction with a running node manager daemon the client supports various configuration options however the only mandatory option is the list of zookeeper servers or an existing zk client instance explicitly specify the zk servers client redisfailover client new zkservers localhost localhost localhost  explicitly specify an existing zk client instance useful if using a connection pool etc zk zk new localhost localhost localhost  client redisfailover client new zk zk the client actually employs the common redis and redis namespace gems underneath so this should be a drop in replacement for your existing pure redis client usage the full set of options that can be passed to redisfailover client are zk an existing zk client instance zkservers comma separated zookeeper host port pairs znodepath the znode path override for redis server list optional password password for redis nodes optional db db to use for redis nodes optional namespace namespace for redis nodes optional logger logger override optional retryfailure indicate if failures should be retried default true maxretries max retries for a failure default  safemode indicates if safe mode is used or not default true masteronly indicates if only redis master is used default false verifyrole verify the actual role of a redis node before every command default true the redisfailover client also supports a custom callback that will be invoked whenever the list of redis clients changes example usage redisfailover client new zkservers localhost localhost localhost  do and client and client onnodechange do and master slaves and logger info nodes changed master master  slaves slaves end manual failover can be initiated via redisfailover client manualfailover this schedules a manual failover with the currently active node manager once the node manager receives the request it will either failover to the specific server passed to manualfailover or it will pick a random slave to become the new master here s an example client redisfailover client new zkservers localhost localhost localhost  client manualfailover host localhost  port  as of redisfailover version   the notion of node and failover strategies exists all running node managers will periodically record snapshots of their view of the redis nodes the primary node manager will process these snapshots from all of the node managers by running a configurable node strategy by default a majority strategy is used this means that if a majority of node managers indicate that a node is unavailable then the primary node manager will officially mark it as unavailable other strategies exist consensus all node managers must agree that the node is unavailable single at least one node manager saying the node is unavailable will cause the node to be marked as such when a failover happens the primary node manager will now consult a failover strategy to determine which candidate node should be used currently only a single strategy is provided by redisfailover latency this strategy simply selects a node that is both marked as available by all node managers and has the lowest average latency for its last health check note that you should set the requirednodemanagers configuration option appropriately this value defaults to  is used to determine if enough node managers have reported their view of a node s state for example if you have deployed  node managers then you should set this value to  if you only want to accept a node s availability when all  node managers are part of the snapshot to give yourself flexibility you may want to set this value to  instead this would give you flexibility to take down  node managers while still allowing the cluster to be managed appropriately redisfailover is actively tested against mri    and    and    and jruby      mode only other rubies may work although i don t actively test against them note that by default the node manager will mark slaves that are currently syncing with their master as available based on the configuration value set for slave serve stale data in redis conf by default this value is set to yes in the configuration which means that slaves still syncing with their master will be available for servicing read requests if you don t want this behavior just set slave serve stale data to no in your redis conf file note that it s still possible for the redisfailover client instances to see a stale list of servers for a very small window in most cases this will not be the case due to how zookeeper handles distributed communication but you should be aware that in the worst case the client could write to a stale master for a small period of time until the next watch event is received by the client via zookeeper feel free to join zk gem on the irc

7496349, gikpopoverbackgroundview is a uipopoverbackgroundview subclass which uses images similar to those found in uikit to customise the background of a uipopovercontroller unlike most other third party implementations gikpopoverbackgroundview doesn t use separate background and arrow images so the appearance is seamless for all orientations images can be rendered by using a border color a gradient from color and a gradient to color or they can be provided as files the figure below shows the background images used by apple s default implementation the downright upright sidebottom and sidetop images are used when the popover is anchored to a control or rect in the corner or edge of a view a point in the solid dark blue area is defined as the stretchable region using standard uiedgeinsets the down up and side images require special handling to draw a background with an up arrow centered horizontally the up image must be stretched twice once on either side of the arrow arrows were created using shape layers and layer styles in photoshop the psd contains both x and x shapes for each arrow notes for each layer document the gradient overlay style s colour stops and values the default behavior of gikpopoverbackgroundview is to render the images needed using three colors you can change the colors used by creating a custom subclass and overriding the following methods objective c uicolor popoverbordercolor uicolor popovergradientfromcolor uicolor popovergradienttocolor alternatively if you would rather provide custom artwork for the images instead of

west  f secrets yml the yml file is safe for committing to version control your ci system embedding in native binaries copying to s publishing in a newspaper etc you can deploy these to your production servers by whatever mechanism is most appropriate for your environment but by far the easiest way to start is to simply include it in your deployments in the same way you would a configuration file you can use kms grants kms key policies or iam policies to manage access to the secrets kms grants enable you to delegate access to specific kms operations to some aws principal often your aws resources will be running with an iam role and thus often the easiest thing to do is to use kms grants to allow your iam roles to decrypt the appropriate values biscuit will create and retire those grants for you here s how to grant role and webserver and user and gordon the ability to decrypt the launch codes biscuit kms grants create grantee principal role and webserver f secrets yml launchcodes biscuit kms grants create grantee principal user and gordon f secrets yml launchcodes biscuit kms grants list f secrets yml launchcodes if you wish to allow a principal to decrypt all values encrypted under the same set of keys as the launch codes you can pass the all names flag biscuit kms grants create g role and webserver f secrets yml all names launchcodes you can also retire grants when they are no longer useful biscuit kms grants list f secrets yml launchcodes biscuit kms grants retire f secrets yml grant name biscuit ffedc launchcodes kms keys have their own policies see for more details if you have just a few users this is possibly the easiest mechanism to use to control access you can run biscuit kms edit key policy to edit the policy document across all of your regions at once iam policies are attached to a myriad of aws entities and they can also be used to enable access to kms operations see example you have a server running with a static aws access key and secret key you can give that server the ability to decrypt all values encrypted under a set of keys by attaching a standard user policy specifying kms decrypt as the action and the full key arns in the resource field note iam policies are global entities whereas kms keys are unique per region thus if you have a  region configuration any iam policies that explicitly grant access to kms keys will need to list all  region specific key arns biscuit does not manage iam policies for you if you wish to disallow iam policies from controlling access to your keys you can do so by passing disable iam policies to kms init when iam policies are disabled the only way to control access to keys is via grants and kms key policies for more information on how this works see the cloudformation template in the source repository and the key policies doc linked above each aws region has its own isolated kms instance this means that kms keys are per region resources and using a kms key requires communicating with the kms service in the region that holds that key when encrypting biscuit will attempt to encrypt the secrets by using all of the kms instances corresponding to the regions of the keys it is told to use this can incur cross datacenter traffic and is slower than using only the closest region when decrypting biscuit only needs to decrypt under one of the keys by default biscuit will prioritize using keys that are in the same region that the caller is in this is determined by the awsregion environment variable if you do not have an awsregion variable set biscuit will process keys in the order that they appear in the yaml file you can override this behavior by passing a aws region priority flag to the get or export operations here is an example invocation which prioritizes keys in ap north  and us west  biscuit get aws region priority ap north us west  f secrets yml launchcodes we recommend you make arrangements on your ec instances to either set the awsregion flag or pass a latency ordered list of regions via the aws region priority flag biscuit tracks keys across regions by using a label labels are embedded into the name of the cloudformation stack and a kms key alias in each region the default behavior is to use the default label but you can change this by passing the l flag example biscuit kms init l development labels are not persisted with the values and are not visible in the yml files they are an organizational tool to facilitate managing keys across regions and are passed as parameters to various commands here are some common scenarios biscuit kms init r us west  l development f development yml administrators role and developers users role and developers biscuit put f development yml sslkey i selfsigned key biscuit kms init l production f production yml administrators role and prod keymaster users role and developersuser and gordon biscuit put f production yml sslkey i wildcard key biscuit put f unittest yml a none databasepassword testing biscuit installs a kms key policy similar to the default policy recommended by aws this creates a distinction between administrators can administer the key but not necessarily encrypt or decrypt with that key they could if they wished replace the key policy with one that does allow them encrypt and decrypt but that would be unusual users can encrypt decrypt and generate ephemeral data keys in most cases you ll want to make your development team a user and possibly also administrators if you use biscuit kms init to create your keys you can use the administrators and users flag to set membership if you have already created the keys but want to change the policy use the interactive biscuit kms edit key policy to apply changes to all regions simultaneously the iam policy below is the smallest set of permissions needed to get started with biscuit using kms init be sure to replace the account number  with your own version     statement  sid allowkmslistaliasesandcreatekey

any features that are available in the iam policies kms key policy documents or kms grants are available to you biscuit does not expose command line flags to use all of the features but you can edit the various policies after they are created or override the default cloudformation template the kms key manager annotates the ciphertext with an containing the name of the value if you change the name of a value then the decrypting process will provide the wrong name to the decrypt operation and the decrypt will fail if you wish to change the name of a secret re encrypt it using the new name instead the biscuit kms init command allows you to override the built in cloudformation template with your own via the cloudformation template url parameter the only expectations that biscuit has about your kms configuration is that the keys have aliases of the form alias and biscuit label and that you have sufficient permissions to operate on the kms keys you can create the keys using whatever process is compatible with your organization s policies biscuit considers the rotation of secrets such as database passwords to be application specific features and thus does not have any native support for it however you can implement a rotation scheme appropriate for your situation simply by serializing that state as the secret and then read it with your application specific rotation behaviors biscuit put f secrets yml databasepasswords  pass   pass biscuit get f secrets yml databasepasswords and jq r toentries and map key and map tonumber and max and tostring

57999007, this project contains code to train a model that automatically plays the first level of super mario world using only raw pixels as the input no hand engineered features the training method is deep q learning with a replay memory i e the model observes sequences of screens saves them into its memory and later trains on them where training means that it learns to accurately predict the expected action reward values action means press button x based on the collected memories the replay memory has by default a size of k entries when it starts to get full new entries replace older ones for the training batches examples are chosen randomly uniform distribution and rewards of memories are reestimated based on what the network has learned so far each example s input has the following structure the last t actions each as two hot vectors two because the model can choose two buttons one arrow button and one of a and b and x and y the last t screenshots each downscaled to size x grayscale slightly cropped the last screenshot at size x grayscale slightly cropped t is currently set to  note that this includes the last state of the sequence screens are captured at every th frame each example s output are the action reward values of the chosen action received direct reward and discounted q value of the next state the model can choose two actions per state one arrow button up down right left and one of the other control buttons a b x y this is different from the atari model in which the agent could only pick one button at a time without this change the agent could theoretically not make many jumps which force you to keep the a button pressed and move to the right as the reward function is constructed in such a way that it is almost never  exactly two of each example s output values are expected to be non zero the agent gets the following rewards x difference reward and   if the agent moved to the right and   if it moved fast to the right  pixels or more compared to the last game state    if it moved to the left and   if it moved fast to the left  pixels or more level finished and   while the level finished animation is playing death   while the death animation is playing the gamma discount for expected and indirect rewards is set to   training the model only on score increases like in the atari paper would most likely not work because enemies respawn when their spawning location moves outside of the screen so the agent could just kill them again and again each time increasing its score a selective mse is used to train the agent that is for each example gradients are calculated just like they would be for a mse however the gradients of all action values are set to  if their target reward was  that s because each example contains only the received reward for one pair of chosen buttons arrow button other button other pairs of actions would have been possible but the agent didn t choose them and so the reward for them is unclear their reward values per example are set to  but not because they were truely  but instead because we don t know what reward the agent would have received if it had chosen them backpropagating gradient for them i e if the agent predicts a value unequal to  is therefore not reasonable this implementation can afford to differentiate between the chosen and not chosen buttons in the target vector based on the reward being unequal to  because the received reward of a chosen button is here almost never exactly  due to the construction of the reward function other implementations might need to take more care of this step the policy is an epsilon greedy one which starts at epsilon   and anneals that down to   at the k th chosen action whenever according to the policy a random action should be chosen the agent throws a coin i e   chance and either randomizes one of its two arrows other buttons actions or it randomizes both of them the model consists of three branches action history lists previously chosen actions added so that the network can e g learn that it should release the a button on the ground sometimes keeping it pressed non stop will prevent mario from jumping also added so that the network can learn to keep a pressed for long and high jumps this branch just uses one linear hidden layer screenshot history lists the screenshots of the state chain including the last state all screenshots are downscaled to x grayscale this branch is intended to let the network spot movements this branch uses a few strided convolutional layers some rnn architecture might be better here last screenshot this branch receives the last state s screenshot in x grayscale it is intended to let the network make in depth decisions based on the current state it has one sub branch that applies convolutions to the whole image it has one sub branch that applies convolutions to an area of interest using a spatial transformer to extract that area at the end of the branches everything is merged to one vector fed through a hidden layer before reaching the output neurons these output neurons predict the expected reward per pressed button overview of the network q architecture images and q png raw true q architecture the spatial transformer requires a localization network which is shown below localization net architecture images and localizationnet png raw true localization net architecture both networks have overall about  m parameters the agent is trained only on the first level first to the right in the overworld at the start other levels suffer significantly more from various difficulties with which the agent can hardly deal some of these are jumping puzzles the agent will usually just jump to right and straight into its death huge cannons balls to get past them you have to jump on them or duck under them big mario or walk under them small mario jumping on top of them is even rather hard for a human novice player ducking or walking under them is very hard for the agent due to the epsilon greedy policy which will randomly make mario jump and then instantly die high walls and tubes the agent has to keep a pressed to get over them again hard to learn and runs contrary to epsilon greedy horizontal tubes these are sometimes located at the end of areas and you are supposed to walk into them to get to the next area the agent has a tendency to instead jump on them because it loves to jump and then keep walking to the right hitting the wall the first level has hardly any of these difficulties and therefore lends itself to dqn which is why it is used here training on any level and then testing on another one is also rather difficult because each level seems to introduce new things like new and quite different enemies or new mechanics climbing new items objects that squeeze you to death etc ubuntu quite some time this is not an easy install around gb of disk space for the network and replay memory an nvidia gpu with  and gb of memory cuda version  or newer should do cudnn version  or newer should do make sure that you have lua   installed i had problems with   in torch make sure that you have gcc   or higher installed the emulator will compile happily with gcc   but then sometimes throw errors when you actually use it install torch make sure that the following packages are installed luarocks install packagename nn  cudnn  paths  image  display display is usually not part of torch install the spatial transformer module for torch switch to that directory cd stnbhwd compile the module luarocks make stnbhwd scm  rockspec install sqlite sudo apt get install sqlite libsqlite dev luarocks install lsqlite compile the emulator extract the emulator source code and open the created directory open source and src and libray and lua cpp and insert the following code under namespace ifndef luaok define luaok  endif ifdef luaerrgcmm registerlongconstant luaerrgcmm  luaerrgcmm constpersistent and constcs endif this makes the emulator run in lua   newer versions than beta of lsnes rr might not need this open source and include and core and controller hpp and change the function dobuttonaction from private to public simply cut the line void dobuttonaction const std string name short newstate int mode in the private block and paste it into the public block open source and src and lua and input cpp and before lua functions luainputfns at the end of the file insert int dobuttonaction lua state l lua parameters p auto core core std string name short newstate int mode p name newstate mode core buttons dobuttonaction name newstate mode return  this method was necessary to actually press buttons from custom lua scripts all of the emulator s default lua functions for that would just never work because core lua inputcontrollerdata apparently never gets set which btw will let these functions silently fail i e without any error again in source and src and lua and input cpp  at the block lua functions luainputfns  add dobuttonaction to the lua commands that can be called from lua scripts loaded in the emulator to do that change the line controllerinfo  controllerinfo  to controllerinfo  controllerinfo  dobuttonaction  dobuttonaction  switch back to source and compile the emulator with make you might might encounter problems during this step that will require lots of googling to solve no better way here if you encounter problems with portaudio deactivate it in the file options build if you encounter problems with something like libwxgtk then install package libwxgtk  dev and not version   dev as that package s official page might tell you to do from source and execute sudo cp lsnes and usr and bin and sudo chown root root and usr and bin and lsnes after that you can start lsnes by simply typing lsnes in a console window now create a ramdisk that will be used to save screenshots from the game in order to get the pixel values do the following sudo mkdir and media and ramdisk sudo chmod  and media and ramdisk sudo mount t tmpfs o size m none and media and ramdisk mkdir and media and ramdisk and mario ai screenshots note you can choose a different path then you will have to change screenshotfilepath in config lua note you don t have to use a ramdisk but your hard drive will probably not like the constant wear from lots of screenshots being saved cd into the created directory download a super mario world usa rom start lsnes from the repository directory by using lsnes in a terminal window in the emulator go to configure settings advanced and set the lua memory limit to mb only has to be done once configure your controller buttons configure settings controller play until the overworld pops up there move to the right and start that level play that level a bit and save a handful or so of states via the emulator s file save state to the subdirectory states and train name doesn t matter but they have to end in lsmv try to spread the states over the whole level start the display server by opening a command window and using th ldisplay start if that doesn t work you haven t installed display yet use luarocks install display now start the training via tools run lua script and select train lua expected training time maybe  hours less with good hardware about  m actions you can stop the training via tools reset lua vm if you want to restart the training from scratch e g for a second run  you will have to delete the files in learned and note that you can keep the replay memory memory sqlite and train a new network with it you can test the model using test lua don t expect it to play amazingly well the agent will still die a lot even more so if you ended the training on a bad set of parameters

start from different places to solve different problems shell is great lightweight and highly composable due to the abstraction of texts through pipes alfred is more like a luncher though nowadays it includes quite flexible work flows but it s interface still constrained by lists the idea behind assistant is try to use minimal concepts elements processor and card to solve problems but also at the same time make it highly either it will be very hard to control the modularity or it has too much hassle or mentally feel complicated but since reactjs s component is just like a card itself accepts data then return virtual dom elements that s it no more no less finally i feel relieved om push it into a higher level so you can write even less code avoid struggling another new jsx format have to say writing ui in om is the first time i feel fun  why there are two places for plugins where should i put my plugins the initial idea is to have a bunch of built in services they are all lived in src and assistant and services src and assistant and services it s also part of the git repo but if you have any personal plugins want to use you can create cljs file in plugins plugins folder leinbuild will also pick it up  why it shows a blank card sorry for that if you ever saw it that s probably because you don t have certain api keys for some services so the result is empty also if the card doesn t check the result properly it might render a empty card i ve added a new function valid config and a built in info card so before the processor runs it will check if the config exists if not it will put a error result into the channel then the info card will render and show the message i will try to make this config check process much simpler later on also i am very open to ideas on how to improve this tool to make it more useful build with  clojure and clojurescript

simple lines of code you can have this custom contact picker into your app in very little time i wrote this library to provide an update to the awesome thcontactpicker that our company used in the

can use the property nightmode to change all the ui element to black style like the below image objective c smileauthenticator sharedinstance nightmode yes smileauthenticator sharedinstance backgroundimage uiimage imagenamed nightmodebg objective c smileauthenticator sharedinstance passcodedigit  if you want to try this feature in the demo app before you try to change passcodedigit to new number make sure turn off the passcode switch because the keychain will save your old passcode even you delete the app so you have to clear the old passcode in keychain and then change new digit for test in ios because apple had not given the touchid api to developers only use passcode for authentication the main class is the smileauthenticator it has a property securitytype that has four types inputonce  inputtwice  inputthree  inputtouchid the reason for this name is that show the user input times inputonce for the user turn the passcode switch off user need input their passcode only one time for turn the password off inputtwice for the user turn the password switch on user need input their password once and re enter their password one more time for confirm it to match each other inputthree for the user change the password user need input their old passcode one time then input their new passcode one time and re enter one time for confirm a total of three times inputtouchid for the user open the app user can use touch id or input passcode to unlock use smileauthenticator sharedinstance presentauthviewcontroller to present view for authentication it simply add the following

3106157, snapshot stack view provides an easy means of decorating your uiimage s of any aspect ratio with a rendered matte frame and associated drop shadow it also may render your image to look as though it is the top photograph or snapshot within a stack or pile of shots best described with a screenshot features multiple display modes single or stacked respects image aspect scaling snapshots to fit within the views frame supports all image aspects landscape square portrait supports dynamic modification of views frame the image to display as the top snapshot and display mode background  snapshot stack view was developed for use in an ios application i m currently developing to decorate a uiimage for presentation to the user the application must display images of unknown and varying aspect ratios normally the effects rendered within the snapshot stack view to decorate a uiimage for display could easily generated be within photoshop as a layer to sit over and under the uiimage  however the aspect and dimensions of the image must be known and static hence not possible an alternative approach often used is to crop the images to a fixed aspect however this can lead to cropping important information from the image or destroying the general composition of a photograph which i also did not want to risk i use snapshot stack view to display a thumbnail to the user within an article for touching which then launches into a full screen image viewer i ve tried to convey the availability of either a single image or multiple using the snapshot stack view display modes single or stacked compatability  snapshot stack view has been developed to run on ios   or later deployment target and was developed using ios sdk   xcode    base sdk support for ios  was required for the target application i initially developed snapshot stack view for and hence snapshot stack view does not make use of any of the newer ios features such as blocks or more importantly automatic reference counting arc if using snapshot stack view within a newer arc enabled project disable arc selectively for compilation of snapshot stack view source files  select the project within xcode project navigator  select the required target from the list of targets  select the build phases tab  expand the list of compile sources and double click on the swsnapshotstackview m file to modify the compiler flags for this file  add fno objc arc to the compiler flags to use snapshot stack view within your project  add swsnapshotstackview h and swsnapshotstackview m to project your xcode project  ensure quartzcore framework framework is added to the project if not already  import the snapshot stack view header file to the destination view controller source using import swsnapshotstackview h  create an instance of the snapshot stack view class either within a xib using interface builder ib or programatically as you would any other view  set the desired image an existing uiimage to display using the image property within code  set the desired display mode using the displayasstack property within code refer to the demonstration application swsnapshotstackviewdemo and for example of use demonstration  a demonstration application is provided to illustrate and test the use of snapshot stack view demonstrating support for multiple images of differing aspect ratios image  landscape image  square image  portrait dynamic resizing of view s frame via slider selection and rendering of display mode single or stack via switch known issues  at time of release matte and shadow effects require scaling to suit smaller frame sizes otherwise effects can look exaggerated future work  if there is a particular enhancement you would like to up vote to increase priority for completion please leave

3076058, faye rails is a ruby gem which handles embedding faye s rack based server into the rails stack and providing it with access to controllers and views based on bindings and observers faye rails is used in production by a lot of folks none of whom are me as i don t use faye rails in my daily life i will not be responding to issues unless they have a corresponding pr if you d like to take over maintaining this project then get in contact due to the limitations of most rack based web servers available faye can only be run on thin however if you are using thin then you can add as many faye servers as you want to the rails middleware stack like so config middleware use fayerails middleware mount and faye  timeout  you can also pass a block to fayeserver which will be executed in the context of the faye server thus you can call any methods on faye rackadapter from within the block config middleware use fayerails middleware mount and faye  timeout  do can be defined anywhere like app and fayeextensions and mockextension rb class mockextension def incoming message callback callback call message addextension mockextension new you can also do some rudimentary routing using the map method config middleware use fayerails middleware mount and faye  timeout  do map and widgets and widgetscontroller map default block faye rails includes a controller for handling the binding between model events and channels with it s own dsl for managing channel based events class widgetcontroller fayerails controller you can subscribe to changes in models using the controller s observer dsl class widgetcontroller fayerails controller observe widget aftercreate do and newwidget and widgetcontroller publish and widgets  newwidget attributes the controller dsl elegantly wraps channel based aspects of the faye api so that you can easily group code based on specific channels class widgetcontroller fayerails controller channel and widgets do monitor subscribe do puts client clientid subscribed to channel monitor unsubscribe do puts client clientid unsubscribed from channel monitor publish do puts client clientid published data inspect to channel class widgetcontroller fayerails controller channel and widgets do filter in do puts inbound message message pass you can easily subscribe to a channel using the subscribe method inside your channel block like so class widgetcontroller fayerails controller channel and widgets do subscribe do puts received on channel channel message inspect often you ll find yourself running the rails environment without the server running eg when doing background job processing or running the console if you have any actions which use faye then you ll need to make sure that you have the eventmachine reactor running the easiest solution to this is to create an initialiser in config and initializers which calls faye ensurereactorrunning for workers in production you probably also want to make sure that you are using the redis engine for faye to ensure that multiple server instances see the same data config middleware use fayerails middleware mount and faye  engine type faye redis host localhost  timeout  do map and announce and somecontroller if you want to run faye rails on passenger make sure you are using passenger   standalone or passenger   on nginx   and for nginx with websocket support passenger on apache is not supported because passenger uses a multi process model you must use the faye redis backend add gem faye redis to your gemfile and configure your routes like this config middleware use fayerails middleware mount and faye  timeout  server passenger  engine type faye redis host localhost thanks to james coglan for the excellent faye bayeux implementetation and great support for faye users

66167360, first of all don t be afraid read plateau of productivity more importantly be patient a good read from peter norvig titled teach yourself programming in  years language war between python and r is one of the most frequently discussed topics among the data scientists and there doesn t seem to be a consensus on which one is better personally i used both r and python but for very different purposes i mainly use tidyverse packages dplyr and ggplot to carry out data analyses and data visualization while using python for web scraping task automations and building basic web applications in flask by now i have a pretty good working knowledge of the r language there are obviously many more things that i can learn in particular building and maintaining r packages as well as more advanced r materials yet the appeal of python has always been there for me for a few reasons it s a general purpose programming language so presumably it is a lot easier to learn good software engineering principles what are they though many of the data stacks are built using the tools in the python ecosystem etl using airflow front end using flask with restful api supports machine learning using scikit learn being able to use the same language for different parts of the data stack will bring prototypes closer to production to me the appeal of python is not necessarily the data analysis part r is already doing a great job on this rather the appeal of using python for data work is that you have a higher chance to see how data plays a role within the whole integrated technology stack knowing python is likely to make me a better end to end data scientist and better software engineer here is a great reddit answer that explains the intersection and disjoint union of the two languages beautifully i am a huge believer in learning by doing and there are a lot of opportunities on the job where i can hone my python skills through deliberate practice identify the top performers i think there are quite a few people at work e g dan f who can really be a role model for me to follow understand what they ve been through to get to where they are today what is their mental representation that i do not have about python build practice plans ideally based on the rough understanding of that mental representation define clear goals and select learning materials create deadline and milestones for the project estimate time required and come up weekly schedules augment these insights with your current level of mental representation of python to improve your understanding targeted practice if i force myself to switch over to python for data analysis data visualization modeling or contribute to our internal python data analysis packages i can maximize my time practicing this skill which is high leverage immediate feedbacks we have a culture of code reviews both for ic work as well as internal package work the former is harder because most ds on our team are in the r camp there s also the weekly python office hours that should be very useful find constant opportunities to get feedback as much as you can immediate learn to write pythonic code shorter term easiest to practice write re usable modular tested code for my data work and knowledge posts medium term harder to practice achieve efficiency and feature parity on data analysis using python compared to r longer term hardest to practice write tools being able to work on projects that span the entire data stack using python apply good software engineering principles to these projects outcome i want to move my data stack to python completely this means my day to day data analysis work will be done in python instead of r make my code as pythonic as possible become a contributor to airpy and tools and take on one bigger python project ml data viz etc curriculum i want do everything that i can to go through all the basic materials in pandas and matplotlib combo expose myself to functional

64205457, travis branch travis image travis url npm version npm image npm url build real restful apis without writing one line of code cool right now it works perfectly with mysql koa restql requires node v   or higher for partial es support npm install save koa restql const koa require koa const restql require koa restql let app koa let restql new restql sequelize models and and build apis from sequelize models app use restql routes get and user if you just have one database table and sequelize model both named user  just choose the right http method  to visit path as exactly same name as it using querystring in your url can add condition or limit for the request for more details read about querystring  request get and user response http and    partial content x range items   and  id  name li xin id  name zhang chi note request for a list will always respond an array this response example include necessary http headers to explain how partial content works if the response was just part of the list the api would like to response http status code   request get and user and  response id  name li xin note request path with id will always respond an object to define an   association with sequelize use model hasone  or model belongsto  request get and user and  and profile response id  userid  note this example is for hasone if the profile was an association defined with belongto  there should not be userid field to define an  n association with sequelize use model belongsto  request get and user and  and messages response id  content hello id  content world request get and user and  and messages and  response id  content world to define an n m association with sequelize use model belongstomany  basicly you can use the same way to request n n association as  n association  the difference is response request get and user and  and friends and  response id  name zhang chi  friendship id  userid  friendid  note restql will respond the target model with another model referred through option another noticeable problem is you can not do the following query with association path although it is supported by sequelize models user findall include models user association friends but fortunately you can implement the query with querystring like this get and user include b d friends read more  restql could do all crud operations for you just choose the right http method to access either the resource or the association path supported http verbs http verb and crud and and and get and read and post and create and put and create and update and delete and delete and supported http method with body http verb and list and single and and and and post and array and object and  and put and array and object and object and list path examples and resource and resource and id and association  association is  n relationship and resource and id and association  association is n m relationship single path examples and resource and id and resource and id and association  association is   relationship and resource and id and association and id  association is  n relationship and resource and id and association and id  association is n m relationship note put method must be used with unique key s  which means you can not use put method with a request body without an unique key to use post or put method you should put data into request body example post and user name li xin it s strongly recommended that use qs  to stringify nesting querystring s and this document will assume you will use qs to stringify querystring from javascript object qs stringify a  b  and and a  b  to understand restql querystring there are only  rules every keys in querystring not start with   will be directly used as where option for sequelize query example js and and query name li xin and and option for sequelize where name li xin every keys in querystring start with   will be directly used as sequelize query js and and query limit  and and option for sequelize limit  include option for sequelize query should be passed as string of association name js and and query include friends and and option for sequelize include models user association friends sometimes you want modify query in your own middleware to do so you should modify this restql query instead of this request query or this query  because the query must be parsed with the package qs  not querystring which is default package of koa there are at least  ways to implement the access control  add another middleware before request be handled by restql  add options on sequelize model associations  restql will handle the options this document will only talk about the nd way and the option was only support with associations not with models  to specify which association should not be accessed by restql add ignore option example js models user hasone models privacy restql ignore true   to specify an association should not be accessed by specific http method add the method to ignore

extensible rust struct to execute operations on almost any machine even if it does not have cuda or opencl capable devices collenchyma s abstracts over the different computation languages native opencl cuda and let s you run highly performant code thanks to easy parallelization on servers desktops or mobiles without the need to adapt your code for the machine you deploy to collenchyma does not require opencl or cuda on the machine and automatically falls back to the native host cpu making your application highly flexible and fast to build collenchyma was started at autumn autumn to support the machine intelligence framework leaf leaf with backend agnostic state of the art performance collenchyma makes it easy to parallelize computations on your machine putting all the available cores of your cpus and gpus to use collenchyma provides optimized operations through plugins that you can use right away to speed up your application writing custom operations for gpu execution becomes easy with collenchyma as it already takes care of framework peculiarities memory management safety and other overhead collenchyma provides plugins see examples below  that you can use to extend the collenchyma backend with your own business specific operations as collenchyma does not require the installation of various frameworks and libraries it will not add significantly to the build time of your application collenchyma checks at run time if these frameworks can be used and gracefully falls back to the standard native host cpu if they are not no long and painful build

17977082, day after day while working on your project keep an eye on performance metrics and get warnings for things you should optimize use this minimalist installation if you just want to launch some quick tests  create a directory for your grunt devperf installation anywhere you want let s call it devperf mkdir devperf cd devperf  install grunt globally npm install grunt cli g  install grunt devperf locally npm install grunt devperf  copy the example gruntfile js to the root of your devperf directory cp nodemodules and grunt devperf and demo and smallest config and gruntfile js and  then edit this copy of gruntfile js to insert your own list of urls it s done you can launch your first test with this command this plugin requires grunt    install the plugin npm install grunt devperf save dev once the plugin has been installed it may be enabled inside your gruntfile with this line of javascript grunt loadnpmtasks grunt devperf i recommand using it as a part of your continuous integration system but you can also simply use it locally while developping in your project s gruntfile add a section named devperf to the data object passed into grunt initconfig grunt initconfig devperf options urls type array of strings type integer default value  the number of times you want phantomas to call each page a higher number of runs could give a better accuracy but note that they are run in parallel and that your machine s bandwith may suffer type integer default value  the time after which phantomas should cancel a run type boolean default value false automatically opens the browser on the results page when the devperf task is finished type string default value and devperf this is the folder where the results will be generated including grunt phantomas reports it can be relative to your project and my folder you might want to add this folder to your gitignore file or it can be anywhere else in your file system and var and www and devperf in this example several urls are tested grunt initconfig devperf options urls numberofruns  timeout  openresults true resultsfolder and devperf then open the index html file with your browser to see the results it is located in the results folder and devperf and by default results snapshot about the results yes it looks like a console but it s a web page some metrics might have decimals because they are averages of multiple runs the link to the grunt phantomas report will give you tons of details very helpful for debugging the files size are not reliable sometimes gzipped sometimes not check issue  when a metric is greater than the limit the message is displayed metric and limit and message and and requests and  and too many requests i guess your site is slow isn t it csscount and  and too many css files use

total image size bytes is too high try image optimisation webfontcount and  and too many custom fonts tell the designer you don t want that notfound and  and number of  errors multiplerequests and

into variables dominserts and  and reduce number of dom insertions jquerysizzlecalls and  and reduce number of sizzle calls jquery dom queries headerssentsize and  and reduce size of headers sent cookies in the gruntfile you can change any of them by adding a warnings option this way grunt initconfig devperf options urls warnings  and and changing the limit for this variable variable jserrors  limit    and and changing the message variable jquerysizzlecalls  message i like this message best   and and changing the limit and the message variable domelementscount  limit  message dom elements

devperf variable jsoncount  limit  message i really care about having a small number of json requests  if you think one of these variables deserves a warning in grunt devperf don t hesitate to open an issue type object default value grunt initconfig devperf options urls phantomasoptions proxy localhost   no externals true this project is in early stage beta you can help by reporting any issue giving your feedback or coding new functionnalities write tests create profiles for phones and tablets force viewport and ua decrease some of the limits

9990694,  hlld is a high performance c server which is used to expose hyperloglog sets and operations over them to networked clients it uses a simple asci protocol which is human readable and similar to memcached hyperloglog s are a relatively new sketching data structure they are used to estimate cardinality i e the unique number of items in a set they are based on the observation that any bit in a good hash function is independent of any other bit and that the probability of getting a string of n bits all set to the same value is  and  n there is a lot more in the math but that is the basic intuition what is even more incredible is that the storage required to do the counting is log log n so with a  bit register we can count well into the trillions for more information its best to read the papers referenced at the end tl dr hyperloglogs enable you to have a set with about   variance using  bytes and estimate sizes in the trillions scalable non blocking core allows for many connected clients and concurrent operations implements bit wide hyperloglogs allowing almost unbounded counts supports asynchronous flushes to disk for persistence supports non disk backed sets for high i and o automatically faults cold sets out of memory to save resources dead simple to start and administer fast fast fast download and build from source cd hlld pip install scons uses the scons build system may not be necessary scons and hlld this will generate some errors related to building the test code as it depends on libcheck to build the test code successfully do the following cd deps and check    and and configure make make install ldconfig necessary on some linux distros then re build hlld at this point the test code should build successfully hlld can be configured using a file which is in ini format here is an example configuration file settings for hlld hlld tcpport  datadir and mnt and hlld loglevel info flushinterval  defaulteps   workers  then run hlld pointing it to that file hlld f and etc and hlld conf a full list of configuration options is below  here is a list of known client implementations here is a list of best practices for client implementations maintain a set of open connections to the server to minimize connection time make use of the bulk operations when possible as they are more efficient for long keys it is better to do a client side hash sha at least  and send the hash as the key to minimize network traffic configuration options  each configuration option is documented below tcp port integer sets the tcp port to listen on default  port same as above for compatibility udp port integer sets the udp port currently listened on but otherwise unused default  bind address the ip address to bind on defaults to     data dir the data directory that is used defaults to and tmp and hlld log level the logging level that hlld should use one of debug info warn error or critical all logs go to syslog and stderr if that is a tty default is info workers this controls the number of worker threads that are used defaults to  if many different sets are used it can be advantageous to increase this to the number of cpu cores if only a few sets are used the increased lock contention may reduce throughput and a single worker may be better flush interval this is the time interval in seconds in which sets are flushed to disk defaults to  seconds set to  to disable cold interval if a set is not accessed set or bulk  for this amount of time it is eligible to be removed from memory and left only on disk if a set is accessed it will automatically be faulted back into memory set to  seconds by default  hour set to  to disable cold faulting in memory if set to  then all sets are in memory only by default this means they are not persisted to disk and are not eligible for cold fault out defaults to  use mmap if set to  the hlld internal buffer management is disabled and instead buffers use a plain mmap and rely on the kernel for all management this increases data safety in the case that hlld crashes but has adverse affects on performance if the total memory utilization of the system is high in general this should be left to  which is the default default eps if not provided to create this is the default error of the hyperloglog this is an upper bound and is used to compute the precision that should be used this option overrides a given default precision defaults to    which is a precision of  only one of default eps or default precision should be provided default precision if not provided to create this is the default precision of the hyperloglog this controls the error in the size estimate this option overrides a given default eps defaults to  which is results in a variance of about   only one of default eps or default precision should be provided it is important to note that reducing the error bound increases the required precision the size utilization of a hyperloglog increases exponentially with the precision so it should be increased carefully by default hlld will listen for tcp connections on port  it uses a simple ascii protocol that is very similar to memcached a command has the following syntax cmd args r n we start each line by specifying a command providing optional arguments and ending the line in a newline carriage return is optional there are a total of  commands create create a new set a set is a named hyperloglog list list all sets or those matching a prefix drop drop a set deletes from disk close closes a set unmaps from memory but still accessible clear clears a set from the lists removes memory left on disk set and s set an item in a set bulk and b set many items in a set at once info gets info about a set flush flushes all sets or just a specified one for the create command the format is create setname precision prec eps maxeps inmemory  and  where setname is the name of the set and can contain the characters a z a z     if a precision is provided the set will be created with the given bits of precision otherwise the configured default value will be used if a maximum epsilon is provided that will be used to compute a precision otherwise the configured default is used you can optionally specify inmemory to force the set to not be persisted to disk if both precision and eps are specified it is not specified which one will be used generally only one should be provided as the other will be computed as an example create foobar eps   this will create a set foobar that has a maximum variance of  valid responses are either done  exists  or delete in progress the last response occurs if a set of the same name was recently deleted and hlld has not yet completed the delete operation if so a client should retry the create in a few seconds the list command takes either no arguments or a set prefix and returns information about the matching sets for example doing list foo will return a list of all sets with the foo prefix here is an example response start foobar      this indicates a single set named foobar with a variance of   precision  a  byte size a current size estimate of  the drop  close and clear commands are like create but only takes a set name it can either return done or set does not exist clear can also return set is not proxied close it first this means that the set is still in memory and not qualified for being cleared this can be resolved by first closing the set set is a very simple command set setname key the command must specify a set and a key to use it will either return done  or set does not exist the bulk command is similar to set but allows for many keys to be set at once keys must be separated by a space bulk setname key key key keyn the bulk and set commands can also be called by their aliases b and s respectively the info command takes a set name and returns information about the set here is an example output start inmemory  pageins  pageouts  eps   precision  sets  size  storage  the command may also return set does not exist if the set does not exist the flush command may be called without any arguments which causes all sets to be flushed if a set name is provided then that set will be flushed this will either return done or set does not exist  here is an example of a client flow assuming hlld is running on the default port using just telnet telnet localhost  list start create foobar set foobar zipzab bulk foobar zipzab blah boo list start foobar      drop foobar list start performance  although extensive performance evaluations have not been done casual testing on a  mbp with pure set operations allows for a throughput of at least mm ops and sec on linux response times can be as low as  s hlld also supports multi core systems for scalability so it is important to tune it for the given work load the number of worker threads can be configured either in the configuration file or by providing a w flag this should be set to at most  cpu count by default only a single worker is used references  here are some related works which we make use of

demo git cd extremely simple flux demo npm install npm start img and screenshot png you should see a button click it that s all according to flux an application should be divided into four parts views the ui layer actions messages sent from views e g mouseclick dispatcher a place receiving actions and calling callbacks stores a place managing the application s state and reminding views to update img and dataflow png the key feature of the flux architecture is one way unidirectional data flow  user interacts with views  views propagate an action triggered by user  dispatcher receives the action and updates the store  store emits a change event  views respond to the change event and update itself don t get it take it easy i will give you the details soon now let us follow the demo to

javascript and and actions and buttonactions js var appdispatcher require and dispatcher and appdispatcher var buttonactions addnewitem function text appdispatcher dispatch actiontype addnewitem  text text in the above code the buttonactions addnewitem method will use appdispatcher to dispatch the addnewitem action to the stores the dispatcher transfers the actions to the stores it is essentially an event hub for your application s views there is only one global dispatcher javascript and and dispatcher and appdispatcher js var dispatcher require flux dispatcher module exports new dispatcher appdispatcher register is used for registering a callback for actions javascript and and dispatcher and appdispatcher js var liststore require and stores and liststore appdispatcher register function action switch action actiontype case addnewitem liststore addnewitemhandler action text liststore emitchange break default and and no op in the above code when receiving the addnewitem action the callback will operate the liststore please keep in mind dispatcher has no real intelligence on its own  it is a simple mechanism for distributing the actions to the stores the stores contain the application state their role is somewhat similar to a model in a traditional mvc javascript and and stores and liststore js var liststore items  getall function return this items addnewitemhandler function text this items push text emitchange function this emit change module exports liststore in the above code liststore items is used for holding items liststore getall for getting all these items and liststore emitchange for emitting an event to the views the stores should implement an event interface as well since after receiving an action from the dispatcher the stores should emit a

eagleeyetest a test application for eagleeye testcaseconfigs configures of customized java system apis application s methods and native lib needed to be hooked for eagleeyetest follow the steps below  install eagleeye apk and enable this module in xposedinstaller  reboot the android device  set the property rw eagleeye fr uids to the uids of the applications you want to hook for java methods while for native hooking please set the property rw eagleeye nt uids  for example adb shell su c setprop rw eagleeye fr uids  and  for java hooking uids are splitted by and adb shell su c setprop rw eagleeye nt uids  and  for native hooking  restart the applications you want to hook eagleeye will read the rw eagleeye fr uids and rw eagleeye nt uids properties whenever the application loaded so if you want to hook other applications you only need set these two properties to the appropriate value and restart the applications  use adb logcat s eagleeye i to see the log information eagleeye hooks some java system apis by default refer to the classes under com mindmac eagleeye hookclass package and hooks and hookapis c under jni directory  if you want to hook other java system apis or applications methods you can configure as following  the java system apis can be customized by the frsysapis config refer to configure file format section for detail please push this configure file to the android device s directory and data and local and tmp and the default number of apis you can customize is limited to  and you can set the property rw eagleeye fr sysapinum to the value as you want  restart the application you want to hook eagleeye will reload the configure files when the application loaded please make sure both frsysapis config and frappapis config is readable by the hooked application use chmod if needed eagleeye utilizes adbi to hook native methods injection part is not needed  and hooks some native methods in system library by default please refer to hookapis c under jni directory currently you need to add extra native codes to hook methods you want please follow the steps below to hook more native methods the only file you need to touch is the hookapis c  declare the method you want to replace the target method parameter types and return type should be the same as the original method  initiliaze the hookinfo struct the variable name should start with systemhookinfo for methods in system libraries while it should start with customhookinfo for methods in application own libraries the second member is the library name of the method you want to hook key words lib at the beginning is needed the third member is the target method the forth and last member can be set to the declared method in step   implement the method declared in step  please refer to the hookapis c for detail implementaion scheme  execute ndk build under the eagleeye project directory to re build the native code  re install the modified eagleeye application to the device anti

implicit authorization does not require the client secret to be stored in the client regardless of which oauth flow you intend to incorporate into your android application the android oauth client library can be used in  simple steps  obtain an instance of oauthmanager by supplying the following  parameters an authorizationflow instance which automatically handles the oauth flow logic an authorizationuicontroller which manages the ui  call one of the  possible authorize methods on oauthmanager the call may be called from any thread either synchronously or asynchronously with an

588971, overscroll v    wednesday february th  copyright  jonathan azoff licensed under the mit license javascript selector overscroll options and selector the jquery selector targeting an element to apply overscroll to and options an optional javascript object that you may pass if you would like to customize the experience of the overscroll element below is a list of properties that you may set on the options object and their respective effect options showthumbs boolean true designates whether or not to show the scroll bar thumbs on the scrollable container options persistthumbs boolean false designates whether or not to fade the thumbs in and out options hoverthumbs boolean false designates whether or not to fade the thumbs in and out on hover options scrollleft integer undefined start the overscrolled element at a particular left offset defers to the browser default if not set options scrolltop integer undefined start the overscrolled element at a particular top offset defers to the browser default if not set options direction string auto the scroll direction of the overscrolled element by default it will auto detect the available directions you can also restrict direction by setting this property equal to vertical or horizontal options cancelon string selectinputtextarea an optional jquery selector to ignore on drag events note must match an element inside the overscrolled element options capturewheel boolean true designates whether or not to react to mouse wheel events options wheeldirection string multi the direction scrolled when the mouse wheel is triggered options are multi for multi directional scrolling horizontal for left and right scrolling and vertical for up and down scrolling options wheeldelta number  the amount of drift to apply per mouse wheel tick options scrolldelta number   the amount of drift to apply per drag interval options zindex number  the z index applied to the thumb elements options draghold boolean false locks onto the overscrolled element when dragging and doesn t let go when the mouse moves away from it options ignoresizing boolean false applies overscroll to the selected element even if it has no area to scroll javascript selector removeoverscroll and returns an overscrolled element to its pre overscroll state this is essentially a deconstructor for overscrolled elements global settings due to popular demand overscroll also exposes some of its internal constants for advanced tweaking you can modify any of these settings via jquery fn overscroll settings  here are the defaults javascript jquery fn overscroll settings capturethreshold  and and the number of mouse move events before considering the gesture a drag driftdecay   and and the linear friction coefficient for drift decay must be  driftsequences  and and the number of animation frames to constrain a drift to drifttimeout  and and the amount of time to imply the user is no longer trying to drift in ms thumbopacity   and and the default active opacity for the thumbs thumbthickness  and and the thickness in pixels of the generated thumbs thumbtimeout  and and the amount of time to wait before fading out thumbs apart from regular dom events overscrolled elements emit events to capture dragging and drifting boundaries to listen to these events simply listen for one of the following events on an overscrolled element and overscroll dragstart the beginning of the drag event happens when a user drags the overscrolled elemnent and overscroll dragend the end of the drag event happens after the drag but before the drift and overscroll driftstart happens right after overscroll dragend  but only if the drag had enough inertia and overscroll driftend the end of a drift happens after the drift effect completes javascript selector overscroll on overscroll dragstart  function console log drag started finer points  in order to get the most out of this plugin make sure to only apply it to parent elements that are smaller than the collective width and and or height of their children this way you can see the actual scroll effect as you pan the element while you can programatically control whether or not overscroll allows horizontal and and or vertical scroll it is best practice to size the child elements accordingly via css and not depend on programatic restrictions as of    you can call the overscroll constructor on a jquery element as much as you like without worrying about memory leaks what this means is that you may dynamically add elements to the overscrolled element and then re call the overscroll method to take into account the new height this would have been done programatically if dom elements supported the resize event alas only the window object supports this event as of    you can scroll in multiple directions using the mouse wheel you can also disable mouse wheel support as of    overscroll runs on the jquery  x x variants hence older browsers are no longer supported contributing  i  pull requests if you want to contribute please fork the code and submit a pull request if you want to take an active role maintaining overscroll just let me know i would wholeheartedly appreciate the help if you re having problems with using the project use the support forum at codersclan a note about amd

7045411, a highly tuned vim distribution that will blow your socks off this is my personal vim distribution that i have tweaked over time and evolved from a simple vanilla vimrc configuration to a full blown distribution that it is today while it is very easy to install this and get up and running on a brand new machine a use case i have  i recommend that you do not install this unless you fully understand everything that s going on inside scan it for tips and tricks or fork and customize it for your needs  clone this repository into your and vim directory  git submodule init git submodule update  mv and vimrc and vimrc backup  create the following shim and save it as and vimrc let g dotvimsettings let g dotvimsettings version  source and vim and vimrc  startup vim and dein will detect and ask you install any missing plugins you can also manually initiate this with call dein install  done the g dotvimsettings version is a simple version number which is manually edited it is used to detect whether significant breaking changes have been introduced so that users of the distribution can be notified accordingly since the distribution is just one file customization is straightforward any customizations can be added to the g dotvimsettings variable which will be used whilst sourcing the distribution s vimrc file here is an example this is the bare minimum let g dotvimsettings let g dotvimsettings version  here are some basic customizations please refer to the top of the vimrc file for all possible options let g dotvimsettings defaultindent  let g dotvimsettings maxcolumn  let g dotvimsettings colorscheme myawesomecolorscheme change the default directory where all miscellaneous persistent files go let g dotvimsettings cachedir and some and place and else by default language specific plugins are not loaded this can be changed with the following let g dotvimsettings plugingroupsexclude ruby  python if there are groups you want always loaded you can use this let g dotvimsettings plugingroupsinclude go alternatively you can set this variable to load exactly what you want let g dotvimsettings plugingroups core  web if there is a particular plugin you don t like you can define this variable to disable them entirely let g dotvimsettings disabledplugins vim foo  vim bar finally load the distribution source and vim and vimrc anything defined here are simply overrides set wildignore and and nodemodules and set guifont wingdings h this distribution will pick one of three combinations in the following priority  neocomplete nc and neosnippet ns if you have lua enabled  youcompleteme ycm and ultisnips us if you have compiled ycm  neocomplcache ncl and neosnippet ns if you only have vimscript available this can be overridden with g dotvimsettings autocompletemethod all temporary files are stored in and vim and cache  such as backup files and persistent undo c h move the cursor left c l move the cursor right jk

and recursively search all files for matching text uses ag or ack if found leader bd or bd will kill a buffer without changing the window layout motion on steriods makes search and replacing in your project a lot easier without relying on find and sed the loading time of this plugin is relatively heavy so it is not loaded at startup to load it on demand use leader vo  which opens the options

gist makes for writing html and css extremely fast for supported most filetypes tab will be mapped to automatically expand the line you can use c v tab to insert a tab character if needed for other features default plugin mappings are available which means c y is the prefix followed by a variety of options see help zencoding visualize the undo tree f to toggle amazingly fast fuzzy autocomplete engine combined with an excellent snippets library use c n and c p to go back and forward between selections and tab to expand snippets autocomplete and snippet support as a fallback choice when ycm

embedded shell mapped to c n  this will select all matching words and lets you concurrently change all matches at the same time i think i ve listed about half of the plugins contained in this distribution so please have a look at the vimrc directly to see all plugins in use i wanted to give special thanks to all of the people who worked on the following projects or people simply posted their vim distributions because i learned a lot and took many ideas and incorporated them into my configuration neobundle replaced with dein requires g dotvimsettings version to be defined disable all

39472416, ng forward is the default solution for people who want to start writing code using angular  conventions and styles that runs today on angular   and we are targeting four types of developers those who do not know if or when they will upgrade to angular  but who want all the benefits of organizing their code into components those who are starting angular  x projects today who want the easiest possible upgrade path to angular  and the best angular  code those who want a production safe way to prepare their angular  projects now for the easiest possible upgrade path later npm npm i save ng forward latest reflect metadata cdn from the words of pete bacon darwin petebacondarwin  angular  lead developer we suggest that ng forward could be used as part of an upgrade strategy which could also include ng upgrade i think the jury is still out on the very best strategy and i expect that there isn t a one size fits all solution we give equal sway to the two projects and i think there is value in developers considering both there are a variety of options available of which ng forward plays a part that ng forward can also be used even whether or not upgrade is your aim as it can make you ng code and development cleaner conversion options will depend on the specific library you re using and the author of that library however all of the following library s authors were involved in creating ng forward angulardecorators mikeryan which is also the codebase ng forward descended from aatscript hannahhoward angular now pbastowski ngdecorate mitranim the angular  x api has changed a lot and is hopefully starting to stabilize however obviously there will be more changes before final release our goal in ng forward will be to adjust to changes and provide the same level of deprecation support and breaking changes as angular  no definitely not in addition to some of the differences called out above there are several other features that are simply not possible to implement using angular  x as a base we re trying to add what we can over time but some things will just have to wait for angular  x here s an example of the steps you might take core contributors so far are mikeryan timkindberg petebacondarwin and hannahhoward

51442464, tagua vm is an experimental php  virtual machine that guarantees safety and quality by removing large classes of vulnerabilities thanks to the rust language  and the llvm compiler infrastructure  php is an extremely popular programming language on  php was used by more than  of all websites  however almost  known severe vulnerabilities have been recorded   whose almost  with a high cve score  this is inherent to any popular language but this is dangerous the goal of this project is to provide a php vm that guarantees safety and quality by removing large classes of vulnerabilities this will be achieved by using appropriated tools like rust and llvm rust is a remarkable language that brings strong guarantees about memory safety this is also a fast language that competes well with c it can also talk to c very easily llvm is a famous compiler infrastructure that brings modernity state of the art algorithms performance developer tool chains this project will solve three problems at once  providing safety and high quality by removing large classes of vulnerabilities and thus avoid the cost of dramatic bugs   providing modernity new developer experience and state of the art algorithms so performance   providing a set of libraries that will compose the vm and that can be reused outside of the project like the parser analysers extensions etc php  is a popular programming language today it powers a large part of the softwares we daily use on internet to list a few wikipedia facebook baidu yahoo or pinterest but also softwares you can install for your own purposes such as wordpress blog and website  drupal cms  joomla cms  magento commerce  shopify commerce  moodle learning  phpbb forum  on  php was used as the server side programming language on more than  of all websites  due to its unique position in the internet land a single vulnerability could have a huge impact economical imagine a shop a bug in the check out and products can no longer be sold or prices can be wrong this is critical for both a small or a big business note that this could be done by a malicious person privacy imagine a social network with hundreds of thousands enthusiasms a bug could leak private or personal information organisational imagine a music festival a bug in the event software can cause the cancellation of several months of works any other memory corruption segmentation fault data races all these class of bugs can be critical at so much levels php vms have recorded almost  known vulnerabilities   whose almost  vulnerabilities with a cve score greater or equal to  over   many of them and the most dangerous are about memory corruptions      or errors in parsers          the implications of these vulnerabilities are for instance remote code execution or denial of service two vectors that have important impact on a whole infrastructure this situation is real for any programming language like python  or java  nevertheless the criticality of a vulnerability is hardly linked to the popularity of the language in the case of php a single vulnerability can be dangerous in so many fashions however this is not the fault of the language itself all the listed vulnerabilities are due to the vms currently php has two major virtual machines vm zend engine  and hhvm  zend engine is the original vm it is mainly written in c and counts hundreds of contributors hhvm is mainly written in c and and and also counts hundreds of contributors hhvm by being more recent has a more state of the art approach and offers features like just in time compilation however both vm are written in unsafe languages where segmentation faults data races memory corruptions etc are very frequent and are severe errors and vulnerabilities as presented in the previous section tagua vm has a different approach it is written in rust  a language that guarantees memory safety threads without data races by using the move semantics data ownership borrowing lifetime  zero cost abstractions minimal runtime and as a bonus efficient c bindings in addition to being as fast as c it relies on llvm  for the compiler backend a solid state of the art research widely used modular and reusable compiler and toolchains technologies the class of vulnerabilities and class of bugs mentioned earlier are almost removed in the rust language this is part of its guarantees it does not avoid the need of complete test suites and security audits though due to the popularity of php this is extremely important to have a safe vm to run these applications since the old days of computer science numerous bugs and vulnerabilities in os like linux or bsd  in libraries like gclibc  in major programs like bash x org or php vms  have been found simply due to the lack of memory and type safety intrinsically rust enforces safety statically hence removing most of the memory vulnerabilities like segmentation faults or data races the quality of a project can be defined in various ways here is what we mean when speaking about quality documentation always up to date detailed as much as possible both for api and user documentations unit tests each function each structure each trait is unit tested no code lands without a unit test integration tests tagua vm is both a set of libraries and a binary the libraries part also has an integration test suites continuous integration each set of commits must compile and must not introduce a regression on all build targets the term  performance must be defined by saying  performance we mean speed and memory efficiency while speed is not the top priority memory is it is part of safety when safety is ensured and quality is high enough to detect most of the regressions we can safely patch the vm to get better performances if and when necessary obviously we commit to use the state of the art algorithms and structures to ensure excellent performances under rewriting to install tagua vm you must have rust see the rust installation page  and llvm see the llvm installation page  installed this is important to have llvm config and cargo available in the path cargo  is the rust package manager to build a release version cargo build release and target and release and tvm help to build a development version cargo build and target and debug and tvm help if installing rust and llvm on your machine is too much docker might be an alternative it provides everything needed to build test and run tagua vm first build the docker image docker build t tagua vm dev now it is possible to run a container from this image docker run rm it v pwd and source tagua vm dev if this command succeeds you are inside a fresh container to see if everything is fine you can start the test suite cargo test do whatever you want just respect the license and the other contributors your favorite tool is going to be cargo test to run all the test suites unit test suites integration test suites and documentation test suites in order to get an overview of what need to be done what is in progress and what has been recently done a kanban board is the documentation is automatically uploaded online at the following address to generate it locally please run the following command cargo doc open to get help on irc please join the official taguavm channel on tagua vm is designed as a set of libraries that can work outside of the project so far the following libraries are living outside of the project libtaguaparser   safe fast and memory efficient php parser lexical and syntactic analysers tagua vm is

9094838, imagelayout  a layout that arranges its children in relation to a background image the layout of each child is specified in image coordinates pixels  and the conversion to screen coordinates is performed automatically the background image is adjusted so that it fills the available space for some applications this might be a useful replacement for the now deprecated absolutelayout example image  try out the sample application or browse the source code of the sample application  for a complete example of use including in your project  if you re using eclipse with the adt plugin you can include imagelayout as a library project just create a new android project in eclipse using the library and folder as the existing source and add a reference to it to your application project if you use gradle to build your android project you can simply add a dependency for this library dependencies mavencentral compile com github manuelpeinado imagelayout imagelayout    add an element named tt com manuelpeinado imagelayout imagelayout and tt to your xml layout this element should have the following attributes and attribute and description and and and and and tt custom image and tt and the drawable to be used as the background for the view and in addition you can use the following optional attributes and attribute and description and and and and and tt custom fit and tt and determines how the background image is drawn accepted values are tt vertical and tt  tt horizontal and tt  tt both and tt and tt auto and tt the default check the fit attribute sample in the demo application to see these different modes in action and you can add child views to your imagelayout just like you would to any other viewgroup but instead of using the tt android layoutwidth and tt and tt android layoutheight and tt attributes to control the layout of children you should use the following and attribute and description and and and and note that depending of your application you will use a different combination of these attributes you might for example specify a value for tt custom right and tt in order to align the right side of your view with a given feature of the image and tt custom centery and tt to align the same view vertically with another feature also note that the size related attributes such as tt custom layoutwidth and tt are not mandatory if you don t specify any of them for a given dimension the view is measured in the traditional wrap content fashion you can have your imagelayout fill its parent by specifying tt matchparent and tt in both its tt android layoutwidth and tt and tt android layoutheight and tt attributes but since the aspect ratio of the image will typically differ from the aspect of ratio of the parent view this will result in a waste of screen real state in the form of blank margins around the image to prevent this simply use tt wrapcontent and tt in either tt android layoutwidth and tt or tt android layoutheight and tt this will cause the imagelayout to adopt a size which matches the aspect ratio of its image please note that the result of using tt wrapcontent and tt for both tt android layoutwidth and tt and tt android layoutheight and tt is unspecified who s using it  does your app use imagelayout if you want to be featured on this list drop me a line developed by  manuel peinado gallego manuel peinado gmail com copyright  manuel peinado licensed under the apache license version   the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license

16629453, mini a naked barebone php application mini and install and mini png an extremely simple php barebone and skeleton application built on top of the wonderful slim router and micro framework mini is by intention as simple as possible while still being able to create powerful applications i ve built mini in my free time unpaid voluntarily just for my personal commercial and private use and uploaded it on github as it might be useful for others too nothing more don t hate don t complain don t vandalize don t bash this needs to be said these days as people treat tiny free open source private scripts like they paid masses of money for them if you don t like it don t use it if you see issues please create a ticket in case you want to contribute please create a feature branch never commit into master thanks uses slim under the hood mini  and  are  native php built on slim restful routes extremely simple the entire application is just  php files plus external dependencies plus view templates uses twig as template engine others are possible via slim packages uses pure pdo instead of orm it s easier to handle basic crud functions create read update and edit and delete content basic search basic ajax demo optional shows emulated pdo sql statement for easy debugging optional compiles scss to css on the fly optional minifies css on the fly optional minifies js on the fly optional dev and test and production switch by default mini allows user access to and public folder the rest of the application including git files swap files etc is not accessible php   and modrewrite activated document root routed to and public tutorial below maybe useful simple tutorials on setting up a lamp stack on mit so feel free to use the project for everything you like mini a naked php skeleton application on top of slim mini and install and mini screenshot png if you are using vagrant for your development then you can install mini with one click or one command on the command line mini comes with a demo vagrant file defines your vagrant box and a demo bootstrap sh which automatically installs apache php mysql phpmyadmin git and composer sets a chosen password in mysql and phpmyadmin and even inside the application code downloads the composer dependencies activates modrewrite and edits the apache settings downloads the code from github and runs the demo sql statements for demo data this is  automatic you ll end up after and and  minutes with a fully running installation of mini inside an ubuntu   lts vagrant box to do so put vagrantfile and bootstrap sh from mini and vagrant inside a folder and nothing else do vagrant box add ubuntu and trusty to add ubuntu   lts trusty thar bit to vagrant unless you already have it  then do vagrant up to run the box when installation is finished you can directly use the fully installed demo app on     as this just a quick demo environment the mysql root password and the phpmyadmin root password are set to   the project is installed in and var and www and html and myproject you can install mini including apache mysql php and phpmyadmin modrewrite composer all necessary settings and even the passwords inside the configs file by simply downloading one file and executing it the entire installation will run  automatically see the bootstrap sh file for more infos and the default passwords keep in mind that this is quick dev setup not a perfect choice for production for sure this should work perfectly in every naked ubuntu   lts download the installer script make it executable is this necessary chmod and x bootstrap sh run it boooooom give it some minutes to perform all the tasks and yes you can thank me later sudo and bootstrap sh change the virtualhost file from documentroot and var and www and html to documentroot and var and www and html and public and from directory and var and www and html to directory and var and www and html and public don t forget to restart by the way this is also mentioned in the official slim documentation but inside public and index php edit the database credentials and fill in your values in install folder for example with phpmyadmin to create the demo database do a composer install in the project s root folder to fetch the dependencies and to create the autoloader see index php in and public the code below will basically show and view and subpage twig when user moves to yourproject com and subpage app get and subpage  function use app app render subpage twig same like above here but this time the model is passed to the route use app model  so it s possible to perform model actions database requests data manipulation etc action getallsongs is called the result songs obviously an array of songs passed to the view view and songs twig via songs songs app get and songs  function use app model songs model getallsongs app render songs twig  array songs songs inside the view the data is easily rendered like this the template engine twig is used here twig makes the view extremely simple and secure instead of doing this php echo htmlspecialchars song id entquotes utf  inside your html twig template you can simply do song id which automatically escapes and echos song id  for song in songs endfor the content of the model currently in mini model model php is extremely simple it s just some methods getting data when the model is initialized the database connection is created automatically just one time for sure a typical model method public function getallsongs sql select id artist track link from song query this db prepare sql query execute return query fetchall index php holds the configs for a development environment self explaining app configuremode development  function use app app config array debug true database array dbhost localhost  dbport  dbname mini  dbuser root  dbpass   to implement a production config simply copy the whole config block above and replace development with production slim can perform things at certain points in the lifetime of an application instance for example before everything is started mini uses this to perform sass to css compiling and css and js minification via external tools loaded via composer btw this is inside the above development environment configuration to make sure these actions are not made in production for sure app hook slim before  function use app sasscompiler run scss and  css and minifier new matthiasmullie minify css css and style css minifier minify css and style css minifier new matthiasmullie minify js js and application js minifier minify js and application js because it s simpler and more native feel free to use the slim handlers if this fits more your workflow because against popular opinion html and  does not support other http methods than get and post but the browsers themselves the most easy workaround is doing this with get and post please write a ticket if i m totally wrong here  and songs and is not the same as and songs  writing the initialization in the short syntax like app new slim slim array view has some issues and might eventually break your application using the syntax like in index php works fine it s possible to organize the view templates for sure simply do app render folder and folder and index twig when all the routes in index php are too much for you create a folder routers  put your route r s into files like xxx router php and load them like this routers glob and routers and router php foreach routers as router require router twig can get the url use this in the app twig parserextensions array new slim views twigextension  and then use baseurl in the view template or manually add the baseurl app hook slim before  function use app app view appenddata array baseurl and base and url and here and use it in the view template via baseurl sass compiler css and js minifier injecting stuff into app slim apps route url rewriting and installation

christopher kruegel giovanni vigna federico maggi in proceedings of the annual computer security applications conference acsac los angeles ca december  if you use grab n run in a scientific publication we would appreciate citations to the previous paper please use this bibtex entry inproceedings falsina grabandrun author luca falsina and yanick fratantonio and stefano zanero and christopher kruegel and giovanni vigna and federico maggi  title grab n run secure and practical dynamic code loading for android applications  booktitle proceedings of the annual computer security applications conference acsac  month december  year   address los angeles ca  and  and  grab n run is on line previous research has shown that many applications often need to perform dynamic class loading to implement for example non invasive self update features however research has also shown that it is really challenging to safely implement these features this is of particular importance as in this context one single mistake could open the application and therefore the entire device to serious security vulnerabilities  such as remote code execution the main goal of grab s run is to offer an alternative to the native android apis and its design enforces that even the most inexperienced developer cannot perform well known serious mistakes if you desire to suggest new features improvements criticisms or whatever i would be more than glad to hear any kind of constructive feedback d jar and apk containers can be either already stored on the device or automatically fetched from remote locations by gnr retrieved containers signatures are compared against a valid developer certificate only containers that are correctly signed are allowed to have their classes loaded dynamically this ensures integrity and developer authentication on all the retrieved containers developer certificates are retrieved from remote locations securely and cached on the mobile phone for future verifications cached classes containers and certificates used for the signature verification are stored into application private folders this prevents your application from code injection attacks at runtime gnr implements an effective caching system that speeds up its execution and at the same time enables it to work in most cases also when no connectivity is available transition to gnr is smooth for the application developer since its api where thought to be as close as possible to the standard api provided by the android framework when many containers are provided as sources for class loading grab n run performs a concurrent multi thread signature verification in order to limit the performance overhead gnr helps the application developer to implement silent updating on remote third party libraries in a secure and concise way this section explains how to setup grab n run as a library for your android applications modify the build gradle file in the app module of your android project by adding the following compile line in the dependencies body gradle dependencies and and grab n run will be imported from jcenter and and verify that the string jcenter is included in your repositories block compile it necst grabnrun grabnrun    resync your project to apply changes put the jar in the libs subfolder of your android project modify the android manifest of your application by adding a couple of required permissions manifest like containers and certificates like containers and certificates on sd card and manifest this quick use case gives you a taste on how to use gnr once you have added it to your project open a terminal and type the following command to generate a keystore and a keypair keytool genkey v keystore my tests key keystore alias testdevkey keyalg rsa keysize  validity  next export the public key into a certificate that will be used to verify your library code before dynamically loading it keytool exportcert keystore my tests key keystore alias testdevkey file certificate pem you should now see in the folder a certificate file called certificate pem you can publish the certificate wherever you like as long as https protocol is used and everyone can access this location from the web let s say that in your ide i e  the android development tools adt you have an android project called loaderapp from which you want to load some

10564061, is a bunch of helpers for it isn t a library per se you can use any of those helpers independantly this makes it very light to include these in your own code there is a webaudiox js which bundle them though this is provided for convenience it is just the concatenation of all the helpers here is a boilerplate a good example to start with it initializes the audiocontext the lineout and downloads a sound and and create webaudio api context var context new audiocontext and and create lineout var lineout new webaudiox lineout context and and load a sound and play it immediatly webaudiox loadbuffer context sound wav  function buffer and and init audiobuffersourcenode var source context createbuffersource source buffer buffer source connect lineout destination and and start the sound now source start  and script download the helpers with a usual script the easiest is to get in and build directory bower install webaudiox no real requirements there are no external dependancies well webaudio api must be available obviously currently chrome firefox ios and opera support it feel free to send pull requests i love little helpers which are useful v   bower support you can try with bower install webaudiox v   initial release is a plugin by erichlof it provides a simple mean to use convolvers thus you can simulate being thru an old telephone in a hall or in a tunnel here is all the helpers provided and their respective api the source contains a jsdoc which is authoritative this helper displays a visualisation of the played sound in real time it uses the the visualisation is composed of  parts a fft histogram a waveform and a volume it is useful to debug or simply to display sounds on screen it has been widely inspired by this by the excelent the source itself it shows a basic usage of this helper first you create the object var analysercanvas new webaudiox analysercanvas analyser canvas then every time you want to draw on the canvas just do analysercanvas update this helper makes an average on a bytefrequencydata from an clear i guess not ok ok audio vocabulary may appear criptic let s rephrase in layman term to extract the frequency of the sound all that in real time it is often used to detect pulse in some frequency range like detecting pulse in the low frequencies can be a easy beat detector the source itself it shows a basic usage of this helper javascript and and create the object var analyservolume new webaudiox analyservolume analyser var rawvolume analyservolume rawvalue var smoothedvolume analyservolume smoothedvalue it is possible to directly compute the raw volume javascript var rawvolume new webaudiox analyservolume compute analyser width offset and and rawvolume is a number of the computed average width is optional and default to analyser frequencybincount offset is optional and default to  this helper converts a to a normalized the destination array is normalized because its values are garanted to be between  and  this function is designed to works even if the destination array length is different from the source array s length this is mainly aimed at convering and normalizing input when you are playing with frequency spectrum or other aspects of the source itself it shows a usage of this helper thru here is a basic usage note that dstarray must be reallocated javascript webaudiox bytetonormalizedfloatarray srcarray dstarray here is a usage where it is used to normalize an histogram before displaying it for examples javascript and and bytesfreq is from a analyser getbytefrequencydata bytesfreq and and histogram is destination array e g new floatarray  webaudiox bytetonormalizedfloatarray bytesfreq histogram this helper provides a main line out with the good practices so it provides a clipping detection and a dynamic compressor to reduce clipping to improve sound quality additionaly it provides some tools useful in real life cases such as the ability for the user to mute the sound its is useful when the user is at the office or any place where it isn t polite to have a loud computer another thing there is a muteifhidden feature so if the browser tab is hidden the sound is mute using and obviously ability to tune the volume globally for all sounds the source itself it shows a basic usage of this helper todo this link is broken now let s see it s api javascript var lineout new webaudiox lineout context javascript lineout volume   use lineout destination as you would use context destination javascript source connect lineout destination javascript if lineout ismuted true console log sound has been muted by user typically when the user click on the mute button you want to toggle the mute status javascript lineout toggemute the vendor prefix so you don t have to typically it contains code like javascript window audiocontext window audiocontext and and window webkitaudiocontext the source itself it shows a basic usage of this helper is a library to generate procedural sound very  bit kindof sound it is usefull because you can generate lots of different sound easily without downloading anything the source itself it shows several sounds generated by this extension it shows a basic usage of this helper let s see how to use it first you create a var context new audiocontext now you get the famous lib parameter from from lib  you will generate a javascript var lib square                             var buffer webaudiox getbufferfromjsfx context lib now we are all ready to play a sound so let s do that javascript var source context createbuffersource source buffer buffer source connect context destination source start  this helper loads sound it is a function which load the sound from an url and decode it the source itself it shows a basic usage of this helper todo this link is broken javascript webaudiox loadbuffer context url function buffer and and notified when the url has been downloaded and the sound decoded  function and and notified if an error occurs in real life cases like game you want to be sure all your sounds are ready to play before the user start playing so here is way to schedule your sound downloads simply there is global onload callback webaudiox loadbuffer onload this function is notified everytime loadbuffer load something you can overload it to fit your need here for an javascript and and context is the webaudio api context and and url is where to download the sound and and buffer is the just loaded buffer webaudiox loadbuffer onload function context url buffer and and put your own stuff here and and additionally there is webaudiox loadbuffer inprogresscount it is counter of all the loadbuffer in progress it useful to know is all your sounds as been loaded with the normal audiocontext decoding e g an mp file takes just as long as the mp file lasts so if your mp file s duration is   minutes then your decompression or analyzation etc takes   minutes which might be unbearable for your app offlineaudiocontext allows faster than realtime decompression for example javascript var audiocontext window audiocontext and and window webkitaudiocontext var offlineaudiocontext window offlineaudiocontext and and window webkitofflineaudiocontext this context new audiocontext this loadercontext new offlineaudiocontext    and and  to  cd  this is useful lf you have a three js scene and would like to play spacial sound in it when a sound is played in d space there are  actors the listener which hears the sound the sound source which emits the sound each of them must be localised in d space in practice when you use it with three js you need to constantly update the position of the listener and all the sound sources first in your init you instance the updater objects then at each iteration of your rendering loop you update all the positions the source itself it shows a basic usage of this helper it shows a basic usage of this helper here is the api details first let s localise the listener most of the time it will be the the viewer camera so you create a listenerobjectdupdater for that javascript and and context is your webaudio context and and objectd is the object which represent the listener var listenerupdater new webaudiox listenerobjectdupdater context objectd then you call update everytime you update the position of your objectd listener javascript and and delta is the time between the last update in seconds and and now is the absolute time in seconds listenerupdater update delta now now let s localise a sound source a sound source is localised only if it has a so you create a pannerobjectdupdater for that javascript and and panner is the panner node from webaudio api and and objectd is the object which represent the sound source in space var pannerupdater new webaudiox pannerobjectdupdater panner objectd then you call update everytime you update the position of your objectd javascript and and delta is the time between the last update in seconds and and now is the absolute time in seconds pannerupdater update delta now var panner context createpanner var position new three vector  webaudiox pannersetposition panner position var panner context createpanner var objectd new three objectd webaudiox pannersetobjectd panner objectd it aims at making it aims to provide easy to use api for the common cases seen by gamedevs yet by exposing its internals it conserves the flexibility to fit your own needs the source itself it shows a simple usages of gamesounds first we init gamesounds var sounds new webaudiox gamesounds then we create a sound and load it from a url sounds createclip load mysound ogg  function soundclip and and here the sound is loaded we are all ready to play a sound so let s do it soundclip play this will create a source  i e an source of our soundclip a playing version of our sound each source is independant thus you got the flexibility to change its parameters during the playing of it e g change its location its volume whatever you want first thing is to instanciate the object itself it will keep the webaudio api context var gamesounds new webaudiox gamesounds it will expose the following properties it updates the gamesounds delta is the number of seconds since the last update it is needed to update gamesounds it is used to update d listener it is used to update all registered webaudiox gamesound too this will create a sound options is the default options for threex gamesource this is a simple alias for function createclip options return new webaudiox gamesoundclip this options it is used for sound localisation it is setting the position of the listener first you create the object like this var soundlistener new webaudiox gamesoundlistener gamesounds then you periodically update it like that soundlistener update delta this is a sounds localisation function it will place the audio listener at position if it is a three vector  it will directly use this position if it is a three objectd  it will use the position of this object this is a sounds localisation function the listener will start follow this three objectd the listener will stop following the objectd the arguments of the constructor are gamesounds is a webaudiox gamesounds instance options is the threex gamesoundsource options this is optional this load a sounds from an url once the sound is loaded onload gamesound is notified if an error occurs during the load onload is notified it exposes gamesound loaded boolean if it is true the sound is loaded false otherwise it exposes gamesound buffer it is the loaded buffer once it is loaded or null otherwise it updates the sound it is currently needed only if you use d localisation for this sounds delta is the number of seconds since the last iteration of the rendering loop register this sound into the bank of gamesounds with this label every label is unique into a gamesounds soundclip unregister unregisters the sound from gamesounds bank this will cause this sound to be automatically updated by gamesounds this will create a threex gamesoundsource using this options this will create a threex gamesoundsource using this options and then call play on this soundsource it will one source for this soundclip it will be played only once everytime you play a gamesound it is handled by an independant source this you can controls them independantly e g you can have various volume how strong is an impact you can play sound at various fixed locations or following different d objects here are all the options you can set options volume controls the volume of this utterance it will create a utterance gainnode if you wish you can access gainnode directly change the gain during the utterance options at receives a three js position it may be three objectd or directly a three vector the utterance will be played at this position it will create a pannernode if needed and update it according to the d object position options follow receives a three objectd as arguments this d object will be followed by the utterance it will create a pannernode if needed and update it according to the d object position additionnaly it exposes utterance stopfollow to stop following a d object options loop set the loop parameter in the sourcebuffer it will start play the sound in delay millisecond default to  ms it will stop playing the sound in delay millisecond default to  ms webaudiox gamesounds js is included in webaudiox js build it you wish not to use this build this file depends on you want to use the sound localisation here are the various examples port examples from webaudio js

5148035, bower install cocktail npm install backbone cocktail mixins are simply bare bones javascript objects that provide additional functionality to your backbone objects think of them as bags of methods that will get added to all instances of your objects here s an example mixin that implements selectability on a view based on a model s selection state window mymixins mymixins selectmixin initialize function this model on change selected  this refreshselect this events click toggleselect render function this refreshselect refreshselect function this el toggleclass selected  this model get selected toggleselect function this model set selected  this model get selected as you can see nothing special just a bag of functions obviously the bit about window mymixins is just a suggested pattern for organizing your mixins and yes having models know about view state like selection is often an anti pattern but it makes for a simple intelligible example once you have your mixins defined including them in your backbone object definitions is a one liner var myview backbone view extend events click mychild mycustomhandler initialize function  render function  etc cocktail mixin myview mymixins selectmixin mymixins someothermixin now all instances of myview will have the selection behavior defined in the selectmixin var view new myview view toggleselect and and works alternatively  you can lazily mix into your views and models like so var myview backbone view extend events click mychild mycustomhandler initialize function cocktail mixin this mymixins selectmixin mymixins someothermixin render function  etc this looks a bit cleaner if you can t monkeypatch described below in addition this syntax gives you the flexibility to mix in certain methods in particular states of your application for example maybe you have an interface that you d like an object to assume on login and logout or in the presence of another object like a flash embed by default as of    cocktail no longer messes with backbone s built in extend method however if you don t mind some monkey patching then running cocktail patch backbone before you define any classes will allow you to mixin code like this var myview backbone view extend mixins mymixins selectmixin mymixins someothermixin  etc or like this for coffeescript users class myview extends backbone view mixin mymixins selectmixin with the monkey patch installed mixins are just a convenient bit of configuration at the top of your class definitions note that the patch should only be applied once whether or not you re monkey patching backbone you can also use named mixins by registering them with cocktail cocktail mixins select mymixins selectmixin other mymixins someothermixin and and without monkey patching cocktail mixin myview select  other  mymixins yetanothermixin and and with monkey patching var myview backbone view extend mixins select  other  mymixins yetanothermixin  etc in the example above both myview and selectmixin both defined initialize  and render what happens with these colliding methods cocktail automatically ensures that methods defined in your mixins do not obliterate the corresponding methods in your classes this is accomplished by wrapping all colliding methods into a new method that is then assigned to the final composite object note cocktail will ensure that if you accidentally try to mix in the same method it will not result in a collision and will do nothing let s take a concrete example class x implements render and mixes in mixins a  b  and c in that order of these only a and c implement render when render is called on instances of x the implementation of render in x is called first followed by the implementation in a and then c in this way the original implementation is always called first followed by the mixins the return value of the composite function is the last non undefined return value from the chain of colliding functions to be clear let s say x mixes in a and b say x implements a method foo that returns bar  a implements foo but returns nothing i e undefined is implicitly returned and b returns baz then instances of x will return baz the last non undefined return value from foo s x rarr a rarr b collision chain when both a mixin and the class define a hash cocktail will merge the hashes together in the case of a key collision keys and values defined in the hash on the class take precedence followed the hash on the first mixin then the second mixin etc note that this includes the events hash as a result mixins are allowed to add new event listeners subclass hierarchies with mixins should work just fine if a super class mixes in a mixin then all subclasses will inherit that mixin if those subclasses mixin additional mixins those mixins will be folded in to the subclasses and collisions will be handled correctly even collisions with methods further up the class hierarchy however if a subclass redefines a method that is provided by a mixin of the super class the mixin s implementation will not be called this shouldn t be surprising the subclass s method is further up in the prototype chain and is the method that gets evaluated in this circumstance you must remember to call subclass super themethod apply this to ensure that the mixin s method gets called cocktail requires running tests open up spec and specrunner html in your favorite browser contributing you can contribute a new build by issuing the terminal command grunt within the root folder future changes to backbone could break cocktail or obviate its need if the latter happens great if the former let me know and i ll try to ensure compatibility going forward

11860895,  atomic web development combining the power of npm browserify rework and more to build small fully encapsulated client side modules atomify opts cb just like its constituent pieces atomify is a function that takes an opts object and a callback function opts assets used to configure opts js assets and opts css assets simultaneously and identically see links above opts server options to be passed to the development server just like the callbacks used by atomify js and atomify css  but with a third parameter to denote the type of bundle being provided cb err src type where type is either js or css and and build js var atomify require atomify var jsconfig and entry js and and shorthand for entry and entry js var cssconfig entry and entry css  variables background f function cb err src type if type js and and do something with js source bundle else and and do something with css source bundle atomify js jsconfig css cssconfig  cb if you don t need to access the bundled source simply provide a file path as the output property in your options and atomify will write the file for you as a convenience you can access atomify js and atomify css via properties on the atomify function var atomify require atomify atomify js require atomify js atomify css require atomify css atomify includes a development server that provides things like on the fly bundling and live reload and browser sync support to make your workflow lightning fast atomify server opts provides basically the same api as atomify itself with a few extra options documented below added in the biggest difference of course is that instead of writing to a file or calling a callback function atomify server responds to http requests the server can also be configured by including a server property in the opts object when calling atomify opts just like with atomify  the options passed to atomify server are expected to have a js and and or css field when the entry option of either of these is requested the server will return the results of bundling your code if you don t want to include the actual path to your entry file in your html you can also provide an alias option field when the alias path is requested the server will bundle using your entry path you can provide server specific options in this field opts server port port to listen on default  opts server open if provided open the url in your default browser opts server hostname use your machine s local hostname via node s os hostname instead of localhost ideal for accessing pages from mobile devices on the same lan aliased as h opts server lr enables live reload support by injecting the live reload script into any html pages served supports the following sub properties port port for browsersync server to run on default  quiet suppress file change notifications on the command line default false verbose log browsersync s debuginfo to the console default false opts server sync shortcut for specifying opts server lr as sync true aliased as s opts server html override the default html served at and default pass either a filepath or a function if you pass a function you ll be passed one options argument with the urls to the bundled js and css you should insert those into your html and return a string server html function html paths done and and it s important to include the body tags so that the livereload snippet from browsersync can be inserted var html body and link rel stylesheet href and paths css and and h your current url and paths request and and h and and body and and you can return an error if something went wrong done null html if you pass a filepath the bundled js and css will automatically be inserted at the bottom of your file however you can place the strings atomifycss and atomifyjs when you want the relevant paths inserted to override this behavior opts server spamode when set to true  the default html will always be served this is useful for single page apps that have a router in order to support atomify turtles all the way down you can also specify your configuration in package json simply recreate an opts object structure in json with atomify as the key omit output properties if not a top level package atomify server lr true js entry index js  output dist and bundle js css entry index css  plugins rework plugin inline  src and assets  rework default unit output example and bundle css if you supply the debug d or output o args outside the js and css contexts they will apply to both js and css bundles when providing an output argument that applies to both omit the file extension and it will be applied correctly for you you can also configure aliases by appending them after a in your entry field like j entry js and bundle js get a complete listing of options by running atomify help atomify j entry js bundle js atomify j e entry js e other js o bundle js d w atomify j entry js t funkify c entry css o bundle atomify j src and entry js bundle js c styles and entry css bundle css server open any top level args js css server passed on the command line will override the corresponding configuration defined in package json non conflicting top level items will be merged with package json configuration npm install atomify

musictoingest allcodes json  ingest the generated json python fastingest py b allcodes json the b flag creates a file named bigeval json that can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the fingerprint and server see below the fastingest script is very memory intensive for large dump files you may run out of memory while processing them if this is the case then you can split the dumps into smaller chunks using the splitdata py script python splitdata py and downloads and echoprint dump json this will create  new dump files input  json input  json etc import as above with fastingest publicly available fingerprint data is available under the echoprint database license if you want to use this data use the fastingest py tool to import this data like above python fastingest py b and downloads and echoprint dump json you can run fastingest many times on one or more machines as long as you update the configuration information for solr and tokyo tyrant in fp py we provide an evaluation tool bigeval that can be used to test the accuracy of the fingerprint and server run bigeval py without any arguments to get a usage statement this command will test  random files python bigeval py c  for every  files tested bigeval will print out a line that looks like this pr   car   far   frr   tn  err api  fp a  tp  err codegen  fp b  err data  total  fn  err munge  this is what the fields mean pr probability of error a weighted measure of the overall goodness of the fp car correct accept rate probability that you will correctly identify a known song far false accept rate probability that you

not actually there tp true pos correct song chosen tn true neg song correctly identified as not there fn false neg song there but we said it wasn t if an error occurs during the matching a message describing the error will be printed use the p flag to print extra information about the scores obtained from solr when an error occurs to see how the server is choosing its winner use   file to test a single file and print its score information a number of munge parameters are available to bigeval these parameters alter the input file before generating a fingerprint to simulate noisy signals run bigeval py help to see the available options these options require mpg and ffmpeg to be installed you can test for true negatives by creating a list of tracks that you know are not in the database find and newmusic type f newmusic name the file newmusic and put it in the same directory as bigeval py you can run echoprint in local mode which uses a python dict to store and index codes instead of solr you can store and index about k tracks in gb or so in practice using this mode this is only useful for small scale testing each fp py method takes an optional local kwarg

34466842, android library to create complex multi state animations demo animation docs and images and demo gif a class that allows for complex multi state animations using android s animationdrawable it supports both oneshot and looped animation sections transitions between sections can be defined and will play automatically when moving between the defined states state transitions can be queued asynchronously and the library will take car of smoothly starting the next animation once the current section is complete add the following dependency to your gradle build file gradle dependencies compile com getkeepsafe android multistateanimation library    each animation consists of a series of states a state has some metadata and a list of frames to draw a state can also define transitions from other states a transition is a list of frames that will be played when moving directly from a specified state to the state where the transition is defined an animation can be defined either with a json file included as a raw resource or directly in java code using builders and and the id is used in code to specify a section to play multistateanimation sectionbuilder firstsection new multistateanimation sectionbuilder firstsection and and if true this section will play once and stop otherwise it and and will loop indefinitely setoneshot false and and the number of milliseconds

assist in generating the json for an animation to use it place the frames for each section of the animation in a separate folder the pass those folders to the script for example to generate the json file above create a folder structure like this    firstsection       firstsection png       firstsection png    firsttosecondtransition       firsttosecondtransition png       firsttosecondtransition

your filesystem to generate the json file run the script with the folders as arguments python generateanimationjson py firstsection and secondsection and firsttosecondtransition and nothingtosecondtransition and output sampleanimation json the script will ask a series of questions about each section and save the resulting json file to sampleanimation json you can run python generateanimationjson py help to see a full list of arguments once the animation object is created via one of the above methods you can use queuetransition and transitionnow from the gui thread to
