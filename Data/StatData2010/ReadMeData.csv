438706, what is norbert  norbert is a library which provides easy cluster management and cluster aware client and server networking apis implemented in scala norbert wraps zookeeper netty and uses protocol buffers for transport to make it easy to build a cluster aware application a java api is provided and pluggable load balancing strategies are supported with round robin and consistent hash strategies provided out of the box  norbert can be built using maven using norbert for cluster management  norbert provides a simple api to interact with a cluster and to receive notifications when the cluster topology changes in norbert a cluster is a named set of nodes a node is norbert s representation of a service which can handle requests a node contains  a numerical id assigned by the client creating the node norbert does not auto assign node ids  the url to use to contact the node  optionally one or more partition ids representing the particular partitions the services handles if an application is designed around a partitioned data set or workload then each node can be assigned partition ids these partition ids can be used by norbert s networking layer s partitioned load balancer functionality the set of member nodes in a given cluster is reliably stored in zookeeper additionally a node can advertise that it is available to process requests in general a node can be in one of three states  a member of the cluster but not advertised as available in this state the other nodes in the cluster know the node exists but should not attempt to send it traffic  not a member of the cluster but available in this state the node can handle requests but it is unknown to the other nodes in the cluster  a member of the cluster and available in this state the node is known in the cluster and it should be sent traffic number  is most commonly the case that an administrator has specified the node in the cluster metadata but the node is currently offline number  is useful when the node is online but for whatever reason an administrator does not want it to receive traffic the easiest way to define a cluster is to use the norbertclusterclientmain command line program which can be found in the examples sub directory at the prompt you can type nodes lists all the nodes in the cluster join nodeid hostname port partitionid partitionid adds a new node to the cluster with the given id host port and partitions ids leave nodeid removes the node with the given id from the cluster under the covers the norbertnetworkclientmain command line program simply uses the addnode and removenode methods on the cluster trait these methods create znodes in zookeeper which store the node s hostname and port and partition mapping metadata custom tools can be written using those methods in your own code norbert provides two ways to interact with the cluster  the clusterclient trait provides methods for retrieving the current data about the cluster  the clusterlistener notification system allows you to register a clusterlistener with the cluster the cluster will then send notifications to your clusterlistener s whenever the state of the cluster changes object norbertclient def main args array string val cc clusterclient norbert  localhost     cc awaitconnectionuninterruptibly  cc nodes  cc addlistener new myclusterlistener  cc marknodeavailable   cc shutdown   the clusterclient companion object provides an easy way to instantiate and start a clusterclient instance  before using the clusterclient you must wait for it to finish connecting  at this point the cluster is usable and you can retrieve the list of cluster nodes  alternatively instead of step  you can register clusterlistener s with the cluster and they will be sent notifications when the state of the cluster changes  optional if you are a member of the cluster you want to advertise that you are available to receive traffic  shutdown properly cleans up the resources norbert uses and disconnects you from the cluster public class norbertclient public static void main string args clusterclient cc new zookeeperclusterclient norbert  localhost     cc awaiteconnectionuninterruptibly  cc getnodes  cc addlistener new myclusterlistener  cc marknodeavailable   cluster shutdown   there are currently two clusterclient implementations in norbert this code is instantiating the one that uses zookeeper  before using the clusterclient you must wait for it to finish connecting  at this point the cluster is usable and you can retrieve the list of cluster nodes  alternatively instead of step  you can register clusterlistener s with the cluster and they will be sent notifications when the state of the cluster changes  optional if you are a member of the cluster you want to advertise that you are available to receive traffic  shutdown properly cleans up the resources norbert uses and disconnects you from the cluster both the scala and java clusterclient s take three parameters  servicename the name of the service that runs on the cluster this name will be used as the name of a zookeeper znode and so should be valid for that use  zookeeperconnectstring the connection string passed to zookeeper  zookeepersessiontimeoutmillis the session timeout passed to zookeeper in milliseconds using norbert for client and server communication  in addition to the cluster management norbert provides an api for building cluster aware client and server applications norbert s client and server library uses message passing semantics and specifically protocol buffers to encode those messages to use norbert s client and server library you will need to define the protocol buffers you will use as requests and the associated protocol buffers that will be received as responses to those requests norbert uses a software load balancer mechanism to route a request from a client to a server both partitioned and unpartitioned clusters are supported if you are building a service which will use an unpartitioned cluster you must provide your networkclient instance with a loadbalancerfactory the loadbalancerfactory is used to create loadbalancer instance that will be used to route requests a round robin load balancer factory is provided if you are building a partitioned cluster then you will want to use the partitionednetworkclient and a partitionedloadbalancerfactory these are generic classes that have a partitionedid type parameter partitionedid is the type of the id that you use to partition your

859318, iphone app video mirroring for ios   be like steve  i wrote the original code so our local iphone developer s meetup could show off our apps to each other since then it s been used by hundreds of developers it s invaluable for group demos trade shows client meetings investor pitches and so on sadly ios   completely broke the old code so a rewrite was necessary happily ios  makes previously difficult things fairly easy bonus this code is now entirely safe for the app store zero private apis are used you do have the option to use one as you ll see below but it s turned off by default what s new  like before this is a fire and forget solution to mirroring the display of your ios device iphone ipod touch ipad on an external display the new version uses public apis so it can be used in apps published on the app store it supports detecting cabling plugging and unplugging the display  orientation changes and even offers a tv safe mode for displaying your app on an older analog video device you probably don t even know what that is because you re a young whippersnapper who grew up with lcd flatscreen tvs whereas i am testing this code on my old beloved apple and color display and thus find the tv safe mode handy under the hood new in this release is the tvoutmanager singleton class in the previous release i d made the tvout manager code as a category on uiapplication thinking that would make it easier to use and simpler to understand based on the emails i got i think it was definitely simple to use although not really simpler to understand so now tvoutmanager is its own class it s a singleton so you simply invoke commands on the shared instance for example here s how you start showing video tvoutmanager sharedinstance starttvout stopping is just as easy tvoutmanager sharedinstance stoptvout while the cable is connected changes to the device orientation are tracked and the mirrored output is rotated with a little animation effect compatibility note  connections and re connections  while the tv output is running if the video output cable is disconnected the class will catch a notification and stop sending video to the external window likewise if a video output cable is connected the class will catch that notification and automatically start showing the video note that you can use either the vga output cable composite video out cable or the component video output cable i have tested all three cables on both ipads and an iphone  and found that all cables work on all devices i m not sure about iphone gs and older devices though those devices may not support the vga cable although they certainly do support the composite and component cables app store safe  unlike the previous version this class uses app store safe methods you can ship apps that use this code we are using an apple approvied safe and friendly method of collecting bitmaps of all visible windows and then drawing that bitmap on the external screen which is also displayed using apple approved non private apis the previous version used the mptvoutwindow class which seems have to disappeared from ios   and uigetscreenimage to copy the image of the screen mptvoutwindow has always been forbidden but for a brief time apple allowed apps using uigetscreenimage onto the store from december of  until july  however with the release of ios   apple stuck the private designation on it again and apps are once again being rejected for it apple s terrible communciation with developers generally means that developers learn this by submitting an app and getting rejected so here i ve made use of uigetscreenimage an option why would you ever use it for one thing in my testing it s quicker than the non private methods it also captures the entire screen display including the status bar which is handy for our particular use uigetscreenimage also captures the output of eaglviews which the apple approved method does not although apple does have yet another method for getting that opengl support  there was widespread belief that the pervious version wouldn t work with opengl that mistaken belief came from me i didn t realize that uigetscreenimage would capture the contents of an opengl view in fact it does and it works great debugging with the video out cable attached  obviously you can t debug an app in xcode without having the device connected via usb likewise you can t view the video output without having the vga cable attached so debugging was basically impossible thankfully the latest simulator includes an option to show an external display but the simulator can t start and stop this external display while the app is running so it can t be used to debug notifications like uiscreendidconnectnotification reading some ancient forum posts about ipod dock issues i found a reference to the kensington k  in  car charger which is a usb cable that includes a full pass through dock connector intended for an fm tuner i guessed that they d have wired all of the pins and it would allow me to plug a second dock cable into the first these are no longer manufactured but a few online stores still had stock i ended up buying one from a seller on ebay it turned out to work perfectly i plugged the kensington cable into my mac and the rca video out or vga cable into the kensington cable and was able to debug away i highly recommend this setup if you need to debug while watching the display on the big screen improvements needed  currently device rotation is correctly tracked for the portrait and landscape left initial starting positions you can turn the device  degrees to the left or right and the view on the external monitor will rotate to match there s even a nice animated rotation of the screen contents on the external video window however portraitupsidedown is not handled and it s possible to confuse it this would be easily fixable if we knew what the previous orientation was but since the uideviceorientationdidchangenotification doesn t pass in the previous orientation or even the new orientation you have to get it from uidevice the code is essentially making a guess about how it should turn the mirrored view this guess happens to work fine for all starting positions and turns i usually care about i e portrait and landscape left and  turns from these if you need more a possible solution is to track the device orientation at init and across the lifetime of the object and compute the proper rotation of the view at each device orientation change notification i didn t need it so i didn t do it but if someone can contribute it that would be great mirror other apps  adam curry asked via email if it would be possible to run this in the background in ios   and magically mirror any app running on the device i tried it but it didn t work seems like the external monitor support switches to whatever app is in the foreground this is consistent with other apps that play video i e the ipod app streamtome etc so i m guessing this is just not possible without digging deeper into private apis get the code  tvoutmanager class reference  sharedinstance creates a singleton instance if it doesn t already exist and returns it starttvout creates a window on the second screen at the highest resolution it supports and starts a timer at the frames per second rate defined in the class file to copy the screen contents to the window if no screen is attached starttvout will simply report a failure to the console stoptvout stops the periodic video mirror timer or thread and releases the offscreen window tvsafemode when tvsafemode is yes the class will scale down the output size by   so that the entire picture can fit within the visible scan area of an analog tv if you don t know what an analog tv is don t worry you ll probably never see one kusebackgroundthread by default the class will use an nstimer to periodically copy the screen display if you re doing something that blocks the runloop a background thread may work better for you simply change the define to yes and the class will spawn a thread to periodically copy the screen define useuigetscreenimage set to no to use the app store and simulator safe method of capturing the screen set to yes to get the highest framerate

346619, refraction  refraction is a rack middleware replacement for modrewrite it can rewrite urls before they are processed by your web application and can redirect using  and  status codes refraction is thread safe so it doesn t need to be guarded by rack lock the best thing about refraction is that rewrite rules are written in plain old ruby code not some funky web server config syntax that means you can use ruby regular expressions case statements conditionals and whatever else you feel like for example refraction configure do and req and if req env httpuseragent and feedburner and feedvalidator and req host and pivotallabs com and case req path when r and talks and blabs and blog atom and rss req found feedburner and   when r and users and chris and edward and blog atom and rss req found feedburner and   end else case req host when tweed pivotallabs com when and w and pivotallabs com and passthrough with no change else wildcard domains e g pivotalabs com req permanent host pivotallabs com end end notice the use of regular expressions the   etc pseudo variables and string interpolation this is an easy way to match url patterns and assemble the new url based on what was matched refraction can be installed in a rails application as a plugin script and plugin install git and and github com and pivotal and refraction git it can also be used as a gem gem install refraction in environments and production rb  add refraction at or near the top of your middleware stack config middleware insertbefore rack lock refraction you may want to occasionally turn on refraction in the development environment for testing purposes but if your rules redirect to other servers that can be a problem put your rules in config and initializers and refractionrules rb see example above the file name doesn t actually matter but convention is useful if your application is serving multiple virtual hosts it s probably easiest to configure your web server to handle a wildcard server name and let refraction handle managing the virtual hosts for example in nginx that is done with a servername  directive set up your rewrite and redirection rules during your app initialization using refraction configure the configure method takes a block which is run for every request to process the rules the block is passed a requestcontext object that contains information about the request url and environment the request object also has a small api for effecting rewrites and redirects important note don t do a return from within the configuration block that would be bad meaning your entire application would break that s just how blocks work in ruby the set method takes an options hash that sets pieces of the rewritten url or redirect location scheme usually http or https host the server name port the server port usually not needed as the scheme implies a default value path the path of the url query added at the end of the url after a question mark any url components not explicitly set remain unchanged from the original request url you can use set before calls to rewrite  permanent  or found to set common values subsequent methods will merge their component values into values from set the rewrite method modifies the request url and relevant pieces of the environment when refraction rule processing results in a rewrite  the request is passed on down the rack stack to the app or the next middleware component rewrite can take a single argument either an options hash that uses the same options as the set method or a string that sets all components of the url the permanent method tells refraction to return a response with a  moved permanently status and sets the url for the location header like rewrite it can take either a string or hash argument to set the url or some of its components the found method tells refraction to return a response with a  found status and sets the url for the location header like rewrite it can take either a string or hash argument to set the url or some of its components use respond to return an arbitrary response to the request this is useful for responding with the contents of a static file for example req respond  content type text and html  file read maintenancepath the args are largely the same as the contents of a standard rack response array with the exceptions that you don t need to wrap the content in an array and the content length header is generated so it should not be supplied the request object provides the following components of the url for matching requests scheme  host  port  path  and query it also provides a full environment hash as the env attribute for example req env httpuseragent can be used to access the request s user agent property josh susser maintainer sam pierson wai lun mang brian morearty copyright c   pivotal labs this software is licensed under the mit license

45492, welcome to the selenium on rails readme exciting isn t it selenium on rails provides an easy way to test rails application with this plugin does four things  the selenium core files don t have to pollute tt and public and tt  no need to create suite files they are generated on the fly one suite per directory in tt and test and selenium and tt suites can be nested  instead of writing the test cases in html you can use a number of better formats see tt formats and tt  loading of fixtures and wiping of session tt and selenium and setup and tt rails periodically changes the way that it renders pages which unfortunately breaks backwards versions of selenium on rails therefore there are different installation locations depending on your version of rails rails   and up rails   before rails   the latest release is always kept on github at git clone git and and github com and paytonrules and selenium on rails git to install  install selenium on rails script and plugin install url  if you re on windows gem install win open  if the redcloth gem is available the selenese test cases can use it for better markup  run the rakefile in the plugin s directory to run the tests in order to see that everything works if redcloth isn t installed a few tests will fail since they assume redcloth is installed  create a test case script and generate selenium testname  start the server script and server e test  point your browser to localhost  and selenium  if everything works as expected you should see the selenium test runner the north east frame contains all your test cases just one for now  and the north frame contains your test case the test cases can be written in a number of formats which one you choose is a matter of taste you can generate your test files by running script and generate selenium or by creating them manually in your and test and selenium directory rselenese lets you write your tests in ruby this is my favorite format setup fixtures all open and asserttitle home a z each and c and open controller user  action create  name c see seleniumonrails testbuilder for available commands important note rselenese generates the html tables for selenium behind the scenes when the page is loaded once that means code like this   each do and index and do something will only be executed when the test is loaded not when the test is run this is a common error and leads to tests that work the first time and fail the second time selenese is the dumbest format in a good way you just write your commands delimited by and characters and open and and selenium and setup and and open and and and and goback and if you don t want to write selenese tests by hand you can use seleniumide which has support for selenese you can write your tests in html and rhtml but that s mostly useful if you have existing tests you want to reuse if you have some common actions you want to do in several test cases you can put them in a separate partial test case and include them in your other test cases this is highly recommended just as small functions would be recommended in structured programming a partial test case is just like a normal test case besides that its filename has to start with  login rsel open and login type name  name type password  password click submit  wait true to include a partial test case in a rselenese test case includepartial login  name jane doe  password jane doe reverse in a selenese test case and includepartial and login and name john doe and password eod nhoj and and in a rhtml test case render partial login  locals name joe schmo  password joe schmo reverse there are a number of settings available you make them by renaming selenium yml example to selenium yml and placing it in your rails app s config file make your changes in that file per default this plugin is only available in test environment you can change this by setting environments such as selenium yml environments development if you don t want to use the bundled selenium core version you can set seleniumpath to the directory where selenium core is stored config yml seleniumpath c selenium you can run all your selenium tests as a rake task if you re using a continuous builder this is a great way to integrate selenium into your build process first if you re on windows you have to make sure win open is installed then you have to configure which browsers you want to run like this config yml browsers firefox c program files mozilla firefox firefox exe ie c program files internet explorer iexplore exe now you re all set first start a server script and server e test then run the tests rake test acceptance now it should work otherwise let me know if you want to store the results from a test acceptance you just need to set in which directory they should be stored config yml resultdir c result so when you run rake test acceptance the tables with the results will be stored as html files in that directory selenium has support for userextension js which is a way to extend the functionality of selenium core selenium on rails now provides the means for you to extend it s functionality to match to get you started we ve included the example files lib and test builder user accessors rb example and lib and test builder user actions rb example that replicate the sample extensions in selenium core s user extensions js sample to get these examples running simply remove the example and sample extensions from the files and restart your server standalone mode more work is needed on test acceptance on windows to be able to start the server when needed documentation update contributing is simple fork this repo make your changes then issue a pull request important i will not take forks that do not have associated unit tests there must be tests and they must pass so i can bring the changes in jonas bengston original creator gordon mccreight a neat script that lists any unsupported methods

596888, tragedy   trunk by paul bohm enki bbq io and enkido on twitter a high level cassandra object abstraction for python tragedy currently only works with the latest cassandra trunk checkouts   this code is already used in production but still a moving target and expected to have bugs in tragedy you build your data model from models and indexes an abstract model specifies the kind data that can be stored in a model instance we also call a model instance a row since specific model instances are uniquely identified by their unique rowkey knowing the model and rowkey is all you need to store and retrieve data from cassandra the attributes of the model correspond to the columns of a row each column has a field type like stringfield or integerfield the rowkey decides which specific row and model instance the user is referring to and on which physical machine the data is stored if you lose a rowkey you can never store or retrieve that data again any unicode string can be used as rowkey as long as it is unique among all rows of a model if there s no naturally unique identifier for the data in a row you can ask tragedy to generate a uuid rowkey for you an index is a special kind of model with an unlimited number of columns that all have the same field type usually foreignkey indexes are used to map from one rowkey e g an username  to an ordered list of many others e g a list of blogposts the index is accessed with a rowkey and doesn t store any data except for the ordered list of rowkeys to other models since distributed datastores like cassandra don t support queries other than retrieving models by rowkey you have to create your indexes when you write your data by carefully tying models and indexes together you can build complex but efficient applications that can run on large computing clusters here s a simple example let s define and store a tweet for a twitter like application class tweet model uuid rowkey autogenerate true generate a uuid for us message stringfield author foreignkey foreignclass user mandatory true tweet is a model specification if we instantiate tweet we get a specific tweet that we can write to the database newtweet tweet message twittering from tragedy  author merlin newtweet save tweet instances are referred to and accessed by a rowkey tweet s rowkey is named uuid and its value is randomly autogenerated on the first save objects can only be retrieved from the datastore if their rowkey is known since tweet s rowkey is random we ll lose the tweet if we don t keep a reference somehow one way to do this is to store the rowkey in an index let s create an index of all tweets a specific user posts class tweetssent index byusername rowkey targetmodel foreignkey foreignclass tweet comparewith timeuuidtype merlinindex tweetssent byusername merlin merlinindex append newtweet merlinindex save tweetssent is an abstract index over tweets sorted by cassandra s timeuuidtype merlinindex is a specifc tweetssent index for user merlin  as specified by the given rowkey during instantiation items can be added to an index using the append method and changes to them saved using the save method just as with models we can only retrieve indexes whose rowkey we know if we do we can use load to load the index from the database tweetsbyuser tweetssent byusername merlin load print tweetsbyuser the main difference between indexes and models is that indexes keep track of an unlimited amount of ordered data of the same kind normally foreignkeys  whereas a model keeps track of a limited number of data that can be any mixture of types indexes are most often used to to help us find data whose rowkey we ve forgotten models can refer to indexes using foreignkeys and indexes can refer to both models and less often other indexes the call above gives us a list of tweets previously posted by user merlin with their rowkeys correctly set however since the index only contains references the actual tweet data hasn t been loaded yet at this point if we tried to work with those tweets we d see only empty tweets tweetssent merlin o sat jun      tweet ecbfdcf to actually load the tweets we need to resolve them retrieve them using their rowkeys luckily indexes have the resolve helper to make this easy tweetsbyuser resolve print tweetsbyuser tweet ecbfdcf message tweeting from tragedy  author user bbfdddce behind the scenes index resolve almost works like calling model load on all tweets in the list it s more efficient though since this combines all required queries into one multiquery for faster processing now we ve seen how to create tweets store them and find them again if you want to see how you can distribute them to followers scroll down for a full example of a twitter like application that s about it for the basics there s more stuff tragedy can do for you like automatic validation that tragedy and cassandra agree on the data model and the following example shows of some of them

1094909, in short with this library all your javascript is also rdf there are no special types or classes each variable and value is also an rdf node list or graph all values are both the standard javascript values you expect no extension or suchlike  and are the rdf types you expect this library doesn t inspect objects and then generate rdf rather each value is rdf and javascript here s a complicated yet simple example to illustrate this is just a standard object in js var me a foaf person  and and a string a curie and a full iri name nathan  and and a string and an rdf plain literal age new date getfullyear  and and a number and a typed literal with the type xsd integer holdsaccount and and an object with a blanknode reference for the id label nathan s twitter account l en  and and a string and a literal with a language accountname webr  and and noticed that you don t need the prefixes yet knows bob and and works with variables too of course nick webr  nath and and an array also a list of values like in turtle and n ref me and and still an object but also has a id now it s subject is set if we now call me n we ll get the following output foaf name nathan foaf age  foaf holdsaccount rdfs label nathan s twitter account en foaf accountname webr foaf nick webr  nath it s just that simple your javascript is your rdf it s just plain old javascript if me age  return true and and it s all native values just use like normal this library requires ecmascript  v specifically it makes heavy usage of object defineproperties the short version is that chrome  and  ff webkit safari and ie all support this script and on the server side node js rhino and besen are all fine objects and values are not modified in the usual manner and they are not converted in to different types rather this library automagically redefines the property descriptors on objects to allow each value to be both a native javascript value and an rdf compatible value all values of type string number boolean and date are also rdf nodes and are fully aligned and compatible with the interfaces from the rdfa api all of the basic js types string number boolean and date are augmented with the following methods nodetype returns one of plainliteral typedliteral blanknode or iri true nodetype and and typedliteral    nodetype and and typedliteral new date nodetype and and typedliteral hello world nodetype and and plainliteral  b nodetype and and blanknode foaf name nodetype and and iri equals other returns boolean rdf type safe equality test hello hello l en and and true hello equals hello l en and and false tont returns string does what it says on the tin returns the n triples formatted value hello world tont and and hello world hello world l en tont and and hello world en  b tont and and  b tocanonical alias of tont  rdfa api compatibility method n returns string returns the value formatted for n and turtle true n and and true    n and and   hello world n and and hello world hello world l en n and and hello world en  b n and and  b foaf name n and and foaf name a string can represent any of the rdf node types plainliteral and language  typedliteral blanknode or iri in js string exposes the following methods in addition to the standard methods outlined above l returns this set the language of a plainliteral exposes the language attribute after calling language is non enumerable read only var s hello world l en s language and and en s nodetype and and plainliteral s tont and and hello world en tl returns this set the type of a typedliteral exposes the type attribute after calling type is non enumerable read only var s fb tl xsd hexbinary s nodetype and and typedliteral note this method also caters for the situations when you want a plainliteral to be an xsd string or an iri to be a plainliteral var h hello and and hello resolve returns string iri resolve a curie to a full iri note this is done automatically by n and tont methods remember all javascript values and types remain unchanged so it s entirely backwards compatible with all existing data and will not modify any js values hello world l en is still a string properties like language and type are non enumerable so they won t show up in for loops or when you json stringify the values you cannot implement this library in non v ecmascript by simply adding a language property to the string object that simply won t work js is fully aware of number types it knows when a number is an integer a double or a decimal gotcha do note that you need to add a space between the number and the method or wrap the number in braces   tont  since js expects any integer followed immediately by a period to be a decimal like   this only applies to hard coded in the source code numbers and not those in variables or returned from functions so generally isn t noticable in the same way that you don t normally write  tostring js uses arrays for both lists of objects in property object chains name nathan  nath and as rdf lists you can determine whether an array is a list or not by inspecting the boolean property list on any array to specify that an array is a list you simply call tolist on it list boolean boolean flag indicating whether an array is an rdf list tolist returns this specifies that an array is to be used as an rdf list sets the list property to true n returns string returns the value formatted for n and turtle  n and and      tolist n and and     note that there are no tont or nodetype methods or related arrays and lists are not rdf nodes in js each object is by default just an object with a single additional method exposed ref when you call this method the object is rdf enabled whereby it is set to denote the description of something identified by a blanknode or an iri the keys properties are mapped to rdf properties a id attribute is exposed on the object and four methods are also exposed n  tont  using and graphify it s all really simple tbh the properties on each object can either be obj foaf name a normal curie obj foaf name a more javascript friendly curie where the is swapped for a obj name a single property which maps up to a curie which maps to an iri each value can be a single value of any type covered  or an array of values which might be a list  or an object which can be named with an iri or a blanknode identifier and thus just like normal javascript or json you can make an object structure as simple or as complicated as you like objects can also have methods on them and these are stripped from any output so any existing object whether dumb or a full class with properties can be used they re just javascript objects with a id set on them non enumerable and read only  and where the properties are mapped to rdf properties so each object can be seen to describe one thing one subject the id is the subject to set the id all you do is call ref on the object if you pass in a curie or an iri as a param then that is set as the subject and id if you call ref with no argument then it is given a blanknode identifier as the id using is a bit more subtle you can throw in the names of ontologies which properties your using come from in order to provide an unambiguous mapping for instance var article description a dc  not dc  description  label an rdfs label ref me using dc  rdfs if you don t pass in any names then they are mapped up on a first hit first used basis this is covered more in the section about propertymap and curiemap there is no special syntax and variables and references are part of javascript so they just work which means you can do things like this article maker me me made article article maker knows bob and and the same as me knows article created new date a foaf document  primarytopicof article ref this graphify turtle because we referenced article by value then it ll be in the output graph too we could use article id instead then it won t be included you can also have x many objects with the same id then when you graphify them they all get smashed together as one which is nice as for migrating iris or renaming subjects that s as simple as calling ref newid on any object no complex rdf replace routines needed when objects are nested they are by default considered to be blanknodes however  you can of course call ref on them in place and thus describe things in context and name them there too so in this case the object in holdsaccount will be a blanknode var me name nathan  holdsaccount label nathan s twitter account l en  accountname webr  ref me but in this case it ll have it s own iri var me name nathan  holdsaccount label nathan s twitter account l en  accountname webr  ref twitter  and and here s where we named it ref me of course we can code this however we want to get the same results for example var me name nathan ref me var account accountname webr account label nathan s twitter account account label l en me holdsaccount account me holdsaccount foaf homepage twitter webr resolve me holdsaccount ref twitter or create structures just as complex as we like deep item     mebob x mary tolist  new date  bob tolist  something substr  l en  bob id me id tolist  foo bar and interact with our data however we want var somedata values  tolist  created new date ref results with math somedata result somedata values map sqrt reduce function pc return max pc and then call n results seq values     seq result   it s all very flexible as you can see as we just map reduced an rdf list and updated a graph in one line id string read only non enumerable blanknode or iri in a string the subject and id of this object n returns string returns the object as n and turtle tont returns string returns the object as ntriples graphify returns rdfgraph returns the structure as an rdfgraph of rdftriples as per the rdfa api core interfaces compat and and using arg arg argn returns this pass in string prefixes for ontologies to consider when mapping simple properties js curiemap is a simple object which maps prefixes to iris to add a curie mapping to get an iri for a prefix var iri js curiemap foaf setdefault iri to set the default prefix getprefix iri get the registered prefix for an iri returns null if no prefix is found shrink iri turn an iri in to a curie this method returns either a curie or the original iri if no prefix is found js propertymap is a simple object which makes the lib aware of properties in ontologies to add the properties for an ontology js propertymap foaf name  mbox  page  note the value must always be an array to get the properties for an ontology var properties js propertymap foaf ambiguities returns an array of ambiguous properties var gotchas js propertymap ambiguities a simple method which can accept any number of objects or an array of objects and will return back an rdfgraph iri deref callback a web aware function that will get the description of a subject from the web negotiating formats and return back a js object to work with print me name and and etc  obj save a web aware function that will put an updated description me friends push somebody new me save  full rdfa api integration from the other side so you can do graph describe subject and get back an object and suchlike probably much more all feedback bugs etc via issues here or well you can get all my details from my foaf profile using this lib if

98355, these are modularized rails application templates the templates can be used on their own but more powerful app generation is possible through the applego rb template modular structure uses git every module makes a separate commit guiding questions or options through the legos environment variable the simplest way to use the template is to just provide the url of applego rb to the rails app generator and answer the questions the options and modules can be passed in through the legos environment variable if this is set the generator won t ask whether it should use braid and which modules it should use listing all the available options and modules the basic module initializes the rails application in a git repository removes unnecessary files and directories sets up gitignore files and freezes edge rails the rspec module remove the test directory and installs the plugins necessary for rspec it also runs the rspec generator the jquery module removes the default javascript files and installes jquery jquery ui and the jquery form plugin the first two come with minified and full versions too the auth module adds the authlogic gem and generates a usersession model for it with an optional user model the name of the user model and the user identifier can be given in the usermodel and userident environment variables the locale module also checks for module specific localizations in locales and under the same path app lego was called from the misc module inserts miscellaneous files into the application these include a basic applicationcontroller rb  some helpers a basic layout with flashes taken care of and some initializers so far this is all feel free to fork the repository and send me pull requests if you find out something cool app lego is licensed under the mit license

860467, timeline is the most important concept in trident js most often you use a timeline to change one or more attributes of some object over a certain period of time here is a simple example span id span style color rgb  onmouseover rollovertimeline play onmouseout rollovertimeline playreverse some text and span script var rollovertimeline new timeline span style rollovertimeline addpropertiestointerpolate and and interpolate the foreground color between blue and red property color  from rgb   to rgb   interpolator new rgbpropertyinterpolator  and and interpolate the background color between white and light yellow property backgroundcolor  from rgb   to rgb   interpolator new rgbpropertyinterpolator  and and over the period of  seconds rollovertimeline duration  and script here a timeline is created to interpolate the color and backgroundcolor attributes of the span style object over a period of two seconds  milliseconds the timeline is play ed when the mouse is moved over the span element and playreverse ed when the mouse is moved out of the span element this implements a simple rollover effect that is reversed automatically when the mouse is moved quickly over and out of this element a timeline pulse is the point where the timeline wakes up and changes the values of all registered attributes the values are changed based on how much time has passed since the timeline has started playing there is no guarantee how many pulses the specific timeline will have or how much time will pass between each successive pair of pulses this depends on the current system load and the specific implementation of the runtime environment the three basic timeline concepts illustrated in this sample are a timeline is associated with an object a timeline interpolates values of object attributes the attributes are modified at timeline pulses a timeline goes through different timeline states the timelinestate enumerates all possible timeline states with the basic ones being idle for timelines that are not playing a timeline is idle when it s been created but not played or after it has finished playing playing forward for timelines that interpolate fields from start value to end value playing reverse for timelines that interpolate fields from end value to start value done for timelines that have finished playing a done timeline becomes idle after notifying all listeners see below when the timeline is created it is in the idle state an idle timeline can be configured by the application code even after it has finished playing the configuration includes adding properties to interpolate changing the initial delay and duration adding callbacks and changing the ease function to start playing a timeline use the code timeline play and code method at every pulse the timeline will interpolate all registered properties using the public setters  as well as notify all registered callbacks if the timeline is already playing it will continue playing from the same point some scenarios required playing the timeline in reverse in the hello world example we wanted to animate the span foreground from blue to red when the mouse moves over it this is done in the code onmouseover and code handler to provide consistent ui behavior we also want to animate the foreground color from red back to blue when the mouse is moved away from the span this is done by calling the code timeline playreverse and code in the code onmouseout and code handler span id span style color rgb  onmouseover rollovertimeline play onmouseout rollovertimeline playreverse some text and span script var rollovertimeline new timeline span style rollovertimeline addpropertiestointerpolate and and interpolate the foreground color between blue and red property color  from rgb   to rgb   interpolator new rgbpropertyinterpolator  and and interpolate the background color between white and light yellow property backgroundcolor  from rgb   to rgb   interpolator new rgbpropertyinterpolator  and and over the period of  seconds rollovertimeline duration  and script suppose the user moves the mouse over the element and then quickly moves it away you do not want to have the reverse play start from the end value full red color this will create a noticeable color flicker on the screen internally code playreverse and code detects that this timeline is already playing forward  and starts playing it in reverse from its current position while code play and code and code playreverse and code respect the current timeline position for already playing timelines some scenarios require restarting the timeline the code timeline replay and code and code timeline replayreverse and code can be used in these cases code example below shows the code replay and code api used to restart the rollover animation that interpolates the background color of a single grid rectangle from yellow to black color function snakerectangle this backgroundcolor rgb  this

require running timelines in loop pulsating the notification bar to indicate new messages or showing an indefinite progress while your application connects over a slow line are examples of looping timelines looping timelines are created and configured in exactly the same way as regular timelines and they can interpolate one or more attributes of the associated main timeline object the only difference is the way the looping timeline is played there are two code timeline and code methods to start playing a looping timeline code timeline playinfiniteloop repeatbehavior and code code timeline playloop count repeatbehavior and code the first method starts an infinite loop at least until the timeline is canceled the second method runs the timeline for the specified number of loops the code repeatbehavior and code specifies what happens when the looping timeline reaches the end of the loop each timeline loop changes the internal duration fraction which is a number between   and   while a regular timeline ends once the fraction reaches the value   a looping timeline continues the difference between the repeat behaviors is in the way the timeline fraction is computed in the loop mode the timeline fraction starts from   is interpolated to   and once that value is reached it is reset back to   in the reverse mode the timeline fraction is interpolated during odd loops from   to   and is interpolated during even loops from   down to   as an example the loop mode can be used for circular indefinite progress indication where the matching lead angle is interpolated between  and  degrees the reverse mode can be used for displaying indefinite linear progress indication that oscillates between the left and right markers a timeline can be put in the suspended state by calling the code timeline suspend and code method a suspended timeline can be resumed with the code timeline resume and code method in some cases you will want to stop a running timeline there are three different apis that you can use each with its own semantics code timeline abort and code the timeline transitions to the idle state no application callbacks or field interpolations are done code timeline end and code the timeline transitions to the done state with the timeline position set to   or   based on the direction of the timeline after application callbacks and field interpolations are done on the done state the timeline transitions to the idle state application callbacks and field interpolations are done on this state as well code timeline cancel and code the timeline transitions to the cancelled state preserving its current timeline position after application callbacks and field interpolations are done on the cancelled state the timeline transitions to the idle state application callbacks and field interpolations are done on this state as well in addition there is a method to indicate that a looping timeline should stop once it reaches the end of the loop for example suppose that you have a pulsating animation of a notification bar to indicate unread messages once the message is read this animation is canceled in the application code however immediate cancellation of the pulsating animation may result in jarring visuals especially if it is done at the peak of the pulsation cycle calling code timeline cancelatcyclebreak and code method will indicate that the looping animation should stop once it reaches the end of the loop simple application scenarios create timelines configure them with attributes to interpolate and then play them however a more complicated application logic may require tracking the state changes of the timeline the code timeline addeventlistener and code api allows registering the following listener types code addeventlistener onstatechange  function timeline oldstate newstate durationfraction timelineposition and code this listener will be called whenever the timeline state is changed for example calling code timeline suspend and code will notify all the registered listeners that the timeline has changed its state from playing to suspended code addeventlistener onpulse  function timeline durationfraction timelineposition and code this listener will be called on every timeline pulse by default a trident js timeline runs for  milliseconds to change the default timeline duration change the code duration and code attribute setting the required duration in milliseconds at runtime the timeline interpolates all registered properties and notifies all registered listeners note that while the number of timeline pulses is directly proportional to the timeline duration the actual number of pulses as well as the intervals between each successive pair of pulses depends on the current load of the system and the runtime environment as such the application code must not make any assumptions about when the timeline pulses will happen and how many pulses will happen throughout the duration of the timeline the code timeline initialdelay and code attribute specifies the number of milliseconds the timeline should wait after the application code to code play and code before starting firing the timeline pulses for a timeline with no initial delay the following lifecycle events are fired idle ready immediately after call to code timeline play and code ready playing forward immediately afterwards for a timeline with non zero delay the following events are fired idle ready immediately after call to code timeline play and code ready playing forward after the specified initial delay has passed each timeline pulse has two associated fractional values duration fraction and timeline position duration fraction is a number between   and   that indicates the absolute percentage of the full timeline duration that has passed for example in a timeline that lasts  ms a timeline pulse happening  ms after the timeline has begun has the associated duration fraction of   however some application scenarios require non linear rate of change for recreating realistic animations of the real physical world for example if your application timeline is interpolating the code y and code location of a falling ball strict linear interpolation will result in overly artificial movement when objects in the real world move they don t move at constant speed for example a car starts from zero velocity accelerates to a constant speed maintains it throughout the main part of the movement and then decelerates to zero velocity as it reaches its final location the timeline position is a fractional number between   and   that indicates how far the timeline has progressed based on the current ease function the ease function takes the linearly increasing duration fraction and translates it to the matching timeline position the code timeline ease and code attribute can be modified to specify a custom ease function on the timeline it should be have a code map and code function that gets a duration fraction as a float and returns the matching timeline position the core library provides a number ease functions to illustrate the difference between the different ease functions we will use the core code splineease and code ease function the following screenshot shows the mapping between duration fraction and timeline position under code splineease         and code here the timeline position has almost linear rate of change throughout the entire duration of the timeline with little acceleration in the beginning and little deceleration at the end here is the mapping between duration fraction and timeline position under code splineease         and code here the acceleration phase is longer and the rate of change between the acceleration and deceleration phases is higher as you can see you can simulate different physical processes using different factors of code splineease and code ease function application code can create custom implementation of the ease function as well interpolation of field values for fields registered for the specific timeline is done based on the timeline position and not duration fraction application callbacks registered with the code timeline addeventlistener and code method get both values on every timeline pulse or state change this provides the application logic with the information how much time has passed since the timeline has started as well as how far along the timeline is based on its ease method the sample hello world code shown above interpolates foreground and background colors of an html span between two colors what if you want to animate a specific color attribute from yellow to green and then to black one option is to create two timelines one to animate from yellow to green and another to animate from green to black since the second timeline needs to wait until the first one ends you will have to either use the timeline callbacks or create a sequential timeline scenario see later in the documentation however there is a simpler solution for interpolating the value of a specific attribute between more than two values key frames a key frame defines the value of the field at the particular timeline duration fraction not timeline position let s see an example the bluish highlighter moves from left to right fading in as it appears on the left edge and fading out as it disappears on the right edge there are two attributes that control the appearance of the highlighter xposition interpolated between the left x and the right x alpha starts at   goes to   at  of the timeline duration stays at   until the timeline reaches its  mark and then goes back to   here is the matching timeline definition note the goingthrough mapping progresstimeline addpropertiestointerpolate property xposition  from startx to endx interpolator new intpropertyinterpolator  property alpha  goingthrough                interpolator new floatpropertyinterpolator timeline scenario allows combining multiple timelines in a parallel sequential or custom order to create a timeline scenario use the following apis of the code timelinescenario and code class code addscenarioactor actor and code adds the specified actor timeline code adddependency actor waitfor and code specifies the dependencies between the actors timelines if there are no dependencies between the scenario actors calling code timelinescenario play and code will start playing all the scenario timelines at the same time respecting the individual settings such as initial delay duration etc the code timelinescenario adddependency and code can be used to specify ordering between timelines the simplest example is a sequential scenario where the timelines are run one after another the first timeline starts the second one waits for it to complete and then starts and so on a more complex example is a rendezvous scenario here the timelines are played in stages once all the timelines in stage n have completed the timelines in stage n and  start playing in parallel finally you can also create a completely custom graph of dependencies just make sure that you don t have any loops for example a loop of size  would have timeline a depending on timeline b and timeline b depending on timeline a such a scenario will never complete

document matrix is constructed for the documents in the query result and decomposed using singular value decomposition the document vectors are then reconstructed based on a reduced rank parameter to get rid of noise these reconstructed document vectors are clustered by comparing the cosine similarity distance of each individual document to the first n principal components decomposition is performed using the distributedlanczossolver from apache mahout on a hadoop cluster after decomposition of the term document matrix the reduced rank document vectors are clusters using k means clustering also from apache mahout or a local hierarchical clustering method the number of clusters must be supplied if using the kmeans algorithm a dendrogram is produced as output from the hierarchical development goals include determining the optimal number of clusters optimizing the reduced rank etc lsasolr depends on the   development version of solr and the   development version of clojure in order to build lsasolr you will need to build the appropriate versions of solr and clojure generate the maven artifacts and install them in your local maven repository then lein deps lein jar installing  due to some clojure classloader requirements you will need to install the lsasolr jar and its dependencies into the solr webapp and web inf and lib directory rather than using the

348037, ruby on sails sailing the waves of google with ruby  aka google wave provider implemented in ruby with a ruby on rails interface ruby on sails isn t really set up for sidespread setups or even sending to a friend you ll notice the rails and folder this is the rails app this isn t supposed to be run by itself in order for all the features to work you ll have to use the rackup file the main provider file xmppcomponent rb requires a file from the rails site so you ll have to update the paths if you move stuff around it s easiest to use sails when you already have a xmpp server that fedone can connect to to set up openfire follow these directions ginstall sails also attempts to sign deltas so you ll need to create certs for it to use it uses domain cert and domain key by default which is what is given to you if you follow google s instructions gcerts to create certs i have included their make cert sh utility in the sails repo the paths are setable in the yaml config you ll need a few gems to run sails and the provided webui so make sure that you have rubygems and ruby installed and run sudo gem install authlogic rails sqlite ruby hpricot you may want to consult gem list local for a list of already installed gems the sqlite ruby gem probably will want you to install developement headers and packages for sqlite on my ubuntu machine the dev package was called libsqlite dev finally you ll have to config the xmpp component ruby on sails will try reading sails conf a yaml file for configuration settings it has xmpp domain host port password and service name there plus a few other worthless things such as certificate paths make sure that you have openfire or some other xmpp server configed and running run the xmpp component like so rake provider start if it has some file reading error then it can t find the certs todo cleaner error message if it said the server denied the component ensure that you configged your xmpp server correctly and if you ve used fedone that it isn t running if anything else happened either it s good it didn t crash or it s bad gist the output and file a bug report the sails webui is built with ruby on rails the ruby on sails name is also stolen from rails name the live update system is built in rackup and has only been tested with thin first things first you need a db to store user accounts and eventually waves in cd to rails and and run rake db migrate if anything other than success occurs scroll down to the contact me section the easiest way to run the site in a dev environment is by running this from the main sails folder not rails and rake thin start which should start up a cute little http server ready for browsing on port  visit the site you ll have to register an account your db is going to be a fresh creation not a copy of the live one from my site once that s set up and running drb error free play around in the webui for a bit p when you are done you can stop the thin server with either rake thin stop or simply thin stop contributing   fork it  create a branch  commit your changes  push to the branch  send me a link to your branch see the contact me section  enjoy a refreshing glass of water and wait contact me  i idle in googlewave on freenode  and  and also on my private network at irc eighthbit net you can send me github messages or email me at me github danopia net i also may read any waves sent to me my username is ddanopia on the public preview danopia on the sandbox

746164, disclaimer this is alpha quality code and the api is not yet stable introduction  schemaless is a python module that implements the pattern described by bret taylor in his post are a couple of other python modules out there that do this already here s how schemaless is different only mysql is supported that said i d love to add sqlite support in the future sharding isn t yet supported should be pretty straightforward to implement though there s an optional orm which isn t really relational implemented as schemaless orm the orm really is optional and the interface described by friendfeed is all usable and decoupled from the session and object stuff the orm is designed to be mostly declarative and easy to use that means that you can say i have have a document type user  and please can i have an index on userid  and i d also like an index on firstname lastname please the orm will then create the necessary index tables and automatically update them when you add new users it will also know how to pick the most specific index given an arbitrary query basic usage  the code exported under the schemaless module exactly mimics the behavior and interface described by friendfeed consider the following mysql database schema create table entities addedid int not null autoincrement primary key id binary  not null updated timestamp not null default currenttimestamp body mediumblob unique key id  key updated engine innodb create table indexuserid entityid binary  not null unique userid char  not null primary key userid entityid engine innodb create table indexusername entityid binary  not null unique firstname varchar  not null lastname varchar  not null primary key firstname lastname entityid engine innodb create table indexfoo entityid binary  not null unique bar integer not null primary key bar entityid engine innodb the meaning of all of these tables should be clear to you if you ve read bret s blog post the following code is a simple example of the interface that schemaless provides import schemaless from schemaless import c ds schemaless datastore mysqlshards localhost   user foo  password foo  database foo declare which indexes are available user ds defineindex indexuserid  userid username ds defineindex indexusername  firstname  lastname foo ds defineindex indexfoo  bar automatically knows that index entries should be created in indexuserid and indexusername based on the keys in the row given row ds put firstname evan  lastname klitzke  userid schemaless guid query based on userid using the index defined by indexuserid print user query c userid row userid query based on first and last name using the index defined by indexusername print username query c firstname evan  c lastname klitzke orm layer  there s an optional orm layer exported via the module schemaless orm when you use the orm layer you can use indexes declaratively and schemaless can automatically pick the correct index to use based on your query the orm layer also knows how to do queries when a full index isn t available e g if you add a query restriction that isn t fully covered by an index the best way to get a feel for the orm is to look at the example in examples and blog and main py this is the implementation of a trivial blog application that uses schemaless and tornado it s only about a hundred lines of code and shows a few different working parts interacting together adding indexes  there s a class called indexupdater exported by the schemaless module that provides a basic template for batches that add and update and prune indexes it s probably easiest to understand how it works if you look at the source code for it which provides an example of a batch that adds a new index in the module documentation look under schemaless and batch py

1021047, a very simplistic command line to do and note list manager in ruby why another to do list manager i spend a lot of time in the terminal and i haven t liked any of the current options how does dooby works  dooby can handle one list per directory for instance i use one to do list per project that way i don t have all the items in one place so i can get focused in just one set of items in one context dooby uses some special characters to visually help us to differentiate between things and let us search items very easily the ones that you might recognize are and  i stole the idea from twitter but of course they don t behave as in twitter the sign is not an username but a character to tag a person that s all nothing else so far peter john jim contexts states of mind mood places etc today tomorrow urgent work home thinking sad item sets for objectives that takes more than one task to achieve fixcomputer shoppinglist subproject today as you can see we can use as if it were  i mean as a context this is because most of these tags are meaningless to dooby she yes she s a woman isn t aware of them dooby is aware only of some of them tomorrow all the items tagged with today and urgent will be shown in a special section every time you list your to dos and notes it will be converted into tomorrow s date and marked with the tag today at the next day say today is november   and you create an item like this i need to fix the bug tomorrow dooby will save it as i need to fix the bug nov and  and  now say today is november   dooby will show it like this i need to fix the bug today of course it d be shown in the today section the item tagged as doing will be the current item and some commands will affect it or use it without specifying an item id basic usage  note all the commands have a shortcut which is the first or two first letters of it first of all create an alias if you want to save some keystrokes alias d dooby d init this creates a dooby and list yml file in the current directory dooby will save all the items in it d add fix the email error in website check this out with peter today d a learn to use the aliases of the commands d a pair with jim on the tickets module try the following commands once you create the items above d list peter d l today d l today d l website you can use the tab key to autocomplete tags t tab oday showing items containing today  fix the email error in website check this out with peter today cfbf need to go to the doctor hendrix today doctor showing items containing doctor cfbf need to go to the doctor today showing items containing email  fix the email error in website check this out with peter today note dooby uses sha as item id hendrix website tickets dooby supports autocompletion of item ids in the delete  bulkdelete and the edit commands as well d edit item id b tab bf now press enter and tab again if you want the original text of the item item id bbf tab or up arrow to edit tab fix the email error in website check this out with peter today edit it and press enter and the item will be saved item id bbf tab or up arrow to edit fix the email error in website today d delete item id  tab ad note the sha of the item we edited previously has changed because it s based on the content item id cfbf cfbf deleted dooby won t ask you if you really really want to delete the item showing all items cff fix the email error in website today if you want to delete all the items containing an exact tag or set of tags or a tag starting with some text you can use bulk delete to do so this feature will delete only by tag not simple text actually if you enter simple text it will simply ignore it bulk delete supports auto completion too say you want to delete all the items containing hendrix and today d bulkdelete what do you want to bulk delete t tab oday h tab endrix what if you want to delete all the items containing a tag starting with ma like mac  manual  and macro  simple what do you want to bulk delete ma enter that s it d flush sure yes and no all the items were deleted d trash sure yes and no no more dooby here tt let s say we add a task we need to get done d a fix the bug in cart doing and that once we get the task done we want to commit the fix git add thefile d commit the commit message was fix the bug in cart you can check the help out using the h flag d t h d l h synopsis dooby list whattoshow options and description lists people tags projects or items default parameters whattoshow  whattoshow help h ruby versions  dooby works on the following rubies    rc ree      known bugs  in windows the text is shown with the color codes even installing the winconsole gem refactor list find method it must return a hash of items not the strings to show in terminal dooby done should tag the current item as done make it configurable through an external file get rid of special chars   when item is used as git commit message if item is tagged as doing check if there are others tagged with the same tag if so tag them with hold hide items tagged as hidden only show items not containing the specified word s special thanks  most of the the ideas to code dooby were based on the work of other programmers here s a list of all of them thanks all of you note on patches and pull requests  fork the project make your feature addition or bug fix add tests for it this is important so i don t break it in a future version unintentionally commit do not mess with rakefile version or history if you want to have your own version that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself i can ignore when i pull send me a pull request bonus points for topic branches copyright  copyright c  rafael magana see license for details
222572, crumble it s like breadcrumbs for your rails application it s a tiny combination of a helper and a simple configuration class to make breadcrumbs cool because they re not installation   rails   the gem is hosted on gemcutter so if you haven t already add it as a gem source then install the crumble gem recommended gem install crumble alternatively you can also install it as a rails plugin script and plugin install git and and github com and mattmatt and crumble git requires rails   note if you have configured rails to reload all plugins in development mode then putting your breadcrumbs configuration into an initializer won t work since the classes and therefore the breadcrumbs configuration will be unloaded after the request and not be reloaded before the next one this will cause the problem either disable it or let rails use the default which is to not reload plugins config reloadplugins true  rails  in gemfile add  gem crumble  require breadcrumb i wanted to have a rather simple api to configure breadcrumbs so i made one basically you configure your breadcrumbs in an initializers e g config and initializers and breadcrumbs rb like so breadcrumb configure do specify name link title and the url to link to crumb profile your profile  accounturl crumb root home  rooturl specify controller action and an array of the crumbs you specified above trail accounts show root profile trail home index root specify the delimiter for the crumbs delimitwith and you can hand over parameters to the url generator methods the parameters are expected to exist as instance variables in your controller and helper crumb blogcomment your profile  blogcommenturl blog comment if you need to fetch a nested object from an existing one you can do it with nested hashes nesting knowing now boundaries as long as a tree of objects conforming to them in this case user blog name exists crumb blog your blog  blogurl user blog name crumb blog your blog  blogurl user blog if you really need to only if you really really need to  you can specify a string to be eval d at runtime as parameter for the url method brace yourself it s not pretty crumb blog your blog  blogurl user blog you can also add url parameters derived from the parameters of the current request crumb search search  newsearchurl params q arrays of parameters work too crumb search search  newsearchurl params q country and nested parameters crumb search search  newsearchurl params search q if you want to make the link title content dynamic just use single quotes and rely on interpolation you just need to ensure the interpolated code exists in the context of your helpers crumb search search keywords params q  newsearchurl params q if you don t want to specify any url method at all just use current it ll just use all the parameters of the current action of course being aware that you can t have an url method called current to rely on but who would do that anyway crumb search search keywords params q  current internationalization usage for example if you want to localize your menu define a new breadcrumbs node in your yml file with all the keys for your elements config and locales and en yml breadcrumbs homepage homepage profile your profile profiledynamic hi name config and locales and es yml breadcrumbs homepage homepage profile tu perfil profiledynamic hola name then you can define the title of your crum as crumb profile nil accounturl crumble find your locale for the scope breadcrumbs crumb name if you want to make the in title content dynamic just use a hash with the same key as the in param and with a hash value that will be interpolate to user name in this case crumb profiledynamic name user name  accounturl you can base trails on conditions using unless and if both need to point to a method that exists in the context of the view trail home index root  unless loggedin trail home index youraccount  if loggedin alternatively you can specify a block that takes the controller as an argument trail home index youraccount  if lambda and controller and controller loggedin your trails can also relate to a bunch of actions just specify an array instead trail profiles show edit  profile to keep your breadcrumbs definition neat and tidy wrap them based on their context with a handy method called you guessed it context context user profile do trail home index root  unless loggedin trail home index youraccount  if loggedin dump your trails and crumbs in there and bask in the glory of an easier readable crumbs definition if you don t want to have the last crumb linked no problem at all we can do that too breadcrumb configure do dontlinklastcrumb yep that s it include that in your breadcrumbs definition and you re done then in your views just insert the following crumbs don t forget to include the helper in the affected controllers class applicationcontroller actioncontroller base helper breadcrumbs if your trails reference non existing crumbs the plugin will raise an error telling you where in your configuration the illegal reference was made if you think something s missing let me know at meyer paperplanes de  or even better send patches including tests

375017, sprite is a gem that helps generate css sprite images automagically it s aim is to support all web frameworks merb and rails and sinatra  and have extensible output generator by default it supports css and sass output via mixins sprite currently requires the rmagick gem to install it use gem install rmagick if you have any problems with the rmagick gem install imagemagick via macports first sudo port install libxml sudo port install imagemagick install the sprite gem from gemcutter gem install sprite if installed as a gem at your root project folder you can just run sprite without having to configure anything sprite will allow you to easily generate sprites based on a couple default folder settings we give you right off the bat for example given you have the following setup public and images and sprites and black icons and stop png go png back png forward png weather and sunny gif rainy gif cloudy gif running sprite with no configuration file will generate the following new files public and stylesheets and sprites css images and sprites and black icons png weather png any folders within public and images and sprites and will get compressed into a merged image file at the same location then sprites css will get generated in the stylesheets folder with all the class definitions for these files just add a link to sprites css into your html head and you re ready to go configuration of sprite is done via config and sprite yml it allows you to set sprite configuration options and fine tune exactly which sprites get generated where config section defines all the global properties for sprite generation such as how it generates the styles where it looks for images where it writes it output file to and what image file format it uses by default style defines how the style rules are outputted built in options are css  sass  and sassmixin defaults to css styleoutputpath defines the file path where your style settings get written defaults to stylesheets and sprites the file extension not needed as it will be set based on the style setting imageoutputpath defines the folder path where the combined sprite images files are written defaults to images and sprites and imagesourcepath defines the folder where source image files are read from defaults to images and publicpath defines the root folder where static assets live defaults to public and spritesclass defines the class name that gets added to all sprite stylesheet rules defaults to sprites defaultformat defines the default file image format of the generated files defaults to png defaultspacing defines the default pixel spacing between sprites defaults to  classseparator used to generated the class name by separating the image name and sprite name defaults to adddatestamps whether or not to add datestamps to the generated background image urls this will allow proper cache versioning defaults to true images section provides an array of configurations which define which image files are built and where they get their sprites from each image setup provides the following config options name name of image required sources defines a list of source image filenames to build the target image from required they are parsed by code dir glob and code align defines the composite gravity type horizontal or vertical defaults to vertical spacedby spacing in pixels between the combined images defaults to  format define what image file format gets created optional uses defaultformat setting if not set all image and style paths should be set relative to the public folder which is configurable via publicpath setting defines the base configuration options file paths etc default style etc config style css styleoutputpath stylesheets and sprites imageoutputpath images and sprites and imagesourcepath images and publicpath public and spritesclass sprites classseparator defaultformat png defaultspacing  defines what sprite collections get created images creates a public and images and sprites and bluestars png image with  sprites in it name bluestars format png align horizontal spacedby  sources icons and blue stars and small png icons and blue stars and medium png icons and blue stars and large png icons and blue stars and xlarge png creates a public and images and sprites and green stars jpg image with all the gif files contained within and images and icons and green stars and name greenstars format png align vertical spacedby  sources icons and green stars and gif by default it will use with style css and generate the file at public and stylesheets and sprites css sprites blue stars small background url and images and icons and blue stars and small png no repeat px px width px height px sprites blue stars medium background url and images and icons and blue stars and medium png no repeat px px width px height px sprites blue stars large background url and images and icons and blue stars and large png no repeat px px width px height px sprites blue stars xlarge background url and images and icons and blue stars and xlarge png no repeat px px width px height px we also support mixin syntax via style sassmixin if set it will generate a sass mixin which you can use in order to mix in these sprites anywhere within your sass stylesheets for this option set styleoutputpath to stylesheets and sass and sprites in order to generate the sass mixin file at stylesheets and sass and sprites sass import sass and mixins and sprites sass and and you can then use your sprite like this largebluestar and sprite blue stars  large mysmallbluestar and sprite blue stars  small additional style generators are very easy to add we have one for style sass and style sassext the sassext style is a work in progress as it s attempting to write the sprite data to yml and use a dynamic sass extension to provide the mixin eventually if it works this will be the default for sassmixin sprite is provided as a command line helper deep web framework integration is not implemented at this time however it shouldn t be needed just generate your sprites on your dev machine by running the command line check in the resulting sprite images and stylesheets to your source control and deploy you can also easily script it out via capistrano you could also run sprite on application start or just about anywhere let me know what limitations you run into since then it s been rebuilt with some reuse of the image generation code to be a general purpose ruby executable with hooks for merb and rails and sinatra released under the mit license

1073086, health js  network service for getting cpu of remote system and receiving cpu usage alerts tested on node js    and    this will only run on linux osx and bsd are not supported author brendon crawford mailto brendon last vc basic usage  to get help you can run node health js help health js serves  primary modes streaming mode and event mode streaming mode allows a client to connect and receive streaming cpu usage data event mode enables health js to notify a remote server when cpu usage hits a certain threshold both modes can be run simultaneously running in streaming mode  to run health js in streaming mode the command format is node health js listen ip port port cycle time number examples node health js listen     node health js listen     port  node health js listen     port  cycle time  explanation of options listen ip this is the ip address that the streaming server should listen on if this option is not provided the streaming server will not be enabled port port this is the port number that the streaming server should listen on the default is  cycle time number this is the amount of milliseconds that the server should wait before calculating a new cpu check lower numbers have a higher performance overhead the default is   seconds running in event mode  to run health js in event mode the command format is node health js remote host ip remote port port threshold cpu number cycle time number threshold cycles number resend wait number examples node health js remote host     remote port  threshold cpu  threshold cycles  resend wait  cycle time  explanation of options remote host ip this is the remote ip address to notify when cpu hits a certain threshold remote port port this is the port of the remote host to notify when cpu hits a certain threshold threshold cpu number this is the number that average cpu usage needs to hit to trigger an event notification to remote host the default for this is   cycle time number this is the amount of milliseconds that the server should wait before calculating a new cpu check lower numbers have a higher performance overhead the default is   seconds threshold cycles number this is the number of cpu checks that will be used to calculate cpu average the time interval of one single cpu check is determined by cycle time a lower number will yield more volatile results at a quicker pace a higher number will yield more precise results at a slower pace for example if cycle time is set to   and threshold cycles is set to  and threshold cpu is set to   this would mean that a notification would be sent if over a period of  seconds the average cpu usage was  the default for this is  resend wait number this is the amount of time in minutes that health js should wait before sending another notification to remote server the default for this is   hours running in event and streaming mode simultaneously  both modes can be used at the same time examples node health js listen     port  remote host     remote port  threshold cpu  threshold cycles  resend wait  cycle time  connecting with client to health js streaming service  a client can connect to the health js streaming service via tcp a client should connect via tcp to the listening port the default port is  and the default interface to listen on is     to listen on all interfaces specify     as the listening ip once connected the client may send one of two messages get cpu once this will grab one cpu update an exit get cpu loop this will indefinitely grab cpu updates until client disconnects here are some examples of connecting via common unix utilities get one single cpu status using netcat echo get cpu once and nc q  localhost  get infinite loop of cpu status using netcat echo get cpu loop and nc q  localhost  get infinite loop of cpu status using telnet telnet localhost  telnet get cpu loop the response from the streaming server will be a cpuusage string see below for more information on the cpuusage string the cpuusage string  the cpuusage string from health js will be  or more decimal floating point numbers separated by a space on a single line an example response might look like this           column  is the average percentage of cpu usage for all cores and processors in the system all columns after  represent the cpu usage of that particular processor and core so in the example above the breakdown would be system average   processor    processor    processor    processor    receving notifications from the health js event service  if cpu usage reaches a certain threshold health js will send an event notification to remote host if it is set the event notification will have the following format command and elapsedtime and cpuaverage and cpuusage example notification put cpu and  and   and           explanation of parameters command this will always be put cpu elapsedtime this will be the amount of time that cpu usage was calculated over to calculate cpuaverage cpuaverage this is the average cpu average load over the period of time defined by elapsedtime cpuusage for information on the cpuusage string see the cpuusage section above here are some examples of setting up notification recievers via common unix utilities receive events using netcat nc kl      receive events using python import socketserver class handler socketserver streamrequesthandler def handle self print self rfile readline strip server socketserver tcpserver        handler server serveforever security concerns  this service provides no means of authentication it should only be run on private interfaces and ips which are only exposed to your local trusted network it should never be run on a public facing ip or an ip on an un trusted network if you need to run this on an untrusted network or if you want an an authentication mechanism you should have it listen on host     and access it via an ssh tunnel if you don t know what any of this means you probably should not

with a few features this guide will walk you through each step as you create feature branches rc branches and complete a production release of the app let s get started first you ll need to make sure your system has git installed that you have a github account and that you ve added your local ssh key to your github account fork this repository on github and then follow the instructions to clone your new repo on your development machine you should now be in your cloned git tutorial repository let s see what branches you have git branch master right now there s just one branch master  and you re on it as denoted by the we want a branch called next where you ll develop the next release so let s create git branch next git branch master next now we ve got a next branch but we re still working in master switch to next git checkout next switched to branch next finally let s push the next branch to origin so other developers can use it git push origin next great now we can get down to business now that you re ready to develop it would probably be good to know what you re working on let s run the app to see what it does php movieplot php he s a fat goat wrangler with a lust for antiques she s a sadistic dentist with a penchant for melodrama they fight crime ok so it s a php script that generates amazingly profitable movie plot ideas take a moment now to browse through the code for movieplot php to see how it works it s a pretty straight forward script there are arrays for adjectives occupations and quirks which the script puts together mad libs style to get an action movie plot your bosses at the movie studio have  new features they want you to develop you can do these in any order and you ll want to use feature branches to keep your work organized you won t know until the end of this exercise which features will actually be included in the next release to create a feature branch first think of a name and then create it git checkout b randomness switched to a new branch randomness note we used git checkout b to both create the branch and start working in it do your work in movieplot php  and then commit it git commit a m implemented randomness change note the a option will commit all modified files once you re done working on a particular feature branch and you ve committed your changes you can start the next feature by branching off of next again git branch newbranch next when all your feature branches are done move on to the next step the execs have noticed that some plots come up more often than others they ve seen one too many buddy cop flicks and they want you to fix it the reason is that the script is using php s rand function when it should really be using the improved mtrand function instead for this task you need only replace rand with mtrand right now the choices for adjectives occupations and quirks are a little sparse for this task add at least  more choice to each array sometimes the script will generate a plot where both lead characters have the same quirk or occupation adjective talk about boring modify the script so that her quirk occupation and adjective is never the same as his oh no the studio execs have noticed a typo in the movie plot generator instead of grisly  the program has been creating girsly characters the screenwriters are threatening to go on strike so you d better fix this fast since we don t have time to wait for the next release for this fix we will create a hotfix branch git checkout b hotfix    master notice that we branched directly from master so we can deploy this fix to production go fix the typo in movieplot php  and then commit it git commit a m fixed typo now you need to merge that hotfix back into master and next  so it can be deployed to production and also included in future releases git checkout master git merge no ff hotfix    git tag a    git checkout next git merge no ff hotfix    now that we re done with that hotfix branch we can delete it git branch d hotfix    this fix needs to go live now so push your master branch back to origin git push origin master and push next so other developers get that backported fix git push origin next phew now the operations team can push the app into production good work your bosses have decided they are ready for a new release of the movie plot app they only want to include the randomness improvement and the duplication prevention features since they still need the studio execs to vet the content you added go ahead and merge the appropriate feature branches into next  and delete each feature branch once it s merged git checkout next git merge no ff randomness git branch d randomness git merge no ff dedupe git branch d dedupe note make sure you use the branch names you chose note we used the no ff option to prevent a fast forward merge this way git will preserve the history of the feature branch if you have conflicts you will need to edit movieplot php to resolve them use git add to add the file to the index and then commit now that next reflects a state of the app that is ready for acceptance testing we ll create a release candidate branch git checkout b rc    next test the application to make sure it is all working as expected if there are bugs fix them and commit the fix directly to rc    remember that only bugfixes should be committed to an rc branch our new version is ready to go live just merge the rc branch into master git checkout master git merge rc    at this point you can tag master with the new version number git tag a    then push the new release back to the origin server git push origin master if you made any fixes in the rc branch merge it back into next  then push git checkout next git merge rc    git push origin next lastly delete the rc branch since we re done with it git branch d rc    aside from having a top notch movie plot generator you should also now have a pretty good feel for how to work with git and this particular branching model

1146748, superclass adds class abstraction and inheritance to javascript something i think is sorely lacking natively to create a new class just initialize superclass and and require superclass var user new superclass you can pass an argument to superclass which will be the class user inherits from then call include to add instance methods user include init function id and and called on instantiation this id id name function return bar var u new user  alert u name and call extend to add class static methods user extend records  first function return this records  as in ruby callbacks are triggered when an object is included or extended var module extended function base console log was extended by  base user extend module superclass exposes an instances class with the class attribute unfortunately we need to use a underscore as class is a reserved keyword var u new user u class and and user the only other thing superclass includes is the proxy function which saves context this is useful whenever you re using something that changes the context like event handers jquery for example changes the context in event handlers to point to the target element the instance s context is wrapped by the proxy function making sure that any functions called are in the right context item include init function element this element jquery element this element click this proxy this click click function and and element was clicked superapp is a state machine that you can bind and trigger events from state machines are a great way of building ui s and by making sure your application s logic is neatly encapsulated in each state you ll reap the rewards in maintainability and future development often too little thought is given to the structure of javascript applications and you can end up with quite a mess superapp is a lightweight and flexible solution to that problem so to create a state we first need a global application object we ll call it app and and require superapp var app new superclass app extend state new superapp and then in a separate state file we can create a state called activity notice we re wrapping it in a anonymous function to keep variables from polluting the global namespace function var state app state add activity jquery now we need to add some events to our state machine state setup function and and state beforeenter function and and the different events you can bind to are load triggers on page load setup triggers when the state is first entered beforeenter afterenter beforeexit afterexit and lastly to change states we call the change function passing the name of the state we want to change to any additional arguments given will be sent to the beforeenter function app state change activity often it s useful to tie views into the application s state i e changes in state will cause changes in the ui superapp view js is here to help you do just that you can tie a state machine and view together by simply setting the view attribute on your state with a superapp view instance when instantiating superapp view you ll need to pass in an element which will be the one that wraps your view states you ll have to do that after the page loads otherwise the element won t exist and and require superapp view jquery function app state view new superapp view views and then we define our states in html and div all superapp view does is add and remove a css class called current when swapping out the states it doesn t show or hide them so we ll have to do that in css making sure the states that aren t current are hidden views not current display none important unfortunately that s fairly advanced css not supported by legacy browsers for better backwards compatibility we could style it slightly differently views div display none views div current display block now we have to tell superapp that the specific states have a view element associated with them we can do this by setting the hasview attribute to true var state app state add activity state hasview true now whenever the state changes the relevant parts of the ui will be hidden and shown don t forget to set a default state when the page loads jquery function app state change dashboard one neat piece of functionality in superapp view is automatically populating element variables what i mean by that is that if you have an element inside a state with a data name attribute a variable named after that attribute s value will be available on the state pointing to that jquery element instance so if we have a div with a data name inside our state like so and div and div we can access the firstname variable inside the state which will point to a jquery instance of the element state beforeenter function this firstname text and and donna moss this is a really useful feature and cuts down on a lot of jquery selectors let s create a class and and require supermodel var asset supermodel setup asset asset attributes name  size asset include getext function return this name substr this name lastindexof now we can play around with asset instances var asset new asset asset name paul png asset size  asset save asset count and and  asset exists asset id and and true asset getext and and png asset destroy when an model is changed it s callback is triggered you can bind to callbacks like this asset beforesave function record and and available callbacks are beforesave aftersave beforecreate aftercreate beforeupdate afterupdate beforedestroy afterdestroy you can also achieve a basic form of validation by throwing an exception in a before callback we can use a callback to set a timestamp on a model when it s saved supermodel timestamp extended function base base attributes push createdat base attributes push updatedat base on beforesave  function item var date new date toisostring if item createdat item createdat date if item updatedat item updatedat date  asset extend supermodel timestamp we re adding two new attributes createdat and updatedat then before the record is saved we re setting those two columns to the current time supermodel has basic relationship support between models namely hasmany and belongsto and and require supermodel relation asset belongsto user user hasmany assets and and then we can do user first getassets var asset asset first asset getuser asset setuser user first we can use html s localstorage feature to automatically save any records we create between page reloads and and require supermodel marshal asset extend supermodel marshal when the page closes all the asset records will be serialized and stored in the browser s local storage when the page loads those records will be deserialized and created in memory again so we ve got states views and models now we just need to tie them all together you can use superconnect to bind a model and view together updating the view whenever the model changes for example let s create a list of assets first the html markup notice the dollar templating syntax and div and now when the page loads let s connect that  assets div to the asset model and and require superconnect jquery function assets connect asset for var i  i  i and and asset create name big ben and i size   you should see a list of asset names in the page if an asset record is update or destroyed the list will be changed to reflect that binding is a simple enough idea but a great way of making sure the ui stays in sync with model changes the above example uses a collection of assets but what if we want to bind a specific record for example the current user so you can display their name you can do that easily enough by passing a singleton option to connect var binder user connect user singleton true binder setitem currentuser binder render now whenever that currentuser record is changed the ui will be updated sometimes you don t every record in a model to be shown for example perhaps we only want published post s to be shown to achieve this just set the binder s filter attribute to a function that returns a boolean var binder posts connect post binder filter function post return post published binder render templates often aren t enough so you can use a custom builder with superconnect the render event gets called on every item when it is rendered and superconnect gives you a listener shortcut renderitem and and attaches a delegate for the render event posts renderitem function e data this find name attr title  data name posts connect post render so the first step is to setup a global object called app that ll hold our application s state and variables var app new superclass app extend state new superapp let s create a views div containing two states index and edit these will serve as the two main application states viewing a list of contacts and editing one and div and div and div to tie the views div up to our application s state machine we need to do something like this and and tie up app state to views on page load jquery function app state view new superapp view views next step is to create our application s models in this example we ve only got one namely contact var contact supermodel setup contact contact attributes name  email our first state index will list all the contacts displaying their name and email we need to create a div within the index view state with a data name of contacts this will contain a list of child divs the contacts span name email and span and div and div and div now we need to create the js state that s associated with our index view let s bind that list up to the contact model so when new contacts are created they ll be displayed in the list function var state app state add index state hasview true state setup function this binder this contacts connect contact this binder render   now we can test our rudimentary application out before that though let s make sure there s a default state and some test data jquery function and and load default state app state change index and and test data contact create name donna moss  email donn whitehouse gov  contact create name donna moss  email donn whitehouse gov  now if you open the page if everything s working correctly you should see a list of contacts seeing our contacts list is all very well but what if we want to edit one let s implement the edit state view containing a form which we ll use to update the contacts form data name form input type text name name value name placeholder name autofocus input type text name email value email placeholder email button update and button and form and div and div and here s the javascript state for that view when we re changing to the edit state we ll specify a contact that is to be edited since this state only displays one record it s a singleton we therefore need to call setitem every time the state is entered changing the displayed contact function var state app state add edit state hasview true state setup function this binder this contact connect contact singleton true   state beforeenter function contact this current contact this binder setitem this current this binder render   now we want to be able to navigate between the states let s add an edit button in the index state list of contacts and when we setup the index state we need to listen to click events on that edit button jquery fn item returns the record that s associated with that element in this case the clicked contact this contacts delegate a edit  click  function app state change edit  this item now we can click edit on a contact and see a populated form however the update button doesn t do anything at the moment let s rectify that by listening to submit events on the form updating the current contact with the form input values we re calling jquery fn reload since when the view is updated the this form variable points to a non existent element and therefore is invalid this form live submit  this proxy function this current updateattributes this form reload serializeform app state change index return false right now we ve got the read and update parts of crud but what about creating let s add a form to the bottom of the index view state form data name form h new contact and h input type text name name placeholder name input type text name email placeholder email button create and button and form and let s listen to the submit event on this form when setting up the index state creating a new contact record when the update button is pressed this form submit this proxy function contact create this form serializeform this form find input val return false letting the user delete contacts is trivially easy let s add a delete link after the edit one on the index view now when setting up the index state lets listen to click events on the delete link destroying the appropriate contact this contacts delegate a delete  click  function this item destroy this is a one liner we just need to extend the contact model with supermodel marshal contact extend supermodel marshal take out the example data as otherwise we ll get new contacts created every page reload that s all there is to creating a contacts manager hopefully you can now see how easy it is to make javascript applications with super js

667429, node python binding  i bumped this up from playground to binding on account of it starting to feel like the right thing to do this is a binding between node js and python unfortunately as written it actually embeds a python process inside of node it s of extremely alpha quality and was originally written with the intent of getting a better understanding of the internals of both v and cpython but yeah okay so the cool things var sys require sys var python require and binding var pysys python import sys sys puts pysys tostring will output python s sys path and passing in arguments works too var python require and binding  os python import os  cwd os getcwd  basename os path basename cwd var sys require sys sys puts basename tostring unfortunately python objects are not really fully translated into native javascript objects yet you have to cast them from whatever they are into whatever you want them to be at the moment the only provided cast is tostring  but that should change in the near future hopefully passing python objects that you get from calling python functions from javascript can seamlessly be passed back into python functions no casting required currently there s what i assume to be a passable argument translation implementation for simple objects ones that act like dicts  arrays numbers maybe  and strings you can slap together a tiny wsgi hosting thing on it as well which is provided in wsgi js it s half implemented but it s midnight on a sunday and i should probably sleep installation  i ve only tested this out on my computer so no huge promises can be made about other platforms running osx    node waf configure build in theory this is all you need in the entire world

817045, goalie is a flexible dynamic error response renderer for rails built on rack and rails engines it provides the same default error pages as rails but allows you to easily customize them with dynamic content this means you can use your application layout have different error pages for different subdomains and do all sorts nice gem install goalie after you install it and add it to your gemfile  you have to require it together with rails frameworks at the top of your config and application rb file require goalie and rails this will remove rails default exception renderer middleware showexceptions and use goalie s instead unless you have custom static pages in your public directory which we plan to support later  this will be a drop in replacement the public production rescuing of errors is done by the publicerrorscontroller found in goalie s app and controllers directory if you create a controller with the same name it will automatically be used instead of goalie s all it needs to do is support the following actions internalservererror notfound unprocessableentity conflict methodnotallowed notimplemented if you don t actually need a separate action for each of these errors you can redirect them to others for example with def unprocessableentity render action internalservererror you can also customize only the views and use goalie s default controller all you need is to have inside app and views and publicerrors views with the same names as the actions listed above besides the standard stuff that rails makes available to views you will also have access to the following instance variables if you include the goalie errordetails module request exception applicationtrace frameworktrace fulltrace be very careful when using this in production as you could expose sensitive information inside the request and exception generally you probably shouldn t use these variables at all the only place it makes sense is to have a more detailed error screen for admins or other high level users by default these details are not available to the public errors views but can be made available if you override the publicerrorscontroller and include the goalie errordetails module goalie copies a lot of code and ideas from rails showexceptions middleware rails default error views rails exceptionnotification plugin help from various contributors we re highly indebted to them and thank them a lot for their work any form of feedback patches issues and documentation are highly appreciated

276093, tao is a base theme for drupal that is all about going with the flow it is not meant for general purpose use but instead takes care of several tasks so that sub themes can get on with their job aggressive resets of not only browser default styles but drupal core defaults unification of several template families into a single consistent format e g node tpl php block tpl php etc theme overrides of several core annoyances fieldsets pagers on screen print stylesheet display and framework for further customized print tao makes several assumptions about how you the themer would like to work with drupal and the theme system minimize template overrides and leverage preprocessors as much as possible preference for generalized styling over exceptions and particular design of one off elements high degree of control over css particularly selector specificity overview for subthemers  the following is a comprehensive list of things to know about tao as a subthemer tao leaves most core element markup alone when things don t make sense however it makes changes and aggressive ones at that here s a list of things to expect theme fieldset the fieldset element in core has been retained but with additional markup for simpler theming the legend element contains a sub element span that can be positioned properly across browsers and the main contents of the fieldset follow other object templates with a fieldset content div theme formelement to distinguish between different instances of the form item wrapper tao adds a form item labeled class to labeled items and form item option to checkboxes and radios theme pager all numeric page links are grouped together into a ul pager list set next and previous links are grouped together under ul pager links theme username all username instances are wrapped in an a username or span username the vars attr variable is the standard way for adding any html attribute to the major containing element of the corresponding template the drupalattributes attr is used in each template to render attributes for example to add a class to a node you would add the following to your subtheme s node preprocessor vars attr class myclass tao implements an aggressive reset css but also strips out the inclusion of many of the css files included in core with the exception of colors css and locale css see tao info for the specifics tao reimplements and consolidates drupal core css styles in a way that will not affect a typographical or other strict grid in drupal css that can be overridden by sub themes for even greater control tao does not remove any contrib css added from other module directories e g sites and all and modules or profiles and myprofile and modules note the main reason for the stripping of core css is to achieve consistent typography and grid layout many styles in drupal core add inconsistent padding  line height  and font size adjustments to elements making it extremely costly to hunt down individual instances and correct them tao allows a site s print stylesheets to be previewed by checking whether get print is set for example to preview a node s print stylesheets you like support for full expansion of a book tree on print has been added tao does not use the all key for any of its stylesheets and expects that you will not either be specific if the stylesheet is for the screen or for print say so any stylesheet overrides your subtheme provides should use the same media key as the one in tao info for the stylesheet that is being overridden reset css provides browser css style resets and core styling resets override this in your subtheme only if you need to add or omit certain reset drupal css reimplements core css styles that are functionally important without allowing any modifications to a typographical or layout grid base css provides very basic structural non aesthetic styling for many elements see inline comments for more information print css is a default print stylesheet override this in your subtheme to alter print styling entirely all of the following theme functions go through the exact same template in tao with the exception of node and fieldset which go through slightly modified versions for better usability and compatibility with contrib modules theme block theme box theme comment theme fieldset theme node the template is designed to follow a strict pattern each element is classed as themehook elementtype with the name of its hook and then the type of wrapping element within the template for example for a node the following elements are provided node title  node content  node links etc for comments the corresponding classes would be comment title  comment content  comment links and so on issue tracking  the code for tao is hosted on github please report issues and submit maintainer  yhahn young hahn
