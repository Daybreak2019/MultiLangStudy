5808540, this library is the websockets of the s somebody at hacker news this library shows how to achieve realtime text communication using gif images as transport the interesting part is that you can even use ie with this library and get the data in real time tm of course this should have been delivered as an april s fools joke but sadly we are in mid september here in the northern hemisphere the idea is pretty simple we use animated gif images to stream data in real time to the browser since a gif image doesn t specify how many frames it has once the browser opens it it will keep waiting for new frames until you send the bits indicating that there s no more image to fetch pretty simple uh and yes it works in ie the usage now is a bit rudimentary and manual feel free to improve it and send a pr git clone git and and github com and videlalvaro and gifsockets git cd gifsockets lein deps lein repl then perform the following commands on the clojure repl clojure in the repl do the following to import the libs use gifsockets core use gifsockets server then we declare the tcp server def server tcp server port  handler gif handler start server wait for a browser connection on port  in chrome it works a bit laggy and in firefox it doesn t work at all now let s create the gif encoder that we use to write messages to the browser def encoder create gif getoutputstream client now we are ready to send messages to that browser client add message encoder hello gif sockets now you should see a gif image with the new message on it add message encoder zup zup zup add message encoder and so forth now let s clean up and close the connection finish encoder close client as you can see from the code this handles only one connection in what is called an upoc uber proof of concept all joking aside i think this is a very low tech way to have say a website where you could tail logs for instance and you need to do it with a browser that have zero websockets support or something like that or what about progress bars for stuff that your server is doing in the background say while it resizes an image yes you need gifsockets copyright   alvaro videla the following classes animatedgifencoder java gifdecoder java lzwencoder java neuquant java the awesome image that illustrates this page was given by the internet distributed under the eclipse public license the same as clojure
885487, juggernaut gives you a realtime connection between your servers and client browsers you can literally push data to clients using your web application which lets you do awesome things like multiplayer gaming chat group collaboration and more ruby client supports the following protocols websocket adobe flash socket activex htmlfile ie server sent events opera xhr with multipart encoding xhr with long polling horizontal scaling reconnection support ssl support as you can see juggernaut supports a variety of protocols if one isn t supported by a client juggernaut will fallback to one that is supported browsers are desktop internet explorer   safari  google chrome  firefox  opera   iphone safari ipad safari android webkit webos webkit node js ruby optional brew install node if you re using the brew package use that brew install redis npm install g juggernaut this step is optional but if you re planning on using juggernaut with ruby you ll need the gem gem install juggernaut start redis redis server start juggernaut juggernaut everything in juggernaut is done within the context of a channel javascript clients can subscribe to a channel which your server can publish to first we need to include juggernaut s application js file by default juggernaut is hosted on port  so we can just link to the file there we then need to instantiate the juggernaut object and subscribe to the channel as you can see subscribe takes two arguments the channel name and a callback script type text and javascript charset utf  var jug new juggernaut jug subscribe channel  function data console log got data and data  and script that s it for the client side now to publish to the channel we ll write some ruby require juggernaut juggernaut publish channel  some data as well as strings we can even pass objects like so juggernaut publish channel  some data the publish method also takes an array of channels in case you want to send a message to multiple channels co currently juggernaut publish channel  channel  foo  bar that s pretty much the gist of it the two methods publish and subscribe couldn t be easier than that adobe flash is optional but it s the default fallback for a lot of browsers until websockets are supported however flash needs a xml policy file to be served from port  which is restricted you ll need to run juggernaut with root privileges in order to open that port sudo juggernaut you ll also need to specify the location of websocketmain swf either copy this file from juggernaut s public directory to the root public directory of your application or specify it s location before instantiating juggernaut juggernaut has ssl support to activate just put create a folder called keys in the juggernaut directory containing your privatekey pem and certificate pem files mkdir keys cd keys openssl genrsa out privatekey pem  openssl req new key privatekey pem out certrequest csr openssl x req in certrequest csr signkey privatekey pem out certificate pem then pass the secure option when instantiating juggernaut in javascript var juggernaut new juggernaut secure true all juggernaut s communication will now be encrypted by ssl the only centralised i e potential bottle neck part to juggernaut is redis redis can support hundreds of thousands writes a second so it s unlikely that will be an issue scaling is just a case of starting up more juggernaut node servers all sharing the same redis instance put a tcp load balancer in front them distribute clients with a round robin approach and use sticky sessions it s worth noting that the latest websocket specification breaks support for a lot of http load balancers so it s safer just using a tcp one juggernaut s javascript client has a few events that you can bind to connect disconnect reconnect juggernaut also triggers data events in the context of an channel you can bind to that event by just passing a callback to the subscribe function var jug new juggernaut please go back online to use this service dialog autoopen false modal true width  resizable false closeonescape false title connection jug on connect  function offline dialog close jug on disconnect  function offline dialog open and and once we call subscribe juggernaut tries to connnect jug subscribe channel  function data console log got data and data it s a common use case to send messages to every client except one for example this is a common chat scenario user creates chat message user s client appends the message to the chat log so the user sees it instantly user s client sends an ajax request to the server notifying it of the new chat message the server then publishes the chat message to all relevant clients now the issue above is if the server publishes the chat message back to the original client in which case it would get duplicated in the chat logs as it already been created we can resolve this issue by recording the client s juggernaut id and then passing it as an except option when juggernaut publishes you can pass the juggernaut session id along with any ajax requests by hooking into beforesend  which is triggered by jquery before sending any ajax requests the callback is passed an xmlhttprequest which we can use to set a custom header specifying the session id var jug new juggernaut jquery beforesend function xhr xhr setrequestheader x session id  jug sessionid now when we publish to a channel we can pass the except option with the current client s session id juggernaut publish and chat  params body  except request headers x session id now the original client won t get the duplicated chat message even if it s subscribed to the  and chat channel when a client connects disconnects juggernaut triggers a callback you can listen to these callbacks from the ruby client juggernaut subscribe do and event data and use event and data the event is either subscribe or unsubscribe the data variable is just a hash of the client details channel channel  sessionid   meta foo you ll notice there s a meta attribute in the server event example above juggernaut lets you attach meta data to the client object which gets passed along to any server events for example you could set user id meta data then you would know which user was subscribing and unsubscribing to channels you could use this information to build a live roster of online users var jug new juggernaut jug meta userid  import redis import json msg channels channel  data foo r redis redis r publish juggernaut  json dumps msg similar to the python example we can use a node js redis adapter to publish to juggernaut var redis require redis var msg channels channel  data foo var client redis createclient client publish juggernaut  json stringify msg so let s take all we ve learnt about juggernaut and apply it to something practical a live chat roster class roster supermodel base include supermodel redis model include supermodel timestamp model belongsto user validatespresenceof userid indexes userid now let s integrate the roster class with juggernaut we re going to listen to juggernaut s server events fetching the userid out of the events meta data and calling eventsubscribe or eventunsubscribe depending on the event type def self subscribe juggernaut subscribe do and event data and userid data meta data meta userid next unless userid  case event when subscribe eventsubscribe userid when unsubscribe eventunsubscribe userid end end let s implement those two methods eventsubscribe eventunsubscribe we need to take into account they may be called multiple times for a particular userid if a user opens multiple browser windows co currently def eventsubscribe userid record findbyuserid userid and and self new userid userid record increment def eventunsubscribe userid record findbyuserid userid record record decrement we need to add a count attribute to the roster class so we can track if a client has completely disconnected from the system whenever clients subscribes to a channel increment  will get called and the count attribute will be incremented conversly whenever they disconnect from that channel decrement  will get called and count decremented attributes count def count readattribute count and and  def increment self count and  save def decrement self count  self count  save destroy when decrement  is called we check to see if the count is zero i e a client is no longer connected and destroy the record if necessary now at this point we have a live list of roster records indicating who s online we just need to call roster subscribe say in a rails script file and juggernaut events will be processed and usr and bin and env ruby require file expandpath and and config and environment  file puts starting roster roster subscribe there s no point however in having a live roster unless we can show that to users which is the subject of the next section observing models we can create an juggernaut observer which will observe some of the models notifying clients when they re changed class juggernautobserver activemodel observer observe roster def aftercreate rec publish create rec end def afterupdate rec publish update rec end def afterdestroy rec publish destroy rec end protected def publish type rec channels array rec observerclients map and c and and observer and c juggernaut publish channels  id rec id type type klass rec class name record rec   end so you can see we re calling the publish method whenever a record is created and updated and destroyed you ll notice that we re calling observerclients on the updated record this is a method that application specific and needs to be implemented on the roster class it needs to return an array of userids associated with the record so as to the javascript side to the observer we need to subscribe to a observer channel and set a callback now whenever a roster record is created and destroyed the process function will be called we can then update the ui accordingly var process function msg and and msg klass and and msg type and and msg id and and msg record var jug new juggernaut jug subscribe and observer and and userid process

1705750, flux slider is a css animation based image transition framework inspired in part by the fantastic nivo slider nivo devstudios com jquery plugin instead of the traditional javascript timer based animations used by jquery flux utilises the newer more powerful css animation technology its in a fairly early and rough state at the moment but testing on the iphone and ipad does appear to produce much smoother animations desktop performance as with nivo is very smooth but the use of css enables us to produce some new effects that nivo can t e g rotations the aim is to use hardware acceleration where possible to improve performance on less powerful devices such as mobiles tablets safari blackberry playbook firefox  opera  android known to be jerky due to lack of hardware acceleration create html markup with the images you wish to use you can also wrap images in a link if you need them to be clickable for example next instantiate flux slider function window myflux new flux slider slider or if you re using the provided jquery widget then you can also do the following function window myflux slider flux note if you plan to use the zepto framework then the widget method won t work note if you have a need to initialise flux before the ready event not recommended then you will need to use modernizr for feature detection as the inbuilt code does not play well with an uninitialised dom the flux slider constructor can also take an optional second parameter which is an object of key and value configuration options autoplay boolean default true whether or not the slider should start to play automatically pagination boolean default false whether or not to show a pagination control for manually selecting the image to show controls boolean default false whether or not to show a next and prev controls captions boolean default false whether or not to show a caption bar captions are read from the title attribute of loaded img elements transitions array default all available transitions an array with the names of the transitions to use available options are and d bars blinds blocks blocks concentric dissolve requires mask support slide warp zip and d barsd blindsd cube tilesd turn delay integer default  the number of milliseconds to wait between image transitions for example to prevent autoplay and show a pagination control you would do the following function window myflux new flux slider slider  autoplay false pagination true or with the jquery widget function window myflux slider flux autoplay false pagination true the api functions work with both the native javascript object and the jquery widget for example and and show next image using the barsd transition native javascript object window myflux next barsd and and show next image using the barsd transition jquery widget window myflux flux next  barsd note all the jquery widget functions are chainable except those that return something specific such as isplaying getimage start enable autoplay stop disable autoplay isplaying returns a boolean as to whether autoplay is currently enabled next transition  options show the next image transition optional the name of the transition to use otherwise one picked at random options optional transition specific options for this transition only prev transition  options show the previous image transition optional the name of the transition to use otherwise one picked at random options optional transition specific options for this transition only showimage index  transition  options show the image at index transition optional the name of the transition to use otherwise one picked at random options optional transition specific options for this transition only getimage index returns the image with the provided index there are occasions where you may wish to know when a transition has completed or that the currently displayed image has changed flux provides a couple of mechanisms for this after each transition flux dispatches a fluxtransitionend event to listen for these events you can do the following slider bind fluxtransitionend  function event var img event data currentimage and and do something with img you can alternatively pass in a callback function as part of the configuration options when you instantiate flux e g window myflux slider flux autoplay false pagination true ontransitionend function data var img data currentimage and and do something with img writing your own custom transitions is easy you just need to create an instance of a flux transition object and pass in some callback functions to provide the custom behaviour you re looking for lets look at the built in bars transition as an example the barebones definition of the transition looks like flux transitions bars function fluxslider opts return new flux transition fluxslider extend barwidth  setup function execute function  opts here we add a new function to the flux transitions namespace called bars this function takes two parameters a flux slider object and an options key and value object note its currently not possible to pass options into transitions from the core flux slider code but as this is on the list of things to add its a good idea to make sure the transitions can handle this when its implemented the function we create should return a new flux transition object passing in the flux slider parameter along with a set of options all transition objects automatically have access to the following this slider the flux slider object passed into the constructor from this object you can access the current image this slider image and the next image this slider image this options the options passed in as the nd parameter to the flux transition constructor call two functions are needed for the transition to operate first is setup this function is responsible for initialising the dom before the transition runs in the case of the bars transition this function creates a div for each bar and set the background image so that adjacent bars appear as a single image the setup function should also initialise the css properties needed to enable a css transition setup function var barcount math floor this slider image width and this options barwidth and  var delaybetweenbars  for var i  i barcount i and and width this options barwidth and px  height   position absolute  top   left i this options barwidth and px  background image this slider image css background image  background position and i this options barwidth and px px css transition duration ms  transition timing function ease in  transition property all  transition delay i delaybetweenbars and ms this slider image append bar a helper function called css has been created for convenience to automatically add vendor prefixes to css properties any properties that require prefixes should be added via this function rather than css as this ensures that transitions are cross browser compatible the execute function is where the css changes should be made as transitions have already been initialised in setup applying the end css property state should be all thats required execute function var this this var height this slider image height var bars this slider image find div bar and and get notified when the last transition has completed bars bars length  transitionend function this finished bars css opacity   css transform flux browser translate  height two further convenience functions have been used in this example the first transitionend is a cross browser event function to catch the transition end event in this example we want to be notified when the final bar as finished animating this is how we know the transition is complete we can then perform some custom code but its important to remember to call the transitions finished function to ensure that the dom is reset for the next transition here are some guidelines for writing transitions if you d like to have them considered for inclusion into the main distribution if the transition requires d transforms you must set the requiresd property to true e g flux transitions barsd function fluxslider opts return new flux transition fluxslider extend requiresd true setup function for delaying animations to specific bars and blocks and tiles use webkit and moz and o transition delay rather than settimeout and setinterval this enables the gpu to handle the timing and makes for smoother transitions when using many new bars and blocks and tiles add them to a container element off dom and then add the container in one go e g for var i  i  i and and container append elem this image slider append container flux browser is an object designed to help determine browser support for css transitions supportstransitions boolean does the current browser support css transitions supportsd boolean does the current browser support d css transitions translate x y z returns a css translate string most suitable for the current browser for example under ios where d transformations are supported flux browser translate   would return translated    so as to trigger hardware acceleration rotate axis deg operates the same as the above translate function and returns the most suitable css for the current browser rotatex deg returns the result of calling flux browser rotate x  deg requires d transformation support rotatey deg returns the result of calling flux browser rotate y  deg requires d transformation support rotatez deg returns the result of calling flux browser rotate z  deg

1404348, mongoose auth  user authentication plugin for mongoose node js orm mongoose auth enables you to support authorization in any number of ways via authorization strategies an authorization strategy is how you authorize your user currently mongoose auth supports the following authorization strategies password facebook twitter github instagram google mongoose auth does  things  schema decoration  optional drop in routing for  optional dynamic helpers for to help it take care of the routing and helpers everyauth is a general purpose npm module for authentication authorization that can be used independently of mongoose as you add successive authorization strategies mongoose auth at a bare minimum augments your schema with typed attributes corresponding to parameters related to your chosen authorization strategies for example if facebook is one of your authorization strategies then it will add attributes to your user schema such as fb id and fb email to decorate your schema javascript var mongoose require mongoose  schema mongoose schema  mongooseauth require mongoose auth var userschema new schema userschema plugin mongooseauth facebook true applications require more than just user schema augmentation in order to implement a complete authorization strategy applications also need routes exposing the one or more steps involved for a given authorization strategy moreover applications each handle in their own unique way how they want to respond to successful or failed logins in addition to logout handling if you are not using a set all of this up yourself in this case mongoose auth only provides you with schema decoration but if you are building your app on top of provides drop in solutions for you here is how you can get access to the routing that mongoose auth provides not the step x comments javascript var mongoose require mongoose  schema mongoose schema  mongooseauth require mongoose auth var userschema new schema  user and and step  schema decoration and configuration for the routing userschema plugin mongooseauth and and here we attach your user model to every module everymodule everyauth user function return user     facebook everyauth  appid your app id here  appsecret your app secret here  redirectpath and   mongoose model user  userschema mongoose connect mongodb and and localhost and example user mongoose model user var app express createserver express bodyparser  express static dirname and and public  express cookieparser  express session secret esoognom and and step  add in the routing  mongooseauth middleware and and important do not add app router to your middleware chain and and explicitly or you will run into problems accessing req user and and i e  do not use app use app router let express do this for you and and automatically for you upon your first app get or app post and and step  add in dynamic view helpers only if you are using express mongooseauth helpexpress app app listen  in step  of the last code sample we are adding dynamic view helpers for if this automically gives you access to a convenient everyauth local variable from your view so you do not have to pass req as a local to your view everyauth loggedin a boolean getter that tells you if the request is by a logged in user everyauth user the mongoose user document associated with the session everyauth facebook the is equivalent to what is stored at req session auth facebook  so you can do things like everyauth facebook user returns the user json provided from the oauth provider everyauth facebook accesstoken returns the accesstoken provided from the oauth provider for authorized api calls on behalf of the user and you also get this pattern for other modules e g  everyauth twitter user  everyauth github user  etc you also get access to the view helper user the same as everyauth user above as an example of how you would use these consider the following and views and user jade jade template user id label user id value user id facebook id label user facebook id value everyauth facebook user id the step  add in the routing step in the last code sample also provides convenience methods on the serverrequest instance req from any scope that has access to req  you get the following convenience getter and method req loggedin a boolean getter that tells you if the request is by a logged in user req user the mongoose user document associated with the session req logout clears the sesion of your auth data you can also use multiple authorization strategies in the same application here is an example using  authorization strategies javascript and and a configuration file for holding all of your and and rd party oauth credentials var conf require and conf userschema plugin mongooseauth and and here we attach your user model to every module everymodule everyauth user function return user     facebook everyauth  appid conf fb appid  appsecret conf fb appsecret  redirectpath and    twitter everyauth  consumerkey conf twit consumerkey  consumersecret conf twit consumersecret  redirectpath and    password everyauth getloginpath and login  postloginpath and login  loginview login jade  getregisterpath and register  postregisterpath and register  registerview register jade  loginsuccessredirect and  registersuccessredirect and    github everyauth  appid conf github appid  appsecret conf github appsecret  redirectpath and    instagram everyauth  appid conf instagram clientid  appsecret conf instagram clientsecret  redirectpath and   to run it cd example node server js a common recipe is allowing a user to login via multiple accounts and to link those accounts under one user document this can be done in the following way i document everyauth more and document mongoose auth s relationship to everyauth in everyauth s design every auth module is defined as a set of steps which are exposed in such a way for you to over ride the step that is of particular interest for this scenario is the findorcreateuser step required by every everyauth module mongoose auth defines a default version of this findorcreateuser step for each everyauth auth module it supports you can find these default definitions in lib and modules and modulename and everyauth js e g  see so for example this is how you would over ride the default findorcreateuser step for the facebook module if you are using both the facebook and password module javascript userschema plugin mongooseauth facebook everyauth myhostname   findorcreateuser function session accesstok accesstokextra fbuser var promise this promise  user this user user findbyid session auth userid function err user if err return promise fail err if user user where password login  fbuser email findone function err user if err return promise fail err if user user createwithfb fbuser accesstok accesstokextra expires function err createduser if err return promise fail err return promise fulfill createduser  else assignfbdatatouser user accesstok accesstokextra fbuser user save function err user if err return promise fail err promise fulfill user    else assignfbdatatouser user accesstok accesstokextra fbuser  and and save the new data to the user doc in the db user save function err user if err return promise fail err promise fuilfill user     return promise and and make sure to return the promise that promises the user and and assign all properties see lib and modules and facebook and schema js for details function assignfbdatatouser user accesstok accesstokextra fbuser user fb accesstoken accesstok user fb expires accesstokextra expires user fb id fbuser id user fb name first fbuser firstname and and etc more assigning as this is a common recipe i plan on adding support for this into everyauth and mongoose auth  so it s more drop in and developers do not have to add this custom code themselves the intent is for common things like this to be invisible to the developer so it just works like magic so in the near future you won t have to over ride the findorcreateuser step every time you want this feature this will be coming soon by default everyauth and therefore mongoose auth use the attribute login as the default attribute used for logging in with the password module however the need can arise to use a different attribute such as email that implies a different schema use email string instead of login string in addition to different validation assumptions email validations are more strict that login handle validations luckily mongoose auth provide support for this out of the box all you need to do is look for the line labeled this next line is the only addition javascript userschema plugin mongooseauth and and here we attach your user model to every module everymodule everyauth user function return user   password and and this next line is the only addition loginwith email and and or loginwith phone  everyauth getloginpath and login  postloginpath and login  loginview login jade  getregisterpath and register  postregisterpath and register  registerview register jade  loginsuccessredirect and  registersuccessredirect and  automatically mongoose auth will use an email string attribute in your user schema instead of the default login string attribute moreover it will automatically add in validation checks to make sure that the email is valid before registering a user through the registration process of the password module sometimes your registration will ask for more information from the user besides the login and password for this particular scenario you can configure extraparams javascript userschema plugin mongooseauth and and here we attach your user model to every module everymodule everyauth user function return user   password extraparams phone string  name first string  last string    everyauth getloginpath and login  postloginpath and login  loginview login jade  getregisterpath and register  postregisterpath and register  registerview register jade  loginsuccessredirect and  registersuccessredirect and  what this effectively does is  adds phone  name first  and name last as attributes to your userschema  automatically extracts the registration parameters after a visitor submits the registration form and saves them to a new user document the registration form input name s should be e g  in the example above phone  name first  and name last for a live example this one ha come up enough that it is here as a recipe even though it is not specific to mongoose auth suppose you want to add a special attribute such as roles string to your userschema this is something that you can do using just mongoose javascript var userschema new mongoose schema roles string  and and other custom attributes userschema plugin mongooseauth and and mongooseauth adds other attributes to your userschema and and depending on the auth modules you choose currently mongoose auth does password authentication by login and password suppose you also want to authenticate by checking against an additional parameter like active  which is a boolean attribute on your userschema that indicates whether this user has been activated or not then you can modify the authenticate everyauth step in the following way javascript var userschema new schema active boolean  user userschema plugin mongooseauth everymodule everyauth user function return user   password loginwith email  everyauth getloginpath and login  postloginpath and login  loginview login jade  getregisterpath and register  postregisterpath and register  registerview register jade  loginsuccessredirect and  registersuccessredirect and and and what you add is the following and and the logic is adapted from the default authenticate and and implementation in lib and modules and

2629035, third party javascript providers globals prototypes and mismatched library versions can cause lots of compatibility headaches for third party code with lightningjs all of that third party code lives in its own separate window context if the code needs to do dom manipulation it still has access to the original document via window parent slowdowns in embedded third party code should never impact the original document traditional embed techniques can block window onload if the server responds slowly even when the embed itself is asynchronous with lightningjs third party server response time has zero impact on the original document it should even be safe to embed the code at the top of the body of the document for an added speed boost when customers are using your third party api asynchronicity can make usage a bit more complicated some libraries require manual creation of a callstack e g google analytics var gaq gaq push  and others try to hook into script onload events with lightningjs the third party namespace is immediately available as a callable function all calls return objects that adhere to the modifications to the existing api will enable these deferred calls let s say that we are pirates incorporated purveyors of all things lightningjs our embed code will look something like this script type text and javascript and literal cdata and and lightningjs embed min js and window piratelib lightningjs require piratelib  and and static piratelib com and piratelib js and and literal and and script our customers can call methods on piratelib immediately even though none of our code has actually loaded yet piratelib firewarningshot  direction starboard this calls the firewarningshot method on our api at some point we decide to return a value to our customers that indicates whether the warning shot was seen we also decide to throw exceptions in cases where the warning shot failed we can use the then fulfillmentcallback errorcallback method to handle return values and exceptions piratelib firewarningshot  direction starboard then function didsee if didsee and and arrr those landlubbers didn t see our warning shot we re no and and scallywags so run another shot across the bow piratelib firewarningshot  direction starboard   function error if error tostring crew refused and and blimey it s mutiny  the lightningjs api is pretty simple lightningjs require imports third party code lightningjs modules dictionary of all imported modules lightningjs provide exports third party code as a lightningjs module lightningjs expensive designates specific exported methods to execute only after the original document is completely finished this step by step should get you up and running pretty quickly to make your own embed code just start with embed min js and then underneath that code you can simply use lightningjs require to pull in your library for example if you named your library namespace piratelib  then your final embed code might look something like this script type text and javascript and literal cdata and and lightningjs embed min js and window piratelib lightningjs require piratelib  and and static piratelib com and piratelib js and and literal and and script the extra guards around the code ensure that you avoid any issues with template engines e g drupal joomla etc and xhtml parsers as a third party provider it pays to be prepared for all kinds of document environments keep in mind that your code will be loaded in its own window context if you need to access the globals on the original document you should grab the window parent object you should also use window parent document to manipulate the dom some older codebases may rely on implicit globals in the original document if this is the case with your library you could try wrapping your code in a with context with window parent and and your existing codebase goes here if you want to utilize the asynchronous api that the embed code creates for your namespace you can do so by pasting the code from lightningjs bootstrap min js at the top of your codebase after doing this you need to tell lightningjs which methods need to be made available for asynchronous calling using the lightningjs provide method for example you could expose your firewarningshot method like so and lightningjs bootstrap min js and and piratelib library code and lightningjs provide piratelib  firewarningshot function options return piratelib firewarningshot options  tools like google pagespeed and yslow sometimes penalize pages for executing too much javascript before the page loads therefore you may want to avoid executing certain cpu or parsing intensive methods until after window onload so that your library does not cause any execution penalty for the original document to avoid executing expensive methods too early just decorate these methods using lightningjs expensive lightningjs will ensure that calls to these methods are delayed until after the original document completely loads lightningjs provide piratelib  loadtothegunwalls lightningjs expensive function and and this method instantiates lots of grog and iterates and and through each bottle in a loop piratelib stockthegalley while piratelib bottlesofgrogonthewall piratelib takeonedownandpassitaround   exhaustive browser support really important for lightningjs to that end this loading approach has been battle tested in production by both thousands of websites and browsers the included tests have been verified to pass in every browser we could easily get our hands on firefox  and tested in               chrome  and tested in     internet explorer  and tested in     safari  and tested in       opera  and tested in    mobile safari  and tested in     the development cycle should be pretty straightforward  edit lightningjs embed js and lightningjs bootstrap js directly  add your test cases in test and test js you might need to add methods to the test library in test and testlib js  run the development server by executing bin and serve and visiting  click on the links for testing and benchmarking pages to see the effects of your changes don t forget to check multiple browsers especially older ones like ie  rebuild the components before committing your patches by executing bin and build feel free to fork make changes and send us a pull request you know the drill loading third party javascript is the core goal of lightningjs and that functionality has been battle tested in production scenarios however there are still some areas that need work gathering test results on more browsers older browsers more mobile browsers better testing of the promise api in production environments exposing the original document s ready event to the third party code working around additional server side templating systems so that more end users can paste code into their favorite cms there are lots of other relevant ideas that may be outside the scope of lightningjs designing an easy backwards compatibility layer for existing third party libraries incidentally though is it really a coincidence you can most of the lightningjs concepts build on work done by the fine javascript detailing the reasoning behind the different parts of the meebo embed code you can also find most of these techniques in use by the olark embed code which added cookie controlled cachebreaking of the library code download and also sidestepped some common templating engine incompatibilities the lightningjs project distills this work for the open source community by simplifying the process of including multiple arbitrary javascript files allowing out of the box handling of asynchronous library calls removing dependency on the meebo build system for information on traditional third party embed code as well as other important written up by a couple engineers from disqus other loaders exist with some similar goals though many are not as well suited for third party providers you should check out these alternatives particularly if you are trying to load files from your own domain

is a work in progress so please feel free to submit suggestions and and or corrections this document outlines basic usage to understand the background a little more have a look at the following  introduction and overview  snoopy consists of four components client software aka snoopy drone software server software web interface maltego transforms a snoopy drones  the client side software runs on what we call drones a drone can be any linux based device that has a wifi interface with injection drivers and outbound internet connectivity snoopy has been tested on a nokia n and a laptop running backtrack the drones perform the following two operations  collect probe ssids from nearby wireless devices  offer a rogue access point for nearby wireless devices to connect to collected probe requests e g bob s iphone looking for bthomehub  are uploaded to the snoopy server at regular intervals all devices that associate to the rogue ap have have their internet served via the snoopy server b server software  the server populates all probe requests into a database and uses wigle to determine gps coordinates and google maps to determine street addresses and street view photographs this means that if you re probing for your home network i may get a photograph of your house each drone connects to the server over openvpn and has its own subnet associated clients receive an ip address from the drone and route traffic via it this means that on the server we can match client ip addresses and therefore mac addresses to internet activity on the server the following happens internet traffic is transparently proxied through squid which logs all requests to mysql sslstrip attempts to rewrite webpages without https mitmproxy py allows arbitrary injection into web pages various scripts run to extract social media data e g pulling facebook profiles the network diagram looks like so client drone snoopy server and and and and and and and wlan and wifi and at and and eth

transforms  several maltego transforms exist to graphically explore collected data see below for more info  installation  server installation should be straight forward it s only been tested on a stock install of ubuntu   lts bit changes are made to several server components so it s highly recommended to run the install script on a base installation and not run much else on that box if anything if in doubt go through the install sh file and manually make the changes otherwise just run and install sh the installer once installation is finished you should just be able to type snoopy for the server menu to load if not or in doubt go to the home directory of the user created during the installation phase inside the snoopy and server and directory there is a snoopy sh file which you may run below is the menu and and and welcome to snoopy v  and and server side and and and and sensepost information security and and research sensepost com and www sensepost com and and and date thu

configuration packs  configure server options  set web traffic injection string  observe logs x exit help  creating drone packs option  in the menu will allow you to create client side packs for your drone devices each drone gets its own openvpn and ssh keys dhcp ranges and routing tables you will be provided with a download url per drone device make sure your server and drone have their time set correctly or the vpn connection will not establish  installing and running snoopy on the drone you may have up to  drones if you want more check the source or email me there s no actual limitation installation consists of downloading the configuration pack from the previous step and running the relevant setup script for the nokia n an icon will be placed on your desktop e g haxor drone tar xzvf drone tar gz haxor drone cd snoopy and setupn sh  looking up ssid locations create an account on www wigle net and set your credentials via configure server options  web interface  exploring data with maltego in the snoopy server menu go to configure server options maltego here you will see urls for downloading snoopy entities machines and urls for transforms in order to use maltego transforms you will need to add snoopy entities to maltego login to cetas paterva com and tds and create a seed on cetas paterva com and tds and add the transform urls to the created seed add the seed in maltego manage discover transforms advanced enter the name as snoopy  and the seed url as your seed add the snoopy machines to the machines section each snoopy entity can have different transforms applied to it drag the snoopy entity on to your graph to get started if you don t specify a start or end date in the entities properties it will fetch results for the last  minutes by default this value can be changed in the server configuration menu the snoopy machines allow you to automatically sequence transforms and filter and delete nodes based on requirements the source and comments should sufficiently outline how they work  legal considerations  all or some of the snoopy components may be illegal where you live please find out before using the software in the united kingdom the probe collection component is legal due to the broadcast nature of the traffic however the rogue access point component is most likely illegal in most regions sensepost takes no responsibility for you getting into trouble from using this tool  security considerations  each drone pack contains openvpn and ssh keys if a drone is compromised by theft or otherwise it may pose a security risk to your server it is highly recommended that your snoopy server run dedicated in its purpose the user created on the server has the following automatically added to the ssh and authorizedhosts file  for a little bit of extra security no port forwardingno x forwardingno agent forwardingno ptycommand and usr and bin and rsync sshoriginalcommand  future work  there are lots of thing still to be done and

and bin and snoopy and src and snoopy and plug ins consist of two parts back end data providing part written in python front end displaying part written in javascript optional a plug in is a callable that is dynamically loaded by the snoopy application let s start with an example from snoopy import db pluginregistry pluginregistry add client data  ssidlist  ssid list  js and static and js and ssidlist js def ssidlist mac with db sessionctx as session query session query distinct db probe probessid select distinct probessid from probes filterby devicemac mac where devicemac mac orderby db probe probessid order by probessid  return query all now for the blow by blow from snoopy import db pluginregistry we need db to access the snoopy database and pluginregistry to register our pluginregistry add client data  ssidlist  ssid list  js and static and js and ssidlist js this is how we register our plug in which can be any callable the first argument specifies the name of the group that this plug in falls into we specified client data  since this plug in accepts a mac address and returns data to be displayed in a client data window apart from client data  there is also the session data group of plug ins that operate on proximity sessions the second parameter is the plug in name this name is for internal use only and should be json friendly the third parameter is the plug in title essentially it is the same as the name but the title is displayed in the gui more specifically this is the title of the data section in the client data all keyword arguments after the title are saved as options while the plug in system does not require any options snoopy supports the js option this option specifies the url from the browser side not from snoopy s and the server s side of the javascript component of this plug in def ssidlist mac this plug in is a simple function it accepts a mac address string as per client data plug ins definition the name of the callable is not used the body of this example plug in simply performs a sqlalchemy query that basically does select distinct probessid from probes where devicemac mac and returns the results as a list the return values of plug ins are usually added as part of a json response therefore the results has the limitation that it must be json friendly as supported by flask s jsonify function as simple as that front end plug ins for client data are referred to as client data handlers they are registered via the snoopy registerplugin sectionname datahandler function sectionname is the name of the data section that the data handler wants to handle this name is the same as the back end plug in name that generated the data the datahandler must be a function with the following signature function section clientdata section is a jquery object of the div element where the data handler may display data or affect changes the client data generated by the back end plug in is given in the clientdata parameter since the data handler s only allowed output is changes to the given div section  no return value is necessary

1066410, gitmodel distributed versioned nosql for ruby  gitmodel is an versioning and remote syncing gitmodel persists ruby objects using git as a data storage engine it s an activemodel implementation so it works stand alone or in rails  as a drop in replacement for activerecord or datamapper because the database is a git repository it can be synced across multiple machines manipulated with standard git client tools can be branched and merged and of course keeps the history of all changes why it s awesome  schema less nosql data store each record is a normal ruby object attributes are any ruby type or large chunks of binary data never lose data history is kept forever and can be restored simply using standard git tools branch and merge your production data gitmodel can actually work with different branches branch or tag snapshots of your data experiment on production data using branches for example to test a migration distributed synced using standard git push and pull all activemodel transactions metadata for all database changes git commit messages date time etc in order to be easily human editable the database is simply files and directores stored in a git repository gitmodel uses the git repo directly rather than git s checked out working copy but you can do a git checkout to view and manipulate the database contents and then git commit test driven development and excellent test coverage clean and easy to use api it is not yet production ready but i m working on it please feel free to contribute tests and and or code to help  will be considered the first stable release until then the api may change at any time see the to do section below for details but the main thing that needs finishing is support for querying right now you can find an instance by it s id but there is incomplete support  complete for querying e g post find category ruby  date lambda and d and d  month ago orderby date order asc limit  this includes support for

attribute text c comment create id      text c comment create id      text database file structure  the database is stored in a human editable format simply do git checkout f and you ll see directories and files each type of object is stored in a top level directory this is analogous to activerecord tables  and each object is stored in a subdirectory which is named using the object s id i e the primary key attributes that are ruby types strings numbers hashes arrays whatever are stored in a file named attributes json and binary attributes blobs are stored in their own for example the database for the example above would have a directory structure that looks like this db root comments     attributes json     attributes json posts hotdog eating contest attributes json hotdogs jpg

configured like this gitmodel memcacheservers server  server  gitmodel memcachenamespace optionalnamespace the namespace is optional and usually not necessary because gitmodel will prepend the last segment of gitmodel dbroot anyway a git sha is also prepended to every key so that outdated versions will not be retrieved from the cache this is the sha of the latest commit so unfortunately this is only useful when there are not frequent commits because every commit invalidates the cache this is obviously not ideal and i m sure it can be improved upon there is still a lot of work to be done to make it faster first some analysis is required but some guesses about things that would help are remove the transaction lock see transaction rb line  ability to iterate over result set without eager loading of all instances contributing  do you have an improvement to make please submit a pull request on github or a patch including a test written with rspec to run all tests simply run bundle exec

3919729,
4967626, r is a map reduce engine written in python using a redis backend it s purpose is to be simple r has only three concepts to grasp input streams mappers and reducers the diagram below relates how they interact if the diagram above is a little too much to grasp right now don t worry keep reading and use this diagram later for reference a fairly simple map reduce example to solve is counting the number of occurrences of each word in an extensive document we ll use this scenario as our example installing  installing r is as easy as pip install r after successful installation you ll have three new commands r app  r map and r web running the app  in order to use r you must have a redis database running getting one up in your system is beyond the scope of this document we ll assume you have one running at     port  and configured to require the password r using database  the service that is at the heart of r is r app it is the web server that will receive requests for map reduce jobs and return the results to run r app  given the above redis back end type r app redis port  redis pass r c config py we ll learn more about the configuration file below given that you have a proper configuration file your r service will be as to how we actually perform a map reduce operation we ll see that after the running mappers section app configuration  in the above section we specified a file called config py as configuration now we ll see what that file contains the configuration file that we pass to the r app command is responsible for specifying input stream processors and reducers that should be enabled let s see a sample configuration file inputstreams test countwordsstream countwordsstream reducers test countwordsreducer countwordsreducer this configuration specifies that there should be a countwordsstream input stream processor and a countwordsreducer reducer both will be used by the stream service to perform a map reduce operation we ll learn more about input streams and reducers in the sections below the input stream  the input stream processor is the class responsible for creating the input streams upon which the mapping will occur in our counting words in a document sample the input stream processor class should open the document read the lines in the document and then return each line to r app let s see a possible implementation from os path import abspath dirname join class countwordsstream jobtype count words groupsize  def process self app arguments with open abspath join dirname file  chekhov txt as f contents f readlines return line lower for line in contents the jobtype property is required and specifies the relationship that this input stream has with mappers and with a specific reducer the groupsize property specifies how big is an input stream in the above example our input stream processor returns all the lines in the document but r will group the resulting lines in batches of  lines to be processed by each mapper how big is your group size varies wildly depending on what your mapping consists of running mappers  input stream processors and reducers are sequential and thus run in process in the r app mappers on the other hand are inherently parallel and are run on their own as independent worker units considering the above example of input stream and reducer we ll use a countwordsmapper class to run our mapper we can easily start the mapper with r map redis port  redis pass r mapper key mapper  mapper class test countwordsmapper countwordsmapper the redis port and redis pass arguments require no further explanation the mapper key argument specifies a unique key for this mapper this key should be the same once this mapper restarts the mapper class is the class r will use to map input streams let s see what this map class looks like if we are mapping lines what we got out of the input stream steap  we should return each word and how many times it occurs from r worker mapper import mapper class countwordsmapper mapper jobtype count words def map self lines return list self splitwords lines def splitwords self lines for line in lines for word in line split yield word  the jobtype property is required and specifies the relationship that this mapper has with a specific input stream and with a specific reducer after all input streams have been mapped it is time to reduce our data to one coherent value this is what the reducer does in the case of counting word occurrences a sample implementation is as from collections import defaultdict class countwordsreducer jobtype count words def reduce self app items wordfreq defaultdict int for line in items for word frequency in line wordfreq word and frequency return wordfreq the jobtype property is required and specifies the relationship that this reducer has with mappers and with a specific input stream this reducer will return a dictionary that contains all the words and the frequency with which they occur in the given file testing our solution  to test the above solution just clone r s repository and run the commands from the directory you just cloned given that we have the above working we should have r app running at our browser to this should return a json document with the resulting occurrences of words in the sample document creating my own reducers  as you have probably guessed creating new jobs of mapping and reducing is as simple as implementing your own input stream processor  mapper and reducer after they are implemented just include the processor and reducer in the config file and fire up as many mappers as you want monitoring r  we talked about three available commands r app  r map and r web the last one fires up a monitoring interface that helps you in understanding how your r farm

1365656, cloud haskell  this is cloud haskell it s a haskell framework for distributed applications basically it s a tool for writing applications that coordinate their work on a cluster of commodity computers or virtual machines this is useful for providing highly reliable redundant long running services as well as for building compute intensive applications that can benefit from lots of hardware the remainder of this file contains a slightly out of date introduction to programming with cloud haskell there are example programs included in the distribution cloud haskell has two interfaces an interface based on message passing between distributed processes think of it as erlang or mpi in haskell we call this part the process layer a fault tolerant data centric interface we call this part the task layer this layer makes it even easier to build distributed applications the framework automatically takes care of moving your data around and recovering from hardware failure this layer can be compared to google s mapreduce but is in fact more flexible installation  assuming you have the haskell platform installed just run this command from the cloud haskell directory cabal install remote you can then compile your own cloud haskell applications or try out the programs in the examples directory process layer an introduction  many programming languages expose concurrent programming as a shared memory model wherein multiple concurrently executing programs or threads can examine and manipulate variables common to them all coordination between threads is achieved with locks mutexes and other synchronization mechanisms in haskell these facilities are available as mvar s in contrast languages like erlang eschew shared data and require that concurrent threads communicate only by message passing the key insight of erlang and languages like it is that reasoning about concurrency is much easier without shared memory under a message passing scheme a thread provides a recipient given as a thread identifier and a unit of data that data will be transferred to the recipient s address space and placed in a queue where it can be retrieved by the recipient because data is never shared implicitly this is a particularly good model for distributed systems this framework presents a combined approach to distributed framework while it provides an erlang style message passing system it lets the programmer use existing concurrency paradigms from haskell nodes and processes  location is represented by a node usually a node corresponds to an instance of the haskell runtime system that is each independently executed haskell program exists in its own node multiple nodes may run concurrently on a single physical host system but the intention is that nodes run on separate hosts to take advantage of more hardware the basic unit of concurrency is the process as distinct from an os process a process is a concurrent calculation that can participate in messaging there is little overhead involved in starting and executing processes so programmers can start as many as they need code that runs in a process is in the processm monad process management  processes are created with the spawn function its type signatures will help explain its operation haskell spawn nodeid closure processm processm processid spawn takes a nodeid  indicating where to run the process and a closure  indicating which function will start the process this lets the programmer start arbitrary functions on other nodes which may be running on other hosts actual code is not transmitted to the other node instead a function identifier is sent this works on the assumption that all connected nodes are running identical copies of the compiled haskell binary unlike erlang which allows new code to be sent to remote nodes at runtime we encode the function identifier used to start remote processes in a closure closures for remotely callable functions are automatically generated and are named after the original function with a closure suffix therefore if i have a function like this haskell greet string processm greet name say hello and and name i can run it on some node and get its pid like this haskell pid spawn somenode greetclosure john baptist the greetclosure symbol here identifies a closure generator and is automatically created by the framework from user defined functions see the examples or documentation for more details you can send messages to a process given its pid the send function corresponds to erlang s operator haskell send serializable a processid a processm given a processid and a chunk of serializable data implementing the data binary binary type class  we can send a message to the given process the message will be transmitted across the network if necessary and placed in the process s message queue note that send will accept any type of data as long as it implements binary a process can receive messages by calling expect haskell expect serializable a processm a note that expect is also polymorphic the type of message to receive is usually inferred by the compiler if a message of that type is in the queue it will be returned if multiple messages of that type are in the queue they will be returned in fifo order if there are no messages of that type in the queue the function will block until such a message arrives a channel provides an alternative to message transmission with send and expect while send and expect allow transmission of messages of any type channels require messages to be of uniform type channels work like a distributed equivalent of haskell s control concurrent chan unlike regular channels distributed channels have distinct ends a single receiving port and at least one sending port create a channel with a call to newchannel haskell newchannel serializable a processm sendport a receiveport a the resulting sendport can be used with the sendchannel function to insert messages into the channel the receiveport can be used to receive messages with receivechannel the sendchannel can be serialized and sent as part of messages to other processes which can then write to it the receivechannel  though cannot be serialized although it can be accessed from multiple threads on the same node setup and walkthrough  here we ll provide a basic example of how to get started with your first project we ll be running a program that will estimate pi making use of available computing resources potentially on remote systems there will be an arbitrary number of nodes one of which will be designated the master and the remaining nodes will be slaves the slaves will estimate pi in such a way that their results can be combined by the master and an approximation will be output the more nodes and the longer they run the more precise the output in more detail the master will assign each slave a region of the halton sequence and the slaves will use elements of the sequence to estimate the ratio of points in a unit square that fall within a unit circle and that the master will sum these ratios here s the procedure step by step  compile pi hs if you have the framework installed correctly it should be sufficient to run ghc make pi  select the machines you want to run the program on and select one of them to be the master all hosts must be connected on a local area network for the purposes of this explanation we ll assume that you will run your master node on a machine named masterhost and you will run two slave nodes each on machines named slavehost and slavehost  copy the compiled executable pi to some location on each of the three hosts  for each node we need to create a configuration file this is plain text file usually named config and usually placed in the same directory with the executable there are many possible settings that can be given in the configuration file but only a few are necessary for this example the rest have sensible defaults on masterhost  create a file named config with the following content cfgrole master cfghostname masterhost cfgknownhosts masterhost slavehost slavehost on slavehost  create a file named config with the following content cfgrole worker cfghostname slavehost cfgknownhosts masterhost slavehost slavehost on slavehost  create a file named config with the following content cfgrole worker cfghostname slavehost cfgknownhosts masterhost slavehost slavehost a brief discussion of these settings and what they mean the cfgrole setting determines the node s initial behavior this is a string which is used to differentiate the two kinds of nodes in this example more complex distributed systems might have more different kinds of roles in this case worker nodes do nothing on startup but just wait from a command from a master whereas master nodes seek out worker nodes and issue them commands the cfghostname setting indicates to each node the name of the host it s running on the cfgknownhosts setting provides a list of hosts that form part of this distributed execution this is necessary so that the master node can find its subservient slave nodes taken together these three settings tell each node a its own name b the names of other nodes and c their behavioral relationship  now run the pi program twice in each of the worker nodes there should now be four worker nodes awaiting instructions  to start the execution run pi on the master node you should see output like this        utc  pid and and masterhost  and  and say starting        utc  pid and and masterhost  and  and say telling slave nid and and slavehost  and to look at range          utc  pid and and masterhost  and  and say telling slave nid and and slavehost  and to look at range          utc  pid and and masterhost  and  and say telling slave nid and and slavehost  and to look at range          utc  pid and and masterhost  and  and say telling slave nid and and slavehost  and to look at range          utc  pid and and masterhost  and  and say done  let s talk about what s going on here this output is generated by the framework s logging facility each line of output has the following fields left to right the date and time that the log entry was generated the importance of the message in this case  the process id of the generating process the subsystem or component that generated this message in this case say indicates that these messages were output by a call to the say function and the body of the message from these messages we can see that the master node discovered four nodes running on two remote hosts for each of them the master emits a telling slave message note that although we had to specify the host names where the nodes were running in the config file the master found all nodes running on each of those hosts the log output also tells us which range of indices of the halton sequence were assigned to each node each slave having performed its calculation sends its results back to the master and when the master has received responses from all slaves it prints out its estimate of pi and ends the slave nodes continue running waiting for another request at this point we could run the master again or we can terminate the slaves manually with ctrl c or the kill command contributors  i am grateful for the contributions of the following people to this project alan mycroft andrew p

2324364, note this project is in maintenance mode bug fix only  i redirected my effort to jdbm which should provide better concurrent scalability jdbm provides treemap hashmap and other collections backed up by disk storage now you can handle billions of items without ever running out of memory jdbm is probably the fastest and the simpliest pure java database jdbm is tiny kb nodeps jar  but packed with features such as transactions instance cache and space efficient serialization it also has outstanding performance with  million inserts per second and  million fetches per second disk based it is tightly optimized and has minimal overhead it scales well from android phone to multi terrabyte data sets jdbm is opensource and free as beer under apache license there is no catch and no strings attached b tree with concurrentnavigablemap interface very fast for sequential read and write small values stored inside tree nodes small values stored inside tree nodes large values lazily fetched self balancing great performance even with e items delta compression on keys submaps aka cursors to view limited collection subsets custom comparators h tree with concurrentmap interface optimized for random reads and writes small values stored inside tree nodes large values lazily fetched self balancing great performance even with e items treeset and hashset which uses btree and htree without values linkedlist which implements bounded blockingdeque not implemented yet multi code scalability currently under testing everything is thread safe reads should scale linearly with number of cores as soon as it fits into cache all collection implements concurrent interfaces some multi core scalability with reentrantreadwritelock instance cache if data fits into cache reads are almost as fast as in memory collections minimal overhead works well even with mb heap scales well into gb ram heaps various yet simple tuning options transactions single transaction per store avoids concurrent modification stuff transactions are acid with limits for single concurrent transaction option to disable transactions for fast inserts and updates low level key value store various options for on disk store nio raf locking write performance not affected by store fragmentation in memory store option can read data from zip file with reasonable performance can read data from classpath resource database is deployable over java web start advanced defragmentation print store statistics transparent data encryption only  bytes overhead per record for example btree node space efficient serialization custom code for most java util and java lang classes for example long  takes only single byte very small pojo serialization overhead typically only  bytes per class and  byte for each field mimic java serialization fields can be transient  all classes needs to implement serializable interface supports externalizable possible to plug your own serializer performance blazing fast  million inserts and  million reads per second on my ghz machine but you should get  inserts p s easily tightly optimized code uses nio stuff you read about but never see in action minimal heap usage prevents java lang outofmemoryerror gc overhead limit most logic done with primitives or arrays minimal stack usage introduction  all classes are contained in package org apache jdbm there are only two important classes dbmaker is builder which configures and opens database db is database itself it opens collections and controls transactions collections in jdbm mimic their java util counter parts treemap uses an on disk ordered auto balanced b tree index linkedlist is stored as self referencing entries and so on everything should be thread safe currently under testing maven dependency  jdbm is not currently in any maven repository todo we should have soon custom repo with nightly builds quick example  import org apache jdbm and and open database using builder pattern and and all options are available with code autocompletion db db dbmaker openfile test deletefilesafterclose enableencryption password false make and and open an collection treemap has better performance then hashmap sortedmap integerstring map db createtreemap collectionname map put  one map put  two and and map keyset is now  even before commit db commit and and persist changes into disk map put  three and and map keyset is now  db rollback and and revert recent changes and and map keyset is now  db close a few quick tricks  disabling transaction increases write performance x do it by dbmaker disabletransactions do not forget to close store correctly in this case when transactions are enabled all uncommited instances are stored in memory make sure you commit on time it is most common cause of outofmemoryerror jdbm does not try to reclaim unused space after massive delete you must call db defrag false yourself treemap has usually better performance then hashmap jdbm uses instance cache with limited size by default if you have enought memory and large store use unbounded cache dbmaker enablehardcache jdbm is optimized for small size records sizes  bytes is recommended kb is reasonable maximum mb is hard limit jdbm scales well up to e records batch insert overnight creates multi terrabyte store collections  instance cache  jdbm caches created instances similar way as hibernate or other orm frameworks this greatly reduces serialization overhead and speedups database there are five cache types each configurable with method on dbmaker builder most recently used mru cache it is fixed size and stores newest entries this cache is on by default you can configure its size default size is  this cache has lowest gc overhead and may be suprisingly faster then other cache types no cache you may disable instance cache by using dbmaker disablecache hard reference cache all instances fetched by jdbm are stored in cache until released good with large memory heaps hard cache is recommended over soft and weak as it has smaller overhead use dbmaker enablehardcache to enable it weak reference cache instances are referenced using weakreference when item is no longer referenced by other instances it can be discarded by gc use dbmaker enableweakcache to enable it soft reference cache instances are referenced using softreference similar to weakreference but holds longer until systems starts running out of memory use dbmaker enablesoftcache to enable it with weak and soft and hard cache jdbm starts backround cleanup thread it also checks memory usage every  seconds if free memory is bellow   it clears cache our tests shows that gc is not fast enought to prevent outofmemoryerror this may be disabled with dbmaker disablecacheautoclear you may clear cache manually using db clearcache this is usefull after massive delete or when you are moving from one type of data to other transactions  jdbm supports single transaction per store it does not have multiple concurrent transactions with row and table locks pessimistic locking and similar stuff this trade off greatly simplifies design and speeds up operations transactions are still acid but in limited way transaction implementation is sound and solid uncommited data are stored in memory then during commit appended to end of transaction log file it is safe as append operation hardly ever corrupts file after commit is finished data are replayed from transaction log file into main storage file if users calls rollback transaction log file is discarded keeping transaction log file brings some overhead it is possible to disable transaction and write changes directly into main storage file it makes inserts and updates about x faster in this case no effort is made to protect file from corruption all is sacrificed for maximal speed it is absolutely necessary to properly close storage before exit you may disable transactions by using dbmaker disabletransactions uncommited instances are stored in memory and flushed to disk during commit so with large transactions you may run out of memory easily with disabled transactions data are stored in  mb memory buffer and flushed to main storage file when buffer is filled serialization  jdbm has its own space efficient serialization which tries to mimic standard implementation all classes must implement serializable interface you may exclude field from serialization by transient keyword our serialization also handles cyclic references and some other advanced stuff you may use your own binary format with externalizable interface or custom serializer jdbm has custom serialization code for most classes in java lang and java util packages for date jdbm writes only  bytes  byte long serialization header and  byte long timestamp for true  string or long  jdbm writes only single byte serialization header for array list and other collections jdbm writes serialization header packed size and data custom serializers have maximal space efficiency and low overhead standard java serialization stores class structure data field names types with record data this generates huge overhead which multiplies with number of records jdbm serialization stores class structure data in single space and record data only contains reference so space overhead for pojos is typically only  bytes per class and  byte for each field our serialization is designed to be very fast on small chunks of data a few pojos glued together with couple of thousands nodes in object tree it becomes slow n  scalability maximal record size in jdbm is  mb so it is good practise to store only small key and value in database you should always use filesystem for data larger then kb defragmentation  store gets fragmented jdbm is well designed so this does not slows down write and update and delete operations but fragmentation slows down read operations as more data needs to be readed from disk jdbm does not do any sort of magic to reclaim unused data it relies on user to call db defrag periodically or after massive update and delete and inserts defrag can be called at runtime but db defrag methods blocks other read and writes until it finishes defrag basically recreates copyes data from one store to second store then it deletes first store and renames second defragnentation has two modes controlled by db defrag boolean fulldefrag parameter quick defrag is designed to be as fast as possible it only reclaims unused space compacts store  but does not reorganize data inside store it copyes all data from one store to other without empty spaces between records it is very fast limited only by disk sequential write speed call it by db defrag false full defrag is designed to make store as fast as possible it reorganizes data layout so nodes from single collection are stored close to each other this makes future reads from store faster as less data needs to be read full defrag is much slower than quick defrag as it traverses and copies all collections unsequentially troubleshooting  jdbm uses chained exception so user does not have to write try catch blocks ioexception is usually wrapped in ioerror which is unchecked so please always check first exception outofmemoryerror jdbm keeps uncommited data in memory so you may need to commit more often if your memory is limited use mru cache on by default you may increase heap size by starting jvm with extra parameter xmxmb outofmemoryerror gc overhead limit exceeded your app is creating new object instances faster then gc can collect them when using soft and weak cache use hard cache to reduce gc overhead is auto cleared when free memory is low there is jvm parameter to disable this assertion file locking overlappingfilelockexception some ioerror you are trying to open file already opened by another jdbm make sure that you db close store correctly operating system may leave lock after jvm is terminated you may try dbmaker userandomaccessfile which is slower but does not use such aggressive locking in read only mode you can also open store multiple times you may also disable file locks completely by db disablefilelock at your own risk of course internalerror error assertionfailederror illegalargumentexception stackoverflowerror and so on there was an problem in jdbm it is possible that file store was corrupted thanks to an internal error or disk failure disabling cache by dbmaker disablecache may workaround the problem please submit bug report to github special thanks to ej technologies for donating us excellent

5295246, skypipe alpha  skypipe is a magical command line tool that lets you easily pipe data across terminal sessions regardless of whether the sessions are on the same machine across thousands of machines or even behind a firewall it gives you named pipes in the sky and lets you magically pipe data anywhere installing  currently you need python   zeromq   and and the ability to compile extensions then install with pip pip install skypipe setting up  the magic of skypipe requires a free dotcloud account if you don t have one you can easily create one for free the first time you use skypipe you will be asked for credentials using skypipe  skypipe combines named pipes and netcat and gives you even more power in a simpler tool here is a simple example using skypipe like you would a named pipe in order to gzip a file across shells skypipe and gzip  c out gz your skypipe is ready to receive some data from another shell process cat file and skypipe unliked named pipes however this will work across any machines connected to the internet and you didn t have to specify a host address or set up listen mode like you would with netcat in fact unlike netcat which is point to point you could use skypipe for log aggregation here we ll used named skypipes run this on several hosts tail f and var and log and somefile and skypipe logs and then run this on a single machine skypipe logs and var and log and aggregate or alternatively you can broadcast to multiple hosts with the above you can listen in by running this from your laptop even while behind a nat skypipe logs also unlike netcat you can temporarily store data in the pipe until you pull it out in fact you can keep several files in the pipe on one machine load some files into it a named skypipe cat filea and skypipe files cat fileb and skypipe files now from somewhere else pull them out in order skypipe files newfilea skypipe files newfileb lastly you can use skypipe like the channel primitive in go for coordinating between shell scripts as a simple example here we use skypipe to wait for an event triggered by another script and bin and bash echo i m going to wait until triggered skypipe trigger echo i was triggered triggering is just sending an eof over the pipe causing the listening skypipe to terminate we can do this with a simple idiom echo and skypipe trigger software with a service  the trick to this private pipe in the sky is that when you first use skypipe behind the scenes it will deploy a very simple messaging server to dotcloud skypipe will use your account to transparently find and use this server no matter where you are this all works without you ever thinking about it because this server is managed automatically and runs on dotcloud for free it might as well not exist this represents a new paradigm of creating tools that transparently leverage the cloud to create magical experiences it s not quite software as a service it s software with a service nobody is using a shared central service the software deploys its own service on your behalf for you to use thanks to platforms like dotcloud and heroku  we can now build software leveraging features of software as a service that is packaged and distributed like normal open source software contributing  there aren t any tests yet but it s pretty well documented and the code is written to be read fork and send pull requests check out the issues to see how you can be most helpful contributors

756184, the jlayout javascript library provides layout algorithms for laying out components a component is an abstraction it can be implemented in many ways for example as items in a html canvas drawing or as html elements the jlayout library allows you to focus on drawing the individual components instead of on how to arrange them on your screen the library currently provides four layout algorithms border  which lays out components in five different regions grid  which lays out components in a user defined grid flex grid which offers a grid with flexible column and row sizes and flow which flows components in a user defined direction using the grid and flex grid algorithms you can also create horizontal and vertical layouts a jquery plugin jquery plugin html to lay out html elements is also available we start with the definition of a component a component is something that has a minimum size a preferred size and a maximum size it also has a method to set its size and position a container is a component that contains other components and lays them out according to a layout algorithm which are provided in the jlayout library components need to satisfy the following interface requirements in order to be used with the layout algorithms dt bounds and dt dd returns the component s position and size as a value object with properties x  y  width and height all properties should be present in the returned object and dd dt bounds value and dt dd set the position and size of a component by using a value object with properties x  y  width and height the individual properties are all optional it is thus legal to supply an empty object or any combination of properties and dd dt preferredsize and dt dd returns the component s preferred size i e the size it wishes to have as an object with properties width and height this is only a hint there is no guarantee the component will get the size it prefers and dd dt minimumsize and dt dd returns the component s minimum size i e the size it should at least have as an object with properties width and height and dd dt maximumsize and dt dd returns the component s maximum size i e the size it should stay below or equal to as an object with properties width and height and dd dt isvisible and dt dd returns true if the component is visible and should be taken into account when calculating the layout returns false otherwise and dd dt insets and dt dd returns the offset between a container and its contents as an object with properties top  bottom  left  and right and dd dt dolayout and dt dd calls the layout method on the layout algorithm used to lay out the component container it is called on if the component is not a container and does not have a layout algorithm this method can be left empty and dd note that the distinction between containers and components is artificial both implement the same interface all algorithms are in the jlayout namespace and implement the following interface dt preferred container and dt dd returns the preferred size of the container and its children according to the layout algorithm and dd dt minimum container and dt dd returns the minimum size the container and its children are allowed to have according to the layout algorithm and dd dt maximum container and dt dd returns the maximum size the container and its children are allowed to have according to the layout algorithm and dd dt layout container and dt dd performs the layout according to the algorithm resizing and positioning children if necessary and dd the layout method will not resize the container to accommodate its children s preferred size if a resize is desired set the bounds of the container to its preferred size the example below shows both ways of laying out a container resizing the children to fit in the container and resizing the container to fit the children and and create a layout algorithm var mylayout  and and lay out without resizing the container mylayout layout container and and resize the container then lay it out container bounds mylayout preferred mylayout layout container a layout algorithm can be created by calling either the grid or border constructor in the jlayout namespace both constructors take an option object containing layout specific properties both layouts have the following properties in common dt hgap and dt dd the horizontal space between the laid out components should be a number in a coordinate space of your choice defaults to  optional and dd dt vgap and dt dd the vertical space between the laid out components should be a number in a coordinate space of your choice defaults to  optional and dd the other properties are specific to the layout algorithm and are discussed below the border algorithm lays out components in five different regions these regions are called center  north  south  east and west the center component will be laid out in the center of the container north on top of it south beneath it and west and east on the left and right side respectively the layout can only contain one of each region but all are optional below is a visualization of a layout using all five regions the border algorithm takes an option object as parameter which can contain the following properties dt center north south east west and dt dd the center north south east or west component all are optional and dd the following example lays out a west center and north component with a vertical space of  units between each component there may be additional space between the components and the container if the container returns non zero insets var borderlayout jlayout border west mywestcomponent center mycentercomponent north mynorthcomponent vgap  borderlayout layout mycontainer if a region is not specified or the component is not visible its space will be taken up by the other components the grid algorithm lays out the components in a grid and resizes each component to the same size the number of columns and rows can be specified by the user below is a visualization of a grid layout with four components in a x grid the grid algorithm takes an option object as parameter which can contain the following properties dt rows and dt dd the number of rows in the grid optional and dd dt columns and dt dd the number of columns in the grid optional and dd dt items and dt dd an array containing the components to be laid out by the algorithm optional and dd dt fill and dt dd the direction in which the grid is filled in valid values are horizontal or vertical for filling in the grid left to right and top to bottom or top to bottom and left to right respectivily optional and dd the following example lays out four components in a x grid without any spacing between the components var gridlayout jlayout grid rows  columns  items mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent gridlayout layout mycontainer if the number of rows is given the number of columns is calculated automatically by taking the number of components into account if the number of rows is not given or set to zero  and the number of columns is given the number of rows will be automatically calculated using the number of components if neither is given the number of rows is set equal to the number of components and the number of rows is set to zero the flex grid algorithm lays out the components in a grid with flexible row and columns sizes the number of columns and rows can be specified by the user below is a visualization of a flex grid layout with six components in a x grid the flex grid algorithm takes an option object as parameter which can contain the following properties dt rows and dt dd the number of rows in the flex grid optional and dd dt columns and dt dd the number of columns in the flex grid optional and dd dt items and dt dd an array containing the components to be laid out by the algorithm optional and dd the following example lays out six components in a x grid without any spacing between the components var flexgridlayout jlayout flexgrid rows  columns  items mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent flexgridlayout layout mycontainer if the number of rows is given the number of columns is calculated automatically by taking the number of components into account if the number of rows is not given or set to zero and the number of columns is given the number of rows will be automatically calculated using the number of components if neither is given the number of rows is set equal to the number of components and the number of rows is set to zero the flow algorithm lays out the components on a row when the component does not fit on the current row it is moved to the next row the alignment within the row can be user specified below is an example of a flow layout using five components with the alignment for each row set to left the flow algorithm takes an option object as parameter which can contain the following properties dt alignment and dt dd a string of either center  left  or right defaults to left and dd dt items and dt dd an array containing the components to be laid out by the algorithm optional and dd the following example lays out five components using a center alignment without any spacing between the components var flowlayout jlayout flow alignment center  items mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent flowlayout layout mycontainer horizontal and vertical layouts can be achieved by using a grid or a flexgrid layout with one row for horizontal layouts and one column for vertical layouts the choice of a grid layout or a flexgrid layout depends on whether or not you want the items in the grid to have uniform sizes grid or their natural sizes flexgrid the following layout uses a flex grid so that all items are laid out in the horizontal direction while still allowing the individual items to take up their natural size i e the second component is longer than the other two var horizontallayout jlayout flexgrid rows  items mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent you can also lay out components vertically by just changing the rows parameter to columns as shown in the next example var verticallayout jlayout flexgrid columns  items mycomponent mycomponent mycomponent this libary and the jquery plugin are licensed under the library is completely free for

2273305, automated browser testing via phantom js with all of the pain taken out that means you get a real browser  with a real dom  and can do real testing to install first gem install ghostbuster once you ve done that you can run setup ghostbuster right now this only works on mac so otherwise ghostbuster will look for a copy of the phantomjs binary in and ghostbuster once installed you can simply use ghostbuster path and to and ghostfile to run your tests as well you can install ghostbuster to run as a rake task to do this add this to your rakefile require ghostbuster and installrake your ghostfile handles your configuration to set the pattern use ghost pattern test jscoffee this is the default to enable or disable screenshots use ghost takescreenshots or donottakescreenshots defaults to takescreenshots to set the directory your screenshots will save to use ghost screenshotdir to set the dimensions for the screenshots use ghost screenshotdimensions   width height to set the command for starting your server use ghost startcommand and start sh to set the timeout in seconds for the startcommand to complete use ghost startwait  this is the default to set the command for stopping your server use ghost stopcommand and stop sh to set the location of your phantomjs binary use ghost phantombin file join env home  ghostbuster  phantomjs if no ghostfile is found it will simply use the defaults you should get some output that looks something like this ghostbuster for and users and joshbuddy and development and ghostbuster and ghost and testghost coffee  simple index  form input  link traversal  bad link traversal  form input not equal assert first for selector out did not meet expectations for and users and joshbuddy and development and ghostbuster and ghost and testghostmore coffee  simple form  form should do more things your test directory should look something like this ghosttests and start sh used to start your web application ghosttests and stop sh used to stop your web application ghosttests and test coffee your tests look inside ghost to see some examples of what actual tests would look like let s dive into a couple of simple examples here is one in coffeescript phantom test add simple index  this adds a test get and  this will get your a path relative to your root body assertfirst p  p this asserts the first paragraph s inner text p innerhtml this is my paragraph is this is my paragraph body assertall ul li  li idx li innerhtml list item idx and  succeed all tests must succeed here is the same test in javascript phantom test add simple index  function and and this adds a test this get and  function and and this will get your a path relative to your root and and this asserts the first paragraph s inner text this body assertfirst p  function p return p innerhtml this is my paragraph and and this asserts all li s have the test list item num this body assertall ul li  function li idx return li innerhtml list item and idx and  this succeed  the following methods are available within your test arguments location options  callback this location will be relative to your root if it doesn t start with http your callback will be called when the document is ready arguments selector index this will click the nth element matching the selector if no index is specified it uses the first one found arguments selector index or options this will click the nth element matching the selector and assert the location changed if no index is specified it uses the first one found if no path option is given it will merely assert that the location changed arguments selector text this will fill in the matching form elements with the text given arguments selector newvalue this will set a select box to a given value arguments seconds callback this will wait seconds secs and then call your callback assertions are run in order and only one assertion at a time can run an assertion will have at most one second to complete if you want to change the total amount of time an assertion will take you can supply that time body assertfirst p  total  p this asserts the first paragraph s inner text the options for all assertions currently accepts total  which is the total amount of time this assertion will run for in seconds the available assertion function are available on body arguments selector options  callback the callback will be called with the first matching dom element for the selector the callback must return true if this assertion is met arguments selector options  callback the callback will be called for each matching dom element for the selector the arguments supplied to the callback is the dom element and the index starting at  the callback must return true if this assertion is met arguments location options this assertion will attempt to match the current browser location if your location does not start with http  it will be considered relative to the root of your test arguments location options this assertion will attempt to refute the current browser location if your location does not start with http  it will be considered relative to the root of your test arguments selector options  callback this callback will be called with the number of matching dom elements for this selector the callback must return true if this assertion is met arguments selector count options  callback the callback will be called for each matching dom element for the selector it will only be called if the number of matching elements is equal to count the arguments supplied to the callback is the dom element and the index starting at  the callback must return true if this assertion is met you can add an arbitrary number of before and after blocks to be run within the context of your test simply call before and after on your test to add them you have to call succeed in the before block to continue processing your test phantom test before do some setup succeed phantom test after do some teardown
1061668, formerly clrzmq legacy bindings have moved to clrzmq old clrzmq old this project aims to provide the full functionality of the underlying zeromq api to clr projects bundled libzmq version    rc legacy libzmq version supported    stable the quickest way to get started with clrzmq is by using the nuget package clrzmq nuget the nuget packages include a copy of the native libzmq dll which is required to use clrzmq you may also build clrzmq directly from the source see the development environment setup instructions below for more detail to get an idea of how to use clrzmq have a look at the following example using system using system text using system threading using zmq namespace zmqguide class program static void main string args  and and zmq context server socket using zmqcontext context zmqcontext create using zmqsocket server context createsocket sockettype rep  server bind tcp and and   while true  and and wait for next request from client string message server receive encoding unicode console writeline received request   message and and do some work thread sleep  and and send reply back to client server send world  encoding unicode    using system using system text using zmq namespace zmqguide class program static void main string args  and and zmq context and client socket using zmqcontext context zmqcontext create using zmqsocket client context createsocket sockettype req  client connect tcp and and localhost  string request hello for int requestnum  requestnum  requestnum and and  console writeline sending request   requestnum client send request encoding unicode string reply client receive encoding unicode console writeline received reply    requestnum reply    for more information about mq and clrzmq see the following resources the mq guide zmq guide is a thorough overview of mq and contains example code for most supported languages including c examples are stored in a github repository zmq example repo more tutorials and api documentation are on the way when using a packaged nuget and zip release on windows clrzmq comes bundled with  and  bit versions of libzmq dll that have been fully tested with the binding package the dlls are embedded as manifest resources in the assembly and are extracted when initially loading the assembly to accommodate different deployment needs several output paths may be used the libzmq dll search and extract order is as follows  libzmq dll on system path allows loading a custom libzmq dll into system path  etc see loadlibrary load library for search order  extract to assembly path full path to the currently executing clrzmq dll  extract to execution path full path to the executable calling clrzmq  extract to temporary path current user s temp clrzmq x x x x last ditch fallback only severly restricted accounts will fail to extract to this path if you run into problems related to loading the native library you can enable tracing in your application as follows  configure the clrzmq trace switch to use the info level  configuration system diagnostics switches and switches and system diagnostics and configuration iis deployments can be complicated due to the many possible identities and privilege levels that may be executing your application there are a few steps you can take to ensure the bundled native libraries can be properly extracted and used  at the bare minimum ensure the application pool identity has write access to its temp folder  allow write access to your application s bin directory i e  the directory containing clrzmq dll and your application assemblies  if none of those options are suitable you will need to obtain a compiled version of libzmq dll for your platform and extract it to a system path see loadlibrary load library for candidates on windows and net clrzmq is developed with visual studio  mono development is done with monodevelop   and clrzmq depends on libzmq dll  which will be retrieved automatically via nuget if you require a specific version of libzmq you can compile it from the mq sources libzmq  clone the source  run build cmd to build the project and run the test suite  the resulting binaries will be available in and build if you want to use a custom build of libzmq dll  perform the following steps  delete or rename the src and nuget and packages config file this prevent the nuget package from being retrieved  remove any folders matching src and packages and libzmq that may have been downloaded previously  copy the  bit and  bit if applicable build of libzmq dll to lib and x and lib and x  respectively note that pgm related tests will fail if a non pgm build of libzmq is used note mono    and is required for development only  as the nuget scripts and executables require this version to be present if you choose to install dependencies manually you may use any version of mono   and nuget relies on several certificates to be registered with mono the following is an example terminal session on ubuntu for setting this up correctly this assumes you have already installed mono    or higher mozroots import sync this should result in a working mono setup for use with nuget either clone the zeromq repository libzmq or download the sources zmq dl  and then follow the build and install instructions for your platform use the with pgm option if possible  clone the source  run nuget sh  which downloads any dependent packages e g  nunitlite for acceptance tests  run make to build the project and run the test suite  the resulting binaries will be available in and build note clrzmq only supports x builds on mono at this time issues should be logged on the github issue tracker issues for this project when reporting issues please include the following information if possible version of clrzmq and and or how it was obtained compiled from source nuget package version of libzmq being used runtime environment net and mono and associated version operating system and platform win and  bit linux and  bit code snippet demonstrating the failure pull requests and patches are always appreciated to speed up the merge process please follow the guidelines below when making a pull request create a new branch in your fork for the changes you intend to make working directly in master can often lead to unintended additions to the pull request later on when appropriate add to the acceptancetests project to cover any new functionality or defect fixes ensure all previous tests continue to pass with exceptions for pgm tests follow the code style used in the rest of the project resharper and stylecop configurations have been included in the source tree pull requests will still be accepted if some of these guidelines are not followed changes will just take longer to merge as the missing pieces will need to be filled in this project is released under the lgpl lgpl license as is the native libzmq library see license for more details as well as the mq licensing zmq license

801991, ssu is a scripted web site navigator scraper it was originally designed and conceived as part of wesabe s infrastructure and has since been open sourced its original design goal was to extract ofx ofx data given bank usernames and passwords for use on wesabe com the system it uses to get this data is xulrunner xulrunner  a project from mozilla that provides a customizable and scriptable browser ssu has scripts for each financial institution it supports that describes how to log in and download data from that institution s web site it was originally written in javascript but is currently mostly coffeescript coffeescript you can write bank scripts in either language though coffeescript will be the preferred one going forward why would i use this  if you re trying to aggregate transaction data from multiple financial institutions possibly for a large number of people then this project might be useful to you how do i try this out  first clone the ssu repo the easiest way to try this is on your laptop and desktop computer running linux or mac os x windows isn t supported ssu comes with a bunch of scripts for financial institutions that it already supports your initial experience trying out ssu is going to be much easier if you have an account at one of these institutions to check go to the fi scripts fi scripts folder and start looking for your bank let s say your bank is chase whose site is chase com we store the scripts for financial institutions in a reverse dns folder structure so you need to look in the com directory for the chase coffee script if your financial institution is supported then great next you ll need to install xulrunner if you re on linux you ll want to use your package manager e g apt get if you re on os x you can use the bundled setup script ssu and bootstrap that ll install it if it s not installed and tell you the version you have installed if it is already now go ahead and start the app itself in a terminal window ssu bin and server you ll see some logging output along with some startup messages and a blank browser window titled wesabe desktopuploader as long as you don t see any errors you should be good to go next you can generate a credentials file to test with again let s assume you have an account at chase in another terminal window run this ssu bundle ssu bundle exec script and generate credential com chase chase that ll create a file at credentials and chase that looks like this creds username fiusername  password fipassword  fid com chase just change fiusername and fipassword to your username and password for chase and save the file now fire up the test client and start a job ssu script and console job job create chase your first terminal window and the blank browser should now be doing something ideally logging into your financial institution site and getting your recent transaction data if it succeeds it ll store the downloaded statement s in the app s profile directory you can get a list like so from the console list statement all statement xf id ded dccd  ffff fffffffff list first read ofxheader  r n congrats you ve successfully gotten data out of your financial institution s website so how do i use this for real  the original application that used ssu is the one ssu was written for at wesabe pfc pfc you can see how to manage ssu in this file that controls the ssu process daemon and this file that talks to it syncjob basically ssu sets up a tiny http server at port  by default for commands here s a request to list all the statements that have been downloaded post and legacy http and   action statement list here s one that starts a job with credentials post and legacy http and   content type application and json content length  action job start  body fid com ingdirect  creds username joesmith  password iamgod responses will be in json regardless of what accept header you pass a successful response to the and statements request http and    ok content type application and json status ok  statements daa dd  dff ebcd an example error response status error  error referenceerror foo is not defined note the and legacy route is a temporary compatibility measure with the old pure socket way of communicating with ssu eventually it ll be replaced by rest based routes e g get and statements  post and jobs  etc you can use any programming language you like that supports spawning processes and http to manage an ssu instance this project ships with development tools that also serve as basic examples in the server server spawning and console console communication managing via api rb api rb scripts my bank isn t supported can i add it  yep there s a generator for that which will build a skeleton script for your financial insitution ssu bundle generating with player generator added application and chrome and content and wesabe and fi scripts and com and ally coffee added application and chrome and content and wesabe and fi scripts and com and ally and login coffee added application and chrome and content and wesabe and fi scripts and com and ally and accounts coffee you can probably leave the base script ally coffee in this example alone and start filling in login coffee with the info required to navigate the site once you ve added something and created a matching credential file go ahead and try it out ssu script and console job start ally there are lots of examples in the fi scripts directory for you to reference as you build your own script once you re satisfied just commit your files and send a pull request so we can add your financial institution for others to use why use a browser  using xulrunner means that ssu can access any bank site that firefox can so you don t have to use mechanize or some other tool that

4010984, earthview d globe visualization for ios  earthview is an open source d visualization of the earth globe for ios that uses map tiles for imagery and opengl es and glkit for rendering i built it for a side project that may never go anywhere so i figured it might be educational or useful to other developers the project uses a quad tree to page in map tiles that conform to the tile map service standard or the flipped google equivalent the level of detail to display is determined by the estimated screen space error of a given page how to use  move the globe around by dragging with your finger you can flick the globe to spin it further zoom in and out using a pinch gesture or by double tapping tilt or rotate the globe by dragging a finger along the right or bottom edges of the screen respectively there is currently no way to select which map layer is displayed at runtime see drappdelegate m to select which hardcoded layer is used about the author  i build advanced airborne d imagers at my day job which leaves me with the creative itch to build something a bit more tactile in my free time feel free to contact me ross w anderson gmail com or rossanderson if you have questions comments or an interesting business opportunity let me know if you use earthview in your app the overall license for this project is bsd tppropertyanimation by michael tyson is also bsd licensed and is included in the source folder please see the license file for specific rights and restrictions requirements and dependancies  this project has no dependencies beyond the ios  sdk it has been tested to work correctly on an ipad rd generation and iphone  the example application connects to various map tile services over the web such as mapbox or opensteetmap as defined in drappdelegate m there is no local data stored with the application so an internet connection on your device is required bugs limitations and todos  the terrain data appears to be mis aligned to the map the derived bounding spheres don t appear to be calculated correctly there are holes in the globe at the poles because there is no map tile content there the tilt control should bounce when you hit the hard stops the star box should fade into a blue sky box as the user zooms the camera in

5546860, i m not aware of folks having published their code for the netflix prize here s mine under the team name hi  i competed alone in college i did it mostly for fun and to learn modern machine learning techniques it was an incredibly valuable but strenuous time well worth it on all fronts though i peaked out at  or so and then dropped out to work on my senior thesis and came in  or so what i learned in the process was that smarter wasn t always better make an algorithm and then scale it up and then make a dozen tweaks to it and then average all of the results together that s how you climbed the leaderboard anyhoo i haven t touched this code in awhile but perhaps it ll be useful to folks interested in competitive data mining specifically the lessons i learned get the raw data into a saved and manageable format fast the easier it is to load your data in and start mutating it the better if doing simple pivots on your data is hard and slows you down from visualizing whats in your data spend time making data structures which make that easy generalize iterate if you have a method you think will work but it has a lot of knobs and you don t know the best way to set those knobs make it easy for you to try every possible iteration there is often not a good way to figure out what the best approach is you will have to try many of them in order to build up an intuition specifically that means for me a pluggable architecture if there s ten ways to try a particular step make sure you write your overarching algorithm so that it takes a function that you can pass to it as opposed to having a method hardwired in the code that way you can hotswap all your ideas speed is a feature of course you make sure it works first but your goal is to see if something works if an algorithm takes a day to run but you can spend five hours making it run in  and  of a day do it you ll be running it over and over again and you ll learn more if you can iterate the original data is gone i believe but i might have it stored somewhere i ll look for that

4715434, uiresponder and keyboardcache  there is a small problem in ios that causes a pretty significant delay between the first time the keyboard is requested and when it actually appears it is only the first time and seems to be related to the os trying to cache various properties of the keyboard on my iphone s running ios   as of june th  it can take anywhere between  and  seconds it can create a frustrating user experience and most users will try to tap the activation area multiple times sometimes leading to accidental dismissal of the keyboard this category on uiresponder gives you a simple method and cachekeyboard so that you can control when this caching work is done for example if you are loading some data from a server then you could invoke this during that downtime there is another method and cachekeyboard that takes an optional bool value passing yes to this method causes the cache invocation to happen on the next runloop so if you performed an animation just before calling this method it would not interrupt that animation brandon williams uiresponder and keyboardcache is available under the mit license see the license file for more info

3163719, cassie is a small lightweight cassandra client built on encoding and decoding it is heavily used in production at twitter so such be considered stable yet it is incomplete in that it doesn t support the full feature set of cassandra and will continue to evolve requirements  java se  scala   cassandra   or later sbt   note that cassie is usable from java its not super easy but we re working to make it easier let s get this party started  file add cassie as a dependency val cassie com twitter cassie    before going further you should probably learn about finagle and its paradigm for asynchronous connecting to your cassandra cluster  first create a cluster object passing in a list of seed hosts by default when creating a connection to a keyspace the given hosts will be queried for a full list of nodes in the cluster if you don t want to report stats use nullstatsreceiver val cluster new cluster hosthost  ostrichstatsreceiver then create a keyspace instance which will use finagle to maintain per node connection pools and do retries val keyspace cluster keyspace mycassieapp connect and and see keyspacebuilder for more options here try the defaults first if you have some nodes with dramatically different latency e g  in another data center or if you have a huge cluster you can disable keyspace mapping via maphostsevery  minutes in which case clients will connect directly to the seed hosts passed to new cluster a quick note on timestamps  cassandra uses client generated timestamps to determine the order in which writes and deletes should be processed cassie previously came with several different clock implementations now all cassie users use the microsecondepochclock and timestamps should be mostly hidden from users a longer note this time on column names and values  cassandra stores the name and value of a column as an array of bytes to convert these bytes to and from useful scala types cassie uses codec parameters for the given type for example take adding a column to a column family of utf  strings val strings keyspace columnfamily utfcodec utfcodec utfcodec strings insert newstring  column colname  colvalue the insert method here requires a string and column string string because the type parameters of the columnfamily call were all codec string the conversion between strings and bytearrays will be seamless cassie has codecs for a number of data types already utfcodec character sequence encoded with utf  intcodec  bit integer stored as a  byte sequence longcodec  bit integer stored as an  byte sequence lexicaluuidcodec a uuid stored as a  byte sequence thriftcodec a thrift struct stored as variable length sequence of bytes accessing column families  once you ve got a keyspace instance you can load your column families val people keyspace columnfamily utfcodec utfcodec utfcodec people val numbers keyspace columnfamily utfcodec utfcodec intcodec people  defaultreadconsistency readconsistency one defaultwriteconsistency writeconsistency any by default columnfamily instances have a default readconsistency and writeconsistency of quorum  meaning reads and writes will only be considered successful if a quorum of the replicas for that key respond successfully you can change this default or simply pass a different consistency level to specific read and write operations reading data from cassandra  now that you ve got your columnfamily  you can read some data from cassandra people getcolumn codahale  name getcolumn returns an future option column name value where name and value are the type parameters of the columnfamily if the row or column doesn t exist none is returned explaining futures is out of scope for this readme go the finagle docs to learn more but in essence you can people getcolumn codahale  name map  match case col some column string string we have data case none there was no column handle case e there was an exception do something about it this whole block returns a future which will be satisfied when the thrift rpc is done and the callbacks have run anyway continuing you can also get a set of columns people getcolumns codahale  set name  motto this returns a future java util map name column name value  where each column is mapped by its name if you want to get all columns of a row that s cool too people getrow codahale cassie also supports multiget for columns and sets of columns people multigetcolumn set codahale  darlingnikles  name people multigetcolumns set codahale  darlingnikles  set name  motto multigetcolumn returns a future map key map name column name value whichmaps row keys to column names to columns asynchronous iteration through rows and columns  note this is new and experimental and likely to change in the future cassie provides functionality for iterating through the rows of a column family and columns in a row this works with both the random partitioner and the order preserving partitioner though iterating through rows in the random partitioner had undefined order you can iterate over every column of every row val finished cf rowsiteratee  foreach case key columns println key and and this function is executed async for each row println cols finished and and this is a future unit wait on it to know when the iteration is done this gets  rows at a time and calls the above partial function on each one writing data to cassandra  inserting columns is pretty easy people insert codahale  column name  coda people insert codahale  column motto  moar lean you can insert a value with a specific timestamp people insert darlingnikles  column name  niki timestamp l people insert darlingnikles  column motto  told ya timestamp l batch operations are also possible people batch cf cf insert puddle  column name  puddle cf insert puddle  column motto  food execute see batchmutationbuilder for a better idea of which operations are available deleting data from cassandra  first it s important to understand in a distributed system like cassandra once you ve read that then feel free to remove a column people removecolumn puddle  name or a set of columns people removecolumns puddle  set name  motto or even a row people removerow puddle generating unique ids  if you re going to be storing data in cassandra and don t have a naturally unique piece of data to use as a key you ve probably looked into uuids the only problem with uuids is that they re mental requiring access to mac addresses or gregorian calendars or posix ids in general people want uuids which are unique across a large set of workers without requiring coordination partially ordered by time cassie s lexicaluuid s meet these criteria they re  bits long the most significant  bits are a timestamp value from cassie s strictly increasing clock implementation the least significant  bits are a worker id with the default value being a hash of the machine s hostname when sorted using cassandra s lexicaluuidtype  lexicaluuid s will be partially ordered by time that is uuids generated in order on a single process will be totally ordered by time uuids generated simultaneously i e  within the same clock tick given clock skew will not have a deterministic order uuids generated in order between single processes i e  in different clock ticks given clock skew will be totally ordered by time see lamport time clocks and the ordering of events

107201, laterdude  laterdude is a small calendar helper plugin for rails with in support where the calendarhelper had one helper method that internally called multiple other private methods laterdude keeps the namespace clean by tucking away all of its functionality in a presenter of sorts most css class names are given implictly e g day  weekendday both are given to the displayed month as well as to the previous and following month  othermonth all days that don t belong to the displayed month and today the only css class that can be configured is the table s class which defaults to calendar further customization can be taken care of by passing a block see examples installation  you can use laterdude either as a gem preferred or as a rails plugin to use the gem version put the following gem requirement in your environment rb or with rails  add the gem requirement to your gemfile gem laterdude        was broken to install it as a plugin fire up your terminal go to your rails app and type ruby script and plugin install git and and github com and clemens and laterdude git to use the calendarhelper put this in a controller helper laterdude calendarhelper there are two basic ways of outputting a calendar via the presenter itself or by using the helper method calendarfor   and laterdude calendar new   tohtml both yield the same results this is similar to what rails does with redcloth and bluecloth filters in addition to year and month which are required parameters you can optionally supply an options hash calendarfor   calendarclass mycalendar  firstdayofweek  possible options are calendarclass the css class for the surrounding table defaults to calendar firstdayofweek the first day of the week  sunday  monday etc defaults to the date firstdayofweek translation in the respective locale or  if no translation can be found hidedaynames hide the table header showing day names defaults to false hidemonthname hide the table header showing the month name defaults to false usefulldaynames use full instead of abbreviated day names defaults to false usefullmonthnames use full instead of abbreviated month names defaults to true yieldsurroundingdays defines whether or not days or the previous and next month are yielded to the passed block defaults to false nextmonth defines if and how the next month should be displayed see section formatting the header section for

the next and previous month should be displayed see section formatting the header section for further information currentmonth defines how the current month should be displayed see section formatting the header section for further information you can also pass in a block to mark days according to your own set of rules the block gets passed each day of the current month i e days of the previous and following month are not yielded calendarfor   do and day and if calendar haseventson day linkto day day eventspath day year day month day day  class daywithevents else day day end end the block can either return an array containing two elements or a single value if an array is returned the first element will be the content of the table cell and the second will be used as html options for the table cell tag if a single value is returned it will be used as the content of the table cell hint you can avoid cluttering up your views and move the block to a helper app and helpers and calendarhelper rb def calendareventsproc lambda do and day and if calendar haseventson day linkto day day eventspath day year day month day day  class daywithevents else day day end end app and views and calendar and show html calendarfor   calendareventsproc formatting the header section  you can customize the calendar s header section i e the first table row by using one or more of the following options nextmonth previousmonth nextandpreviousmonth currentmonth all of these can either take a single value or an array of two values simple string nextmonth raquo strftime string nextmonth b proc will evaluate the proc nextmonth lambda and date and linkto raquo  calendarpath date year month year simple string and proc will evaluate the proc and use it for linkto e g linkto raquo  calendarpath

month year nextmonth b  lambda and date and calendarpath date year month year if you use a proc it gets passed a date object carrying the respective month i e the proc for previousmonth gets passed a date object representing the previous month etc you can do all kinds of mighty stuff with a proc imagine a situation where you want to show the abbreviated month name and then the number of events for the given month nextmonth lambda and date and linkto in localize date format b pluralize event inmonth date  calendarpath date year date month the option nextandpreviousmonth can be used as a shortcut if you want to use the same formatting for the next and previous month both nextmonth and previousmonth override the nextandpreviousmonth if given you can define the following keys in your locale files to customize output date formats calendarheader defines the date format to be used for the table header date firstdayofweek defines the first day of a week  sunday  monday etc of course you can also put other configuration options in the locale and then pass them in manually somewhere in a locale date calendar calendarclass mycoolcalendar in the view calendarfor   calendarclass in translate

2864256,  many programming languages e g ruby python lisp conceptualize a reusable self contained unit of work to simplify context and scope in these languages they are called closures or lambdas since os x   and ios   objective c as well as c and c and and developers have their own blocks an even more valuable advantage of blocks over other forms of callback is that a block shares data in the local lexical scope if you implement a method and in that method define a block the block has access to the local variables and parameters of the method including stack variables as well as to functions and global variables including instance variables there are many places in objective c where blocks make more sense than methods for delegation or simplistic function like callbacks while apple is slowly migrating toward block callbacks at the typically glacial pace of os frameworks  adynamicdelegate serves to help bridge this gap by dynamically implementing protocol methods with blocks and creating block properties that do the same for the same reason that blocks are better than functions because they can take advantage of its declaring scope a dynamic block implemented delegate is better than a normal delegate instead of having to set an instance or static variable for every piece of data that you want to pass between a creating a delegating object and receiving delegate methods you can access them directly from the block adynamicdelegate implement a class s delegate datasource or other delegated protocol by associating protocol methods with block implementations ablockdelegate create custom block properties in a category on a delegating object and dynamically map them to delegate uialertviewdelegate  datasource uitableviewdatasource  or other delegated protocol nserrorrecoveryattempting methods for the sake of convenience you can either build the ios library target or download a binary release and use the libadynamicdelegate a static library in place of the  m source files this is useful for projects that use arc because adynamicdelegate does not support it see below  copy the included files to your xcode project  implement protocol methods with blocks  optional look at how much simpler your code is implement a class s delegate datasource or other delegated protocol by associating protocol methods with block implementations to get the dynamic delegate for an object use one of the three getters defined in nsobject adynamicdelegate dynamicdatasource assumes protocol foobardatasource for instances of class foobar dynamicdelegate assumes protocol foobardelegate for instances of class foobar dynamicdelegateforprotocol receives protocol explicitly calling one of the above methods allows us to storing the dynamic delegate as an associated object of the delegating object this not only allows us to later retrieve the delegate but it also creates a strong relationship to the delegate since delegates are weak references on the part of the delegating object a dynamic delegate would be deallocated immediately after its declaring scope ends therefore this strong relationship is required to ensure that the delegate s lifetime is at least as long as that of the delegating object a dynamic delegate instance automatically implements protocol methods using the following methods implementmethod withblock implement a protocol method blockimplementationformethod get block implementation can also be used to check if method has block implementation removeblockimplementationformethod remove block

728723, jquery combinators the jquery plugin with the academic name and the pragmatic methods jquery combinators adds five very useful methods to every jquery object tap  into  select  ergo and when these allow you to use your own functions as if they were built in jquery methods which makes your code cleaner and more jquery like all five methods are documented in full but here s a cheat sheet given that is a jquery selection of some kind and given that fn is a function taking a jquery selection as an argument tap executes the function for side effects then returns the original selection this is useful for making your own jquery methods that chain fluently tap fn fn return into returns the result of the function this is useful for making your own jquery traverses or inspectors that act like size and attr into fn return fn select returns the result of the function just like into  however it preserves the atomicity of filters this is useful for making complex filter functions because they work as expected when you use end select fn return fn ergo always return the selection it will execute the function if the selection is not empty this is useful for eliminating selection checks in methods ergo fn if length fn return when executes the function and returns the original selection if the function returned truthy otherwise it returns an empty selection this is useful for refactoring if statements into chaining jquery methods when fn if fn return filter else return filter not it s common to want to perform a series of operations on a selection jquery has many built in methods that always return their receiver to facilitate this kind of programming you can make your own methods that return the selection with tap it turns any function into a jquery style fluent function that returns its argument for example  tap function bar  return blitz and and passes to the function and always returns and not blitz here s a real example from a go program go the sample code calculates how many white and black stones have been captured then uses tap to call a function that updates a display element var incrementcaptureddisplay function capturedstones colour and and board find map thismove k split   and  lambda join  filter white tap incrementcaptureddisplay white removeclass white addclass changed waswhite end filter black tap incrementcaptureddisplay black removeclass black addclass changed wasblack end we could have used into to make this code clean but then we d have to fiddle around with our functions to make sure they return their receiver with tap  we are sure that we will get self back whether the function returns something else or even nothing at all also did you notice that we passed the function and another parameter to tap with all of jquery combinators extra parameters will be passed to the function along with the selection functional programmers will tell you that this isn t strictly necessary however curry isn t to everybody s taste into is a method that works with any jquery object you pass a function to into  and into passes its receiver to the function and returns whatever the function returns in other words into turns any function including an anonymous function into your own jquery method into also handy in oo languages like ruby when you want to make chains of function calls into a chain of methods since jquery s style is to prefer chains of methods into is a natural fit with jquery for example you might have a function that turns a jquery selection into a selector string that selects the elements by id var selectors function selection return map selection function el return and el id join  with into  you can use that anywhere you like in jquery style  into selectors and and returns a selector string now your function works just like one of jquery s built in methods you can do this with any function that takes a jquery object as its parameter even an anonymous function into is especially useful with functions that transform one selection into another this is equivalent to adding your own dom traverses to jquery jquery s built in traverses like closest or siblings are all general purpose but your specific web application will probably need its own domain specific traverses in the game go go  it is very common to want to find the intersections that are adjacent to some set of intersections on the board the intersections are arranged in rows so while previous and next an find adjacent intersections in the same row you need something else to find the intersections above and below an intersection furthermore go s rules often require working with the intersections that are adjacent to a group of intersections on the board without boring you with the exact code let s assume you write a function to find the intersections adjacent to a selection of intersections var adjacent function selectionofintersections return adjacentintersections now you can use adjacent just like any other jquery traversal  into adjacent and and returns a selection of adjacent intersections in summary into lets you write your own jquery methods on the fly without having to inject them into the global namespace as your own plugin this encourages you to write your code in jquery style jquery s built in selection filters do clever things with a stack so that you can always call end to restore the previous selection into does no such thing although any find or filter you call inside of into will work with jquery s built in stack for creating your own filters jquery combinators provides select it always preserves the previous state of the filter stack in go it s common to want to find the empty intersections within a selection this code is short enough to repeat here var empties function intersections return intersections filter intersection not black not white you can use empties just like a jquery filter  select empties and and returns a selection of empty intersections or combine a traverse with a filter to find the number of liberties empty adjacent intersections  into adjacent select empties ruby programmers are familiar with andand andand and the closely related try try these allow for conditional method invocation in ruby you sometimes want to invoke a method provided the receiver is not null this is important because most methods raise an exception when invoked on a null object if you use andand or try  you can send a method to an object and nothing happens if it s null jquery s built in methods already work like this if you have an empty selection you can invoke all kinds of jquery methods on it and nothing happens if your selection is empty for example abcxyz addclass fubar does absolutely nothing if you don t have any elements of class abcxyz that s great and it keeps jquery code clean you don t have to litter jquery code with if selection length checks everywhere but what about methods you create with tap if all they do is call jquery s built in methods they will work just fine but once in a while you might write a function containing some code that you don t want executed on an empty selection for example var updatedkilledcount function killedstones and and and and some code updating a counter on the board and and alert congratulations you have killed and killedstones and stone s this won t work very well if there are no killed stones with tap  you would have to wrap your function call in a conditional to avoid an embarrassment board find killed tap function killedstones if killedstones length updatedkilledcount killedstones  removeclass black white this comes up so often jquery combinators provides a special form of tap called ergo that bakes the selection check right in board find killed ergo updatedkilledcount removeclass black white like tap  ergo always returns its receiver the difference is that ergo only invokes the function if the selection isn t empty getting rid of the conditional makes the code much cleaner and it saves you from having to add conditional checks to your functions there s another more subtle benefit if you use jquery combinator with oliver steele s excellent functional javascript fj  you already can use string lambdas as well as functions for example you can write t attr id instead of t function el return el attr id the limitation of string lambdas is that they work with functions that are expressions you can t write tap if  length alert congratulations you killed and  length and stones but you can write ergo alert congratulations you killed and  length and stones aha once you start using into  it ll only be a matter of time before you look at code like this var group board find if group into liberties length  group removeclass dead addclass atari and wonder whether there s some way to get rid of the clumsy if statement so that everything can chain in fluent jquery style you could do something by stuffing the if inside of a function with into  but the cure would be worse than the disease but do something with a selection when such and such an expression is truthy is common enough that jquery combinators provides a method for this special case called when when is a special filter that passes your selection to a function if the function returns truthy when keeps your selection if the function returns falsy when reduces the selection to an empty selection so the code above could be written like this board find when function group return group into liberties length  removeclass dead addclass atari when is really handy with string lambdas for example here s how to mark the intersection that would kill a group in atari board find into liberties when length  addclass killsagroup  this code finds a group uses adjacent and empties to traverse to the adjacent empty intersections then passes that selection along to add the class killsagroup if its length is one when can be combined with ergo to replace complex if statements with chains of method calls in jquery style why is this plugin called jquery combinators into is known in some cs circles as the thrush t or t combinator for that reason you can also write t instead of into with jquery combinators both into and t work and both are acceptable prefer into if you like a conversational program that will be familiar to ruby programmers prefer t if you and your team are comfortable with the more brief academic terminology neither is superior to the other t is not a snobbish intellectually violent choice and into isn t instantly readable for anyone who has never seen it before tap is known in combinatory logic circles as the k combinator or kestrel k for this reason you can write k as well as tap like into and t  use what you prefer they re both correct to simplify the explanation radically t and k are called combinators because they combine things to produce a result in different ways functional programmers call such things higher order functions but what makes combinators interesting is that combinators work by rearranging the order of things in an expression for example t reverses the order of two things think about it instead of writing adjacent we use t to write t adjacent that rearrangement is very handy for making our code conform to jquery style likewise k leaves them in the same order but removes something so if update returns some text t update some text  but k update it s like update got dropped out of our expression this ability to rearrange things is what makes them so useful for taking code that would normally have function calls sprinkled throughout it and rearranging it into a nice tree of method calls in jquery style many other combinators exist and they are all interesting with applications for functional and oo programmers with combinators you can even get rid of parentheses in a programming language if you aren t familiar with combinatory logic i encourage you to follow the links to my posts about kestrels and thrushes and better still do a little digging about combinatory logic in general it s a rich fascinating field of study that is so simple it s incredibly easy to pick up and it leads naturally into functional and concatenative joy languages i like it so much i want to use it with everything not just jquery good news katy katy is a library that adds k tap and t into to any

1044648, betabuilder is a simple collection of rake tasks and utilities for managing and publishing adhoc builds of your ios apps note as of release   support for xcode  is deprecated xcode  has been out for a year has got much more stable as of   on lion or   if you ve been using the betas and it s time to move on generating xcode  friendly archives and builds in this release still needs a bit of configuration but will become much smoother in   once xcode  support is removed the problem with using a gui app to create the beta packages is that it is yet another manual step in the process of producing an ad hoc build for your beta testers it simplifies some steps but it still requires running build and archive in xcode saving the resulting build as an ipa package running the beta builder app locating the ipa filling in the rest of the fields and generating the deployment files then you need to upload those files somewhere as a ruby developer i use rake in most of my projects to run repetitive often build or test related tasks and it s equally as useful for non ruby projects as it is for ruby ones this simple task library allows you to configure once and then build package and distribute your ad hoc releases with a single command you can install the betabuilder gem from your terminal osx   ships with a perfectly useful ruby installation gem install betabuilder at the top of your rakefile you ll need to require rubygems and the betabuilder gem obviously require rubygems require betabuilder because betabuilder is a rake task library you do not need to define any tasks yourself you simply need to configure betabuilder with some basic information about your project and it will generate the tasks for you a sample configuration might look something like this betabuilder tasks new do and config and your xcode target name config target mygreatapp the xcode configuration profile config configuration adhoc now if you run rake t in terminal app in the root of your project the available tasks will be printed with a brief description of each one rake beta build build the beta release of the app rake beta package package the beta release as an ipa file if you use a custom xcode build directory rather than the default srcroot and build location you can configure that too betabuilder tasks new do and config and  config builddir and path and to and custom and build and dir to deploy your beta to your testers some additional configuration is needed see the next section most of the time you ll not need to run the beta build task directly it will be run automatically as a dependency of beta package upon running this task your ad hoc build will be packaged into an ipa file and will be saved in projectroot and pkg and dist  along with a html index file and the manifest file needed for over the air installation if you are not using the automatic deployment task you will need to upload the contents of the pkg and dist directory to your server to use a namespace other than beta for the generated tasks simply pass in your chosen namespace to betabuilder tasks new betabuilder tasks new mycustomnamespace do and config and this lets you set up different sets of betabuilder tasks for different configurations in the same rakefile e g a production and staging build betabuilder works with xcode  but you may need to tweak your task configuration slightly the most important change you will need to make is the build directory location unless you have configured xcode  to use the build directory relative to your project as in xcode  if you are using the xcode derived data directory for your builds then you will need to specify this betabuilder will then scan your build log to determine the path to the automatically generated build directory that xcode is using for your project config builddir derived this will become the default in   if you wish to generate archives for your xcode  project you will need to enable this this will become the default in future once xcode  support is dropped deprecated in   config xcodearchivemode true if you are working with an xcode  workspace instead of a project file you will need to configure this too config workspacepath myworkspace xcworkspace config scheme my app scheme config appname myapp if you are using a workspace then you must specify the scheme you can still specify the build configuration e g release testflight provides an upload api and betabuilder uses that to provide a testflight upload strategy this strategy requires two pieces of information your testflight api token and your team token config deployusing testflight do and tf and tf apitoken yourapitoken tf teamtoken yourteamtoken now instead of using the beta package task you can run the beta deploy task instead this task will run the package task as a dependency and upload the generated ipa file to testflight you will be prompted to enter the release notes for the build testflight requires these to inform your testers of what has changed in this build alternatively if you have a way of generating the release notes automatically for instance using a changelog file or a git log command  you can specify a block that will be called at runtime you can do whatever you want in this block as long as you return a string which will be used as the release notes e g config deployusing testflight do and tf and  tf generatereleasenotes do return release notes here end finally you can also specify an array of distribution lists that you want to allow access to the build config deployusing testflight do and tf and  tf distributionlists w testers internal betabuilder also comes with a rather rudimentary web based deployment task that uses scp so you will need ssh access to your server and appropriate permissions to use it this works in the same way as the original ios betabuilder gui app by generating a html template and manifest file that can be uploaded to a directly on your server it includes links to install the app automatically on the device or download the ipa file you will to configure betabuilder to use the web deployment strategy with some additional configuration config deployusing web do and web and web remotehost myserver com web remotedirectory and remote and path and to and deployment and directory the deployto setting specifies the url that your app will be published to the remotehost setting is the ssh host that will be used to copy the files to your server using scp finally the remotedirectory setting is the path to the location to your server that files will be uploaded to you will need to configure any virtual hosts on your server to make this work this code is licensed under the mit license copyright c  luke redpath permission is hereby granted free of

1598331, objectivemixin  objectivemixin allows objective c classes to receive additional functionality at runtime similar to the way ruby mixins  work you can extend a class using methods defined in some other class and gain that class s functionality for free since objective c doesn t support multiple inheritance this can be quite useful at times when subclassing isn t an option and protocols don t do exactly what you want this works by taking advantage of the objective c runtime environment and its ability to add methods to an existing class while the program is executing by specifying source and destination classes when performing a mixing operation the destination class gains all of the source class s method implementations there s a small limitation due to the fact that instance variables cannot be added after the class pair is created see apple docs  for classaddivar thus the source class s method implementations must not contain direct references to instance variables this can be easily circumvented by accessing ivars through properties instead of accessing them directly i e self somevalue instead of somevalue the runtime will then synthesize the property in the destination instance instance not class and will work normally  copy mixin h and mixin m into your project  import mixin h  have fun basic example  say you have a source class that looks like this interface ninja nsobject nsstring clanname property nonatomic retain nsstring clanname void doninjastuff implementation ninja synthesize clanname void doninjastuff self clanname iga nslog i m a and my clan name is  self class description  self clanname if you then use mixin to extend turtle with ninja  you get this turtle turtle turtle alloc init mixin from ninja class into turtle class id turtle doninjastuff and and prints i m a turtle and my clan name is iga even though the clanname instance variable does not exist in turtle s definition it is synthesized at runtime in the turtle object and everything works fine note that in order to avoid object may not respond to selector compiler warnings you have to cast the turtle variable to the id type or alternatively to ninja  but id is cleaner in my opinion read the next section to see how to avoid this you can also use mixin from ninja class into turtle class followinheritance yes to mix in all ninja s inherited methods up to the common ancestor of ninja and turtle in other words if we have the following inheritance trees ninja human nsobject and turtle nsobject  then the from into followinheritance method will mix in methods from both ninja and human into turtle  but not from nsobject since it s their common ancestor they already inherit its methods there s also a convenient category defined on top of nsobject it s defined in mixin h as well  so you can use it instead of calling mixin class methods turtle turtle turtle alloc init turtle mixinfrom ninja class and and or mixinfrom followinheritance id turtle doninjastuff and and prints i m a turtle and my clan name is iga be aware that this is just syntactic sugar even though the method is called on an object instance it still extends the class itself i actually prefer using the mixin class since it is more clear by reading the code that you re extending the class functionality not just the functionality of a single object finally if the class you want to mix into already has some of the mixin methods implemented you can keep their original implementations by passing no for force in from to followinheritance force otherwise all methods will be overriden by mixin ones more subtle example  take a look at examples and serializable h there s a serializable class there which you mix into your class at runtime and there s a serializablemixin protocol which your class should implement methods that are marked as required have to be implemented by your class and methods that are marked as optional will be mixed in from the serializable class at runtime the optional methods are defined in the protocol in order to avoid object may not respond to selector compiler warnings now take a look at objectivemixinexamples and mountainbike h this class complies with the serializablemixin protocol by implementing the two required methods from that protocol in objectivemixinexamples and mountainbike m you can see that the serializable class is mixed in in the initialize class method which is invoked by the obj c runtime only once at class creation time this way you re free from worrying about whether you already mixed in a certain class this code is guaranteed to run only once this approach was suggested to me by benedict cohen benedictc  thanks man you should also check out the singleton example in examples and singleton h  i use that one a lot dynamic subclassing by jamie montgomerie  it s now also possible to dynamically create a subclass at runtime in some ways this is akin to being able to create concrete methods in protocols for example you might declare a uiview mixin that stores a block that will be called in place of drawrect like this protocol thdrawrectwithblocks nsobject property nonatomic copy void drawrectblock uiview self cgrect rect interface thdrawrectwithblocksmixin uiview thdrawrectwithblocks implemented like this implementation thdrawrectwithblocksmixin synthesize drawrectblock void drawrect cgrect rect self drawrectblock self rect you can then instantiate objects using the allocwithsuperclass method for example this will create a uibutton that has the methods from your thdrawrectwithblocks class uibutton thdrawrectwithblocks button uibutton thdrawrectwithblocks thdrawrectwithblocksmixin allocwithsuperclass uibutton class initwithframe self view bounds button drawrectblock uiview view cgrect rect uicolor redcolor set uirectfill rect because the subclass is a real subclass even though it s created at runtime it is possible as in the above example to declare properties and even ivars in the mixin class if you name your class with a mixin suffix and your protocol without one as in this example  objective mixin will ensure that the dynamically created class is correctly marked as conforming to the protocol so in thie example objects will respond to button conformstoprotocol protocol thdrawrectwithblocks with yes note that calling super in your mixin code will at runtime call the method of the dynamic superclass so in this case it would be uibutton s methods that would be called not uiview s the convenience allocwithsuperclass method isn t powerful enough to allow more than one dynamic superclass but you can use the more general classwithsuperclass method to chain mixins like this myseconduiviewmixin classwithsuperclass myfirstuiviewmixin classwithsuperclass uiview alloc init objectivemixin is just another mechanism you can use when designing your class hierarchy in addition to the usual objective c design patterns for example you can have an algorithm that is used by multiple classes and you don t want to pollute their ancestor by extending it with a category plus this is a runtime feature so it opens a lot of doors for experimentation feel free to read up on some ruby mixin usage examples and implement them in obj c

5227200, the node in black is a selected central node from the training set and we perform a breadth first walk of the graph out to a maximum distance of  nodes are sized according to their distance from the center and colored according to a chosen metric a personalized pagerank in this case but more on this later we can see that the central node is friends with three other users two of whom on the top left and bottom have fairly large disjoint networks there are a bunch of dangling nodes nodes at distance  with only one connection to the rest of the local network that aren t contributing much to the picture though so let s remove these to reveal the core structure since the default view doesn t encode the distinction between following and follower relationships we can mouse over each node to see who it follows and who it s followed by here for example is the following and follower network of one of the central node s friends here s another following and follower network this time of the central node s friend at the bottom interestingly while the first friend had several followers only in orange  the second friend has none which suggests perhaps a new type of follow hungry feature and here s one more node a little farther out which has nothing but followers a celebrity perhaps let s take a look at another graph one whose local network is a little smaller and one more one whose local network is a little larger i also wanted to take a more quantitative look at the graph here s the distribution of the number of followers of each node in the training set cut off at  followers to better see the graph the maximum number of followers is at   as well as the number of users each node is following again cut off at  the maximum here is  similarly here are the same two graphs but limited to the nodes in the test set alone notice that there are relatively more test set users with  followees than in the full training set and relatively fewer test set users with  followers this information could be used to better simulate a validation set for model selection though i didn t end up doing this myself finally let s move on to the models themselves in order to quickly get up and running on a couple prediction algorithms i started with some unsupervised approaches for example after building a new validation set to test performance offline i tried recommending users who follow you but you don t follow in return recommending users similar to you when representing users as sets of their followers and using cosine similarity and jaccard similarity as the similarity metric recommending users based on a personalized pagerank score recommending users that the people you follow also follow and so on combining the votes of these algorithms in a fairly ad hoc way e g  by taking the majority vote or by ordering by the number of followers this worked quite well actually but i d been planning to move on to a more machine learned model based approach from the beginning so i did that next my validation set was formed by deleting random edges from the full training set a slightly better approach as mentioned above might have been to more accurately simulate the distribution of the official test set but i didn t end up trying this out myself in order to run a machine learning algorithm to recommend edges which would take two nodes a source and a candidate destination and generate a score measuring the likelihood that the source would follow the destination  it was necessary to prune the set of candidates to run the algorithm on i used two approaches for this filtering step both based on random walks on the graph the first approach was to calculate a personalized pagerank around each source node briefly a personalized pagerank is just like standard pagerank except that when randomly teleporting to a new node the surfer always teleports back to the given source node being personalized rather than to a node chosen uniformly at random as in the standard pagerank algorithm that is the random surfer in the personalized pagerank model works as follows he starts at the source node x that we want to calculate a personalized pagerank around at step i with probability p  the surfer moves to a neighboring node chosen uniformly at random with probability  p  the surfer instead teleports back to the original source node x the limiting probability that the surfer is at node n is then the personalized pagerank score of node n around x here s some scala code that computes approximate personalized pagerank scores and takes the highest scoring nodes as the candidates to feed into the machine learning model calculate a personalized pagerank around the given user and return a list of the nodes with the highest personalized pagerank scores return a list of node probability of landing at this node after running a personalized pagerank for k iterations pairs def pagerank user int list int double and and this map holds the probability of landing at each node up to the current iteration val probs map int double probs user  and and we start at this user val pagerankprobs pagerankhelper start probs numpagerankiterations

give it some score in the first iteration this user propagates its score equally to its neighbors in the second iteration each user duplicates and keeps half of its score s it then propagates s equally to its neighbors in subsequent iterations the process is repeated except that neighbors reached via a backwards link don t duplicate and keep half of their score the idea being that we want the score to reach followees and not followers here s some scala code to calculate these propagation scores calculate propagation scores around the current user in the first propagation round we give the starting node n an initial score s propagate the score equally to each of n s neighbors followers and followings each first level neighbor then duplicates and keeps half of its score and then propagates the original again to its neighbors in further rounds neighbors then repeat the process except that neighbors traveled to via a backwards and follower link don t keep half of their score

except for the starting node s immediate neighbors and and don t keep any score for themselves  i played around with tweaking some parameters in both approaches e g  weighting followers and followees differently  but the natural defaults as used in the code above ended up performing the best after pruning the set of candidate destination nodes to a more feasible level i fed pairs of source destination nodes into a machine learning model from each pair i extracted about  features in total as mentioned above one feature that worked quite well on its own was whether the destination node already follows the source i also used a wide set of similarity based features for example the jaccard similarity between the source and destination when both are represented as sets of their followers when both are represented as sets of their followees or when one is represented as a set of followers while the other is represented as a set of followees abstract class similaritymetric t def apply set set t  set set t double object jaccardsimilarity extends similaritymetric int and returns the jaccard similarity between two sets  if both are empty and def apply set set int  set set

are empty and def apply set set int  set set int double if set size  set size   else set set size tofloat and math sqrt set size set size  and and and and features and and returns the similarity between user and user when both are represented as sets of followers def similaritybyfollowers user int user int implicit similarity similaritymetric int double similarity apply getfollowerswithout user user  getfollowerswithout user user and and etc along the same lines i also computed a similarity score between the destination node and the source node s followees and several variations thereof iterate over each of user s followings compute their similarity with user when both are represented as sets of followers and return the sum of these similarities def followerbasedsimilaritytofollowing user int user int implicit similarity similaritymetric int double getfollowingswithout user user map similaritybyfollowers  user similarity sum other features included the number of followers and followees of each node the ratio of these the personalized pagerank and propagation scores themselves the number of followers in common and triangle and closure type features e g  whether the source node is friends with a node x who in turn is a friend of the destination node if i had had more time i would probably have tried weighted and more regularized versions of some of these features as well e g  downweighting nodes with large numbers of followers when computing cosine similarity scores based on followees or shrinking the scores of nodes we have little information about  but i didn t get a chance this time around but what are these features actually doing as much as i enjoy black box models i m an insights guy so i m even more interested in what my models are doing and why so let s use the same app i built before to take a look here s the local network of node  different from the node above  where each node is colored by its personalized pagerank higher scores are in darker red if we look at the following vs follower relationships of the central node recall that purple is friends teal is followings orange is followers we can see that as expected because i double weighted edges in my personalized pagerank calculation that represented both following and follower  the darkest red nodes are those that are friends of the central node while those in a following only or follower only relationship have a lower score now how does my propagation score compare to personalized pagerank here i colored each node according to the log ratio of its propagation score and personalized pagerank comparing this coloring with the local follow and follower network we can see that followed nodes in teal receive a higher propagation weight than friend nodes in purple  while follower nodes in orange receive almost no propagation score at all going back to node  let s look at a different metric here each node is colored according to its jaccard similarity with the source when nodes are represented by the set of their followers we can see that while the pagerank and propagation metrics tended to favor nodes close to the central node this jaccard similarity feature helps us explore nodes that are further out however if we look the high scoring nodes more closely we see that they often have only a single connection to the rest of the network in other words their high score is due to the fact that they don t have many connections to begin with so their jaccard similarity is unexpectedly high this suggests that some regularization or shrinking is in order so here s a regularized version of jaccard similarity where we downweight nodes with few connections we can see that the outlier nodes are much more muted this time around for a starker difference compare the following two graphs of the jaccard similarity metric around node  the first graph is an unregularized version the second is regularized notice in particular how the popular node in the top left and the popular nodes at the bottom have a much higher score when we regularize for the machine learning algorithms on top of my features i experimented with two types of models logistic regression using both l and l regularization and random forests if i had more time i would probably have done some more parameter tuning and maybe tried gradient boosted trees as well suppose you re very indecisive so whenever you want to watch a movie you ask your friend willow if she thinks you ll like it in order to answer willow first needs to figure out what movies you like so you give her a bunch of movies and tell her whether you liked each one or not i e  you give her a labeled training set then when you ask her if she thinks you ll like movie x or not she plays a  questions like game with imdb asking questions like is x a romantic movie  does johnny depp star in x  and so on she asks more informative questions first i e  she maximizes the information gain of each question  and gives you a yes and no answer at the end thus willow is a decision tree for your movie preferences but willow is only human so she doesn t always generalize your preferences very well i e  she overfits in order to get more accurate recommendations you d like to ask a bunch of your friends and watch movie x if most of them say they think you ll like it that is instead of asking only willow you want to ask woody apple and cartman as well and they vote on whether you ll like a movie i e  you build an ensemble classifier aka a forest in this case now you don t want each of your friends to do the same thing and give you the same answer so you first give each of them slightly different data after all you re not absolutely sure of your preferences yourself you told willow you loved titanic but maybe you were just happy that day because it was your birthday so maybe some of your friends shouldn t use the fact that you liked titanic in making their recommendations or maybe you told her you loved cinderella but actually you really really loved it so some of your friends should give cinderella more weight so instead of giving your friends the same data you gave willow you give them slightly perturbed versions you don t change your love and hate decisions you just say you love and hate some movies a little more or less you give each of your friends a bootstrapped version of your original training data for example whereas you told willow that you liked black swan and harry potter and disliked avatar you tell woody that you liked black swan so much you watched it twice you disliked avatar and don t mention harry potter at all by using this ensemble you hope that while each of your friends gives somewhat idiosyncratic recommendations willow thinks you like vampire movies more than you do woody thinks you like pixar movies and cartman thinks you just hate everything  the errors get canceled out in the majority thus your friends now form a bagged bootstrap aggregated forest of your movie preferences there s still one problem with your data however while you loved both titanic and inception it wasn t because you like movies that star leonardio dicaprio maybe you liked both movies for other reasons thus you don t want your friends to all base their recommendations on whether leo is in a movie or not so when each friend asks imdb a question only a random subset of the possible questions is allowed i e  when you re building a decision tree at each node you use some randomness in selecting the attribute to split on say by randomly selecting an attribute or by selecting an attribute from a random subset this means your friends aren t allowed to ask whether leonardo dicaprio is in the movie whenever they want so whereas previously you injected randomness at the data level by perturbing your movie preferences slightly now you re injecting randomness at the model level by making your friends ask different questions at different times and so your friends now form a random forest  step  read in the training examples  truths a truth is  for a known true edge or  for a false edge trainingexamples each training example

importance scores as determined by one of my random forest models which unsurprisingly consistently outperformed logistic regression the random forest classifier here is one of my earlier models using a slightly smaller subset of my full suite of features  where the targeting step consisted of taking the top  nodes with the highest propagation scores we can see that the most important variables are personalized pagerank scores i put in both normalized and unnormalized versions where the normalized versions consisted of taking all the candidates for a particular source node and scaling them so that the maximum personalized pagerank score was  whether the destination node already follows the source how similar the source node is to the people the destination node is following when each node is represented as a set of followers note that this is more or less measuring how likely the destination is to follow the source which we already saw is a good predictor of whether the source is likely to follow the destination plus several variations on this theme e g  how similar the destination node is to the source node s followers when each node is represented as a set of followees now how do all of these models compare to each other is the random forest model universally better than the logistic regression model or are there some sets of users for which the logistic regression model actually performs better here i bucketed all test nodes into buckets based on the logarithm of their number of followers and calculated the mean average precision of an algorithm that recommends nodes to follow using a personalized pagerank and of an algorithm that recommends nodes that are following the source user but are not yet followed back in return we see that except for the case of  followers where obviously the is followed by algorithm can do nothing  the personalized pagerank algorithm gets increasingly better in comparison at first the two algorithms have roughly equal performance but as the source node gets more followers the personalized pagerank algorithm performs increasingly better for completeness here are the individually bucketed mean average precisions for each feature let s look at one more here i compared my sim to followings by followers feature which sums the jaccard similarity between the candidate node and each of the source node s followings when nodes are represented by their set of followers against my sim by followings feature which computes the jaccard similarity between the candidate and the source when both are represented by their followings  and we can see that except for the initial case of  followees the performance of the first feature gets monotonically better as the source node follows more and more users admittedly building a slicer like this is probably overkill for a kaggle competition where the set of variables to dice by is fairly limited but imagine instead that this is the real world where new algorithms are tried out every week and vast amounts of data are collected about every user and we can slice the performance of a new model by a user s geography or the user s interests or by how frequently they log in let s switch directions slightly and think about how we could make our computations more matrix based i didn t do this in the competition this is more a preview of another post i m writing and

is this matrix formulation a more natural way of expressing the algorithm but since scalding by way of cascading supports both local and distributed modes this code runs just as easily on a hadoop cluster of thousands of machines assuming our social network is orders of magnitude larger than the one in the contest as on a sample of data for a laptop big data big matrix style boom here s another

of exposition suppose you ve bought a bunch of books on amazon and amazon wants to recommend a new book you ll like since amazon knows similarities between all pairs of books one natural way to generate this recommendation is to  take every book b  calculate the similarity between b and each book you bought  sum up all these similarities to get your recommendation score for b in other words the recommendation score for book b on user u is diduserbuy u book  similaritybetween book b book  and diduserbuy u book  similaritybetween book b book and and diduserbuy u book n similaritybetween

comfortable expressing their computations in a vector manner being able to write all your computations as matrix manipulations often makes experimenting with different algorithms much more fluid for example imagine you want to switch from l normalization to l normalization or that you want to express your objects as binary sets rather than weighted vectors both of these are simple one line changes when you have vectors and matrices as first class objects but become much more tedious especially in a mapreduce land where this matrix library was designed to be applied when you don t by now i think i ve spent more time writing this post than on the contest itself so let s wrap up i often get questions about what kinds of tools i like to use so for this competition my kit consisted of scala for code that needed to be fast e g  extracting features or that i was going to run repeatedly e g  scoring my validation set ruby for quick one off scripts r for some data analysis and simple

2918838, katy coffeescript and javascript combinators katy makes writing fluent fluent coffeescript and javascript easy by providing the k and t combinators for ordinary classes and objects in plain english katy lets you turn any method into a fluent method for chaining and katy lets you use functions as extension methods for any object snarf the source here or install it with npm install katy katy adds two methods k and t  to any classes or objects you desire coffeescript kt mixinto array   k pop returns            k push   returns              k arr arr slice  sort a b a b returns             t arr arr slice  sort a b a b returns        you re familiar with fluent interfaces fluent like jquery a fluent interface uses methods that are written in such a way that you can chain methods together producing code that reads naturally from left to right or from top to bottom for example javascript and and without fluent interface mycar car mycar setspeed  mycar setcolor blue mycar setdoors  and and with fluent interface fluentcar car setspeed  setcolor blue setdoors  fluent interfaces rely on the author of the api making sure that each method returns its receiver so that you can chain the next method to it jquery does this effectively and libraries like underscore u provide some special support for chaining its methods as well but what if you have some objects that weren t written with chaining in mind katy s k allows you to make any function or method fluent even if the original author has other ideas it s very similar to underscore s  tap although it has some extra tricks up its sleeve such as calling a method by name we ll use a ridiculously simple example to demonstrate the pop method of array returns what it pops not the array so if you want to pop a few things off an array and then do something with what s left you can mix katy into array and use k to call pop by name coffeescript kt mixinto array k pop k pop k pop sort a b a b returns        another aspect of fluent interfaces is that you don t want to mix function calls with methods you want to make everything read naturally in one direction so you can call k with a function either named or anonymous instead of a method name compare these two examples coffeescript popn arr n for x in  n arr pop arr   popn arr  sort a b a b returns        kt mixinto array k popn  sort a b a b returns        some people would say this is a minor detail but when writing code for people to read no detail is too small nd hey that sort a b a b looks handy let s make it a function so we can use it again coffeescript numsort arr arr sort a b a b k popn  k numsort returns        as you may have noticed you can also pass additional parameters to your functions or named methods in the code above popn is called with a first parameter of the receiver and a second parameter of  passing functions to k provides two wins it makes the functions fluent and you also get something a little like a c extension methods you get to write your own methods like popn and numsort for classes without opening them up and monkey patching them to recap when you use k  you can give any built in method fluent return the receiver semantics and  you can make any function into something that can be called like a method making your code read more naturally and allowing you to extend classes without opening up their prototypes as you saw above katy s k allows you to extend classes with your own functions just as if they were built in methods and it makes them fluent by returning the receiver sometimes you want to fluently extend a class with your own function but you don t want it to return the receiver let s say you like numsort  but you want to return a copy of the array that is numerically sorted coffeescript sortedcopy arr slice  sort a b a b k sortedcopy returns           bzzt fail k isn t what we want because k always returns the receiver but we like being able to fluently extend objects with our own functions what we need is a method that takes a function as an argument and calls the function with the receiver and any additional arguments of course katy provides this and it s called t coffeescript sortedcopy arr slice  sort a b a b t sortedcopy returns           win here s another example a custom array filter coffeescript identifiers arrofsymbols arrofsymbols filter str and a za z w and test str sna   fu  bar  wayticket sort t identifiers map i i length returns    t lets you use identifiers as if it were a method baked into array you could write identifiers somearray sort  but as we saw above when you are chaining together multiple calls you want your expression to read very naturally from left to right on one line or from top to bottom on one line in summary t is very much like having c s extension methods in your coffeescript and javascript projects without returning the receiver no problem you don t need to mix it into a core class you can wrap an object without altering its prototype coffeescript kt hello k s s and world returns hello kt hello t s s and world returns hello world you can also chain multiple invocations in a style borrowed from monads m and underscore u coffeescript kt   chain k pop k pop k pop t pop value returns  for what it s worth altering core classes is tricky if you re writing a library for others to use but could be just fine nobreak if you re writing an application and not making life tricky for downstream programmers and of course you can mix katy into your own classes while wrapping core classes like array if you prefer as you know katy accepts any function as an argument to k and t  as in coffeescript kt hello t s s and world returns hello world coffeescript makes writing functions pretty easy but if you re using javascript writing short functions is not quite as much fun javascript kt hello t function s return s and world and and returns hello world the ceremonial trappings overwhelm the logic of what you re writing that s doubly painful since you re already adding some extra indirection by using katy so katy lets you define one liner functions using a highly abbreviated syntax invented by oliver steele osteele called string lambdas here s the cheat sheet javascript and and like coffeescript katy supports using in a string you don t need to parenthesize and and the arguments and no explicit return is needed kt hello t s s and world and and returns hello world and and implicit parameters and and if you don t use  katy will attempt to infer the parameters in your expression and and from left to right kt hello t str and world and and returns hello world and and if you use an underscore by itself katy will assume that s your only parameter and and yes this conflicts with the underscore library but that s ok string lambdas and and are best for short simple things note that in this example katy knows not and and to assume that world is a parameter window world world kt hello t  and and world and and returns hello world and and point free and and for certain very simple expressions katy will assume parameters even if you don t supply them kt hello t and world and and returns hello world kt hello t and  world and and returns hello world and and this works for simple message sending and property access as well kt hello t touppercase and and hello kt hello t length and and  you can t be serious oh yes i can sl string lambdas are slower than native javascript but when used judiciously they make your code easier to read and understand perhaps not easier to read and understand by a junior developer who is unfamiliar with anything you can t look up on wschools but easier to read and understand by an experienced colleague working with the same code base absolutely t is known in some cs circles as the thrush t or t combinator likewise k is known in combinatory logic circles as the k combinator or kestrel k to simplify the explanation radically t and k are called combinators because they combine things to produce a result in different ways functional programmers call such things higher order functions but what makes combinators interesting is that combinators work by rearranging the order of things in an expression for example t reverses the order of two things think about it instead of writing identifiers somearray  we use t to write somearray t identifiers that rearrangement is very handy for making our code conform to fluent style likewise k leaves them in the same order but removes something this ability to rearrange things is what makes them so useful for taking code that would normally have function calls sprinkled throughout it and rearranging it into a nice tree of method calls in fluent style many other combinators exist and they are all interesting with applications for functional and oo programmers with combinators you can even get rid of parentheses in a programming language if you aren t familiar with combinatory logic i encourage you to follow the links to my posts about kestrels and thrushes and better still do a little digging about combinatory logic in general it s a rich fascinating field of study that is so simple it s incredibly easy to pick up and it leads naturally into functional and concatenative joy languages  my blog posts about combinators starting with the kestrel k and thrush t i agree sans titre  but that being said  you can use katy now instead of waiting to see if coffeescript adopts a syntax for chaining methods   and  the k and t methods turn any function into something you can call like a method which makes your code read more cleanly yes y and if you like katy you ll love jquery combinators jc post scriptum  the mit license with contributions from ben alman and oliver steele permission is

return status  headers content type text and plain  content length string text length  body text  jackup jackup looks for a file called jackconfig js in the current directory or you can specify a path to a jack application compatible modules much like python or ruby modules you do not have to use module pattern boilerplate every module has its own local scope you can get the exports object of another module by calling require var fs require file fs isfile foo txt module identifiers for require come in three flavors top level  relative  and absolute in the above case file is a top level identifier so it will load any module called file js in the lib directory of whichever package comes first in the load path relative identifiers have or as their first term and terms are delimited with and so in the foo and bar module require and baz will load foo and baz absolute module identifiers should not be used directly but are produced when you execute a program module outside the module path the module is identified by its fully qualified path starting with and you can export an object by assigning it to exports exports foo function return hello in a module you also get a module object that has module id and module path properties so you can inspect your own top level module identifier and the path of your own module file you also get a require main property that tells you the top level module identifier of the module that started the program if require main module main var settings require require main var fs require file var path fs path module path var indexhtml path resolve and template and index html read beyond the commonjs specification you also get the print function and the system module object for free the print function accepts variadic arguments and writes a single line containing the arguments delimited by spaces to standard output and flushes the system module can be explicitly required with require system as is encouraged since it is necessary

3648886, siri server core  do you like this  if you like this piece of software you can help me by donating i can afford new devices and so get deeper to the core of all of this make it even cooler or if you just want to give me a little credit for my work but don t worry the code will remain free you don t have to donate os x   update the new dictate function of os x mountain lion uses the same backing engine as siri on ios therefore this server is able to work with os x   if you want to use it you can configure your mac to use siriserver i added a minor fix to display a connected mac correctly if you want to configure your mac to use siriserver you can edit the and library and preferences and com apple assistant plist it follows the same syntax as on ios or you can download a preference pane for the system preferences i wrote which allows you to set some important values just unzip it an install the siriprefsforosx prefpane by double clicking it you should activate speech dictation before using it i haven t tested every scenario thoroughly ios  update i cannot guarantee that the version here will work with anything pre ios  there were some changes in ios  to use the server with ios  you must disable siri s authentication mechanism you can do this by adding or via cydia see below key authentication disabled and key and var and mobile and library and preferences and com apple assistant plist the easiest way to do so is like this ssh into your device cd and var and mobile and library and preferences plutil convert xml com apple assistant plist now edit the contents with your favorite editor and add between dict and dict underneath keys account and keys key authentication disabled and key to difficult you can also install my tweak available via cydia which takes care of all of this also it allows you to select siriserver tweaks check your preferences app for further settings what is this  this is a very early version of a siri server not a proxy apple s siri is an voice controlled assistant on iphone s with jailbreaking you can install it on other idevices however siri needs a server to communicate to do the speech processing apple only allows s devices on their servers this project tries to recreate the apple siri server to use it with other idevices you don t need any s keys to make it work as it is independent from apple it uses google speech to text api and therefore we are currently limited to commands that are shorter than  seconds maybe we can overcome this setup notes and instructions  install audio libraries on linux simply install it via you packet manager e g or see instructions and note for os x sudo apt get install libspeex libflac on os x download libspeex and libflac from the websites above the sources not the binaries and compile and install them or simply follow the following steps tar xf speex  rc tar gz cd speex  rc and configure sudo make install tar xf flac    tar gz cd flac    and configure disable asm optimizations sudo make install note you can also install libspeex via macports but libflac is not available in bit through macports to make it build with bit support you need to supply disable asm optimizations in configure of libflac to make it compile python requirements as this project is coded with python you need a python interpreter this is usually already installed i work with python    and    and both work you also need some python packages to make it work pyopenssl is also a requirement for twisted so installing twisted will already force an installation of pyopenssl on a debian based system twisted can be installed via apt sudo apt get install python twisted on os x you can install it via easyinstall sudo easyinstall pyopenssl twisted or via macports sudo port install py openssl py twisted certificate generation you also need to generate certificates for this server they must be placed in the keys and directory there are dummy files to show you the correct names installing api keys to allow plugins to reuse api keys there is an apikeys conf in the root directory of the server note in this git there is only a dummy file example the general format is as follows apiname plugin api key the apiname is usually printed in error messages when you miss a certain api key running the server now you are ready to go start the server with python siriserver py you don t need to run it as root as we use https port  if you want to use another port use python siriserver py port portnum note for ports  you need to run the server as root e g via sudo common errors  if we had the mid s this section would glow and sparkle to get your attention there are some errors that might occur even though you did everything that was written above the server just crashes after a speechpacket you are running linux right probably debian there is probably already a libspeex on your machine which is optimized for sse which does not work with python reason check if there is a and usr and lib and sse and libspeex so  option a delete it there should also be a version in and usr and lib if you installed via apt or in and usr and local and lib if you compiled by hand option b todo i cannot get a connection from device to server do you access your server over the internet you need to setup your firewall and nat to allow traffic for tcp port  directed to your server do you have a local firewall on the machine running the server also check if tcp port  is allowed for incomming connections you must also make sure to setup the corret server and port in the spire configuration there is something with ssl in the error have you installed the ca pem file on your phone do you have more than one ca certificate installed for the same domain try deleting all certificates on the device and install the one created by gencerts can i somehow verify the correct certificate yes start siriserver py then take your ca pem you think belongs to your servers certificate and run echo and openssl sclient connect domain    and sed ne and begin certificate and  and end certificate and p and openssl verify cafile keys and ca pem make sure to replace domain with the actual domain of the machine running siriserver py e g an ip address if your ca pem matches your server certificate you should see stdin ok as output ok what else we can also setup a small test server using openssl to check if ssl is working and to check if the iphone correctly validates the server certificate openssl sserver cert keys and server crt key keys and server key accept  state when you run this siriserver should not run it opens a basis server on port  using your servers certificate now you can connect with your iphone as if you would use siri of course siri won t work we are just testing the ssl layer it should output something like this note the ace http request near the end using default temp dh parameters using default temp ecdh parameters sslaccept before

3198831, siri server  do you like this  if you like this piece of software you can help me by donating i can afford new devices and so get deeper to the core of all of this make it even cooler or if you just want to give me a little credit for my work but don t worry the code will remain free you don t have to donate important  please do not post installation problems or other non code related stuff in the github issues section there are currently only  plugins here you can chat a little bit with siri you can ask it for the current time and the current time at a certain point in the world and you can ask it for the meaning of life also you can ask it for the weather create timers ask for definitions of words control your xbmc work with notes and ask several question to wolfram alpha you can contribute by making more plugins what is this  this is a very early version of a siri server not a proxy apple s siri is an voice controlled assistant on iphone s with jailbreaking you can install it on other idevices however siri needs a server to communicate to do the speech processing apple only allows s devices on their servers this project tries to recreate the apple siri server to use it with other idevices you don t need any s keys to make it work as it is independent from apple it uses google speech to text api and therefore we are currently limited to commands that are shorter than  seconds maybe we can overcome this what s new  we have a new plugin system it supports multi language inputs what else is here  the file siriprotocol documents everything i and others found out about the protocol by now setup notes and instructions  installer install audio libraries on linux simply install it via you packet manager e g or see instructions and note for os x sudo apt get install libspeex libflac on os x download libspeex and libflac from the websites above the sources not the binaries and compile and install them or simply follow the following steps tar xf speex  rc tar gz cd speex  rc and configure sudo make install tar xf flac    tar gz and configure disable asm optimizations sudo make install note you can also install libspeex via macports but libflac is not available in bit through macports to make it build with bit support you need to supply disable asm optimizations in configure of libflac to make it compile python requirements as this project is coded with python you need a python interpreter this is usually already installed i work with python    and    and both work you also need some python packages to make it work mcrypto you can install both via easyinstall  on linux you can also get it via your packet manager sudo apt get install python setuptools after you installed it run easyinstall biplist easyinstall mcrypto certificate generation we also need to generate certificates for guzzoni apple com or any other domain cd gencerts and gencerts sh and gencerts sh     and gencerts sh domain com this will generate a certifcaite for guzzoni apple com      or domain com when you use spire just enter as address what ever parameter you supplied to gencerts sh e g in case you don t have spire or want to use guzzoni apple com you need to setup a dns spoofing or manipulate you hosts file please make sure to install the ca certificate on your idevice you can simply mail it to yourself it is the ca pem file that was copied by gencerts sh to the servers root in your mail just click on the certificate and install it installing api keys some of the plugins included require api and appid keys to use you ll need to register with the respective websites to obtain these keys the general format is as follows apiname plugin api key the apiname is usually printed in error messages when you miss a certain api key where to obtain api keys register and sign up for an api with the following sites why don t you give me your key the api application programming interface keys are necessary to allow some plugins to use different services on the internet those api keys are like a username password combination and grant access to several resources online like wolframalpha they make it very easy to use the resources in a computer program as you must buy a api key if you want to use it for multiple users or commercially that are usually the terms for apis we cannot distribute the keys here in github and must require users to create them on their own they are usually free for noncommercial and personal use running the server now you are ready to go start the server with sudo python siriserver py note you need to run it as root as we use https port  non root can only use ports  for incomming connections running the server as a service for ubuntu and debian and  copy the script from startupscripts and siriserver to and etc and init d sudo cp startupscripts and siriserver and etc and init d and siriserver  edit the script fill in the path to your siriserver folder sudo nano and etc and init d and siriserver  make executable sudo chmod a and x and etc and init d and siriserver  add it to the startup items sudo update rc d siriserver defaults  start with sudo service siriserver start you can now start restart and stop siriserver just as you started it in step   sudo cp startupscripts and net siriserver plist and library and launchdaemons  sudo launchctl load and library and launchdaemons and net siriserver plist common errors  if we had the mid s this section would glow and sparkle to get your attention there are some errors that might occur even though you did everything that was written above the server just crashes after a speechpacket you are running linux right probably debian there is probably already a libspeex on your machine which is optimized for sse which does not work with python reason check if there is a and usr and lib and sse and libspeex so  option a delete it there should also be a version in and usr and lib if you installed via apt or in and usr and local and lib if you compiled by hand option b todo this mcrypto thing is not working i cannot get a connection from device to server do you access your server over the internet you need to setup your firewall and nat to allow traffic for tcp port  directed to your server do you have a local firewall on the machine running the server also check if tcp port  is allowed for incomming connections there is an exception with something around a database lock error uncaptured python exception closing channel main handleconnection connected xxx xxx xxx xxx xxxx at xac database is locked solution delete the sqlite file and restart server there is something with ssl in the error have you installed the ca pem file on your phone do you have more than one ca certificate installed for the same domain try deleting all certificates on the device and install the one created by gencerts can i somehow verify the correct certificate yes start siriserver py then take your ca pem you think belongs to your servers certificate and run echo and openssl sclient connect domain    and sed ne and begin certificate and  and end certificate and p and openssl verify cafile ca pem make sure to replace domain with the actual domain of the machine running siriserver py e g an ip address if your ca pem matches your server certificate you should see stdin ok as output ok what else we can also setup a small test server using openssl to check if ssl is working and to check if the iphone correctly validates the server certificate sudo openssl sserver cert server passless crt key server passless key accept  state when you run this siriserver should not run it opens a basis server on port  using your servers certificate now you can connect with your iphone as if you would use siri of course siri won t

1896381, a concurrent hash trie or ctrie is a concurrent thread safe lock free implementation of a hash array mapped trie it is used to implement the concurrent map abstraction it has particularly scalable concurrent insert and remove operations and is memory efficient it supports o   atomic lock free snapshots which are used to implement linearizable lock free size iterator and clear operations the cost of evaluating the lazy snapshot is distributed across subsequent updates thus making snapshot evaluation horizontally scalable as the ctrie is a part of the scala standard library since the version   clients using versions   x can use this implementation more info about ctries  requirements jdk  or higher  run sbt once the sbt command is run in the root directory of the project it will download the appropriate scala library and compiler from maven it will start the sbt interactive shell generally to run sbt tasks you have to start the sbt shell  update dependencies within the sbt shell type the command update and hit enter this will resolve all the library dependencies from maven e g the scalatest library  compile within the sbt shell compile this will compile the project after this you can run tests using the test command or run benchmarks using the bench command the ctries package contains an up to date version of the ctrie data structure the ctries package contains a previous version of the ctrie data structure the difference is that the previous version uses one i node per a stored key value pair resulting in an additional indirection and increased memory usage this previous version is useful to compare performance and memory usage against the preferred version in the ctries package the master branch contains an up to date version of the ctrie data structure with snapshot support implemented the no snapshots branch contains the version of the ctrie data structure without snapshot support this branch is useful to compare snapshot support overhead in my experiments   slowdown on a m element dataset tests are run using the test command in the sbt shell they can also be run selectively like this test only ctries lnodespec which runs the tests associated with l nodes benchmarks are located in the src and bench and scala directory they are run by using the bench command in the sbt shell which will start a new jvm instance do the warmup and run the selected snippet a number of times generally you will have to inspect what parameters the specific benchmark expects in order to run it for example to run the insertion benchmark for k elements using  threads and repeat this test  times you have to write bench dsz  dpar  ctries multiinsertctrie   this specific benchmark will evenly distribute the work of inserting sz elements into an empty ctrie between par threads it s also possible to run benchmarks in batches to produce a range of results using the bench batch task in the sbt shell this will run a perl script to gather the data and convert them to latex tikz format used for figures all benchmarks presented in the paper are available within this project

1621557, this app was further refactored  and  a complete backbone js and jquery mobile sample app using amd for separation of modules require js for dependency management and template externalisation and underscore for templating the app allows you to search for images using the flickr api lookup individual photos in more detail bookmark any state for results or photos supports pagination and more li backbone js to aid application structure routing and li li underscore js for micro templating and utilities and li li require js and amd for modular separation of components and li li require js text plugin to enable external templates and li li jquery mobile and jquery for dom manipulation mobile helpers and li li flickr api for data and li strong note and strong this application needs to be run on a http server local or otherwise to remove this requirement simply switch from using external templates via require js and the text plugin to inline ones in no particular order in case you haven t used it before require js is a popular script loader written by james burke a developer who has been quite instrumental in helping shape the amd module format which we ll discuss more shortly some of require js s capabilities include helping to load multiple script files helping define modules with or without dependencies and loading in non script dependencies such as text files so why use require js with backbone although backbone is excellent when it comes to providing a sanitary structure to your applications there are a few key areas where some additional help could be used  backbone doesn t endorse a particular approach to modular development although this means it s quite open ended for developers to opt for classical patterns like the module pattern or object literals for structuring their apps which both work fine  it also means developers aren t sure of what works best when other concerns come into play such as dependency management require js is compatible with the amd asynchronous module definition format a format which was born from a desire to write something better than the write lots of script tags with implicit dependencies and manage them manually approach to development in addition to allowing you to clearly declare dependencies amd works well in the browser supports string ids for dependencies declaring multiple modules in the same file and gives you easy to use tools to avoid polluting the global namespace  let s discuss dependency management a little more as it can actually be quite challenging to get right if you re doing it by hand when we write modules in javascript we ideally want to be able to handle the reuse of code units intelligently and sometimes this will mean pulling in other modules at run time whilst at other times you may want to do this dynamically to avoid a large pay load when the user first hits your application think about the gmail web client for a moment when users initially load up the page on their first visit google can simply hide widgets such as the chat module until a user has indicated by clicking expand that they wish to use it through dynamic dependency loading google could load up the chat module only then rather than forcing all users to load it when the page first initializes this can improve performance and load times and can definitely prove useful when building larger applications as discussed above the overall goal for the amd format is to provide a solution for modular javascript that developers can use today the two key concepts you need to be aware of when using it with a script loader are a code define and code method for facilitating module definition and a code require and code method for handling dependency loading em define and em is used to define named or unnamed modules based on the proposal using the following signature and p moduleid and optional and  dependencies and optional and  definition function and function for instantiating the module or object and as you can tell by the inline comments the code moduleid and code is an optional argument which is typically only required when non amd concatenation tools are being used there may be some other edge cases where it s useful too when this argument is left out we call the module anonymous when working with anonymous modules the idea of a module s identity is dry making it trivial to avoid duplication of filenames and code back to the define signature the dependencies argument represents an array of dependencies which are required by the module you are defining and the third argument definition function is a function that s executed to instantiate your module a barebone module compatible with require js could be defined using code define and code as follows and p and and a module id has been omitted here to make the module anonymous define foo  bar  and and module definition function and and dependencies foo and bar are mapped to function parameters function foo bar and and return a value that defines the module export and and i e the functionality we want to expose for consumption and and create your module here var mymodule dostuff function console log yay stuff   return mymodule code require and code on the other hand is typically used to load code in a top level javascript file or within a module should you wish to dynamically fetch dependencies an example of its usage is and p and and consider foo and bar are two external modules and and in this example the exports from the two modules loaded are passed as and and function arguments to the callback foo and bar and and so that they can similarly be accessed require foo  bar  function foo bar and and rest of your code here foo dosomething strong defining amd modules using require js and strong and and todo explain and demonstrate how to wrap views etc inside amd modules and how that all works require app and mymodule  function mymodule and and start the main module which in turn and and loads other modules var module new mymodule module dostuff my side project todomvc now includes a modular backbone example using amd and require js thanks to thomas davis for anyone wishing to look at a sample without any of the jquery mobile code included this covers how to wrap your views models modules etc using amd and also cleanly demonstrates handling dependency management as well as flickly does moving your underscore and mustache and handlebars templates to external files is actually quite straight forward as this application makes use of require js i ll discuss how to implement external templates using this specific script loader requirejs has a special plugin called text js which is used to load in text file dependencies to use the text plugin simply follow these simple steps  next include the text js plugin in your initial require js configuration options in the code snippet below we assume that require js is being included in our page prior to this code snippet being executed any of the other scripts being loaded are just there for the sake of example require config paths backbone libs and amdbackbone     underscore libs and underscore     text libs and require and text  jquery libs and jquery     json libs and json  datepicker libs and jquery ui datepicker  datepickermobile libs and jquery ui datepicker mobile  jquerymobile libs and jquery mobile   baseurl app  when the code text and code prefix is used for a dependency require js will automatically load the text plugin and treat the dependency as a text resource a typical example of this in action may look like require js and app  text templates and mainview html  function app mainview and and the contents of the mainview file will be and and loaded into mainview for usage  finally we can use the text resource that s been loaded for templating purposes you re probably used to storing your html templates inline using a script with a specific identifier with underscore js s micro templating and jquery this would typically be lt script type quot text and template quot id quot mainviewtemplate quot gt lt  each person function personitem gt lt li gt lt personitem get quot name quot gt lt and li gt lt gt lt and script gt var compiledtemplate  template mainviewtemplate html with require js and the text plugin however it s as simple as saving your template into an external text file say mainview html and doing the following require js and app  text templates and mainview html  function app mainview var compiledtemplate  template mainview that s it you can then go applying your template to a view in backbone doing something like collection someview el html compiledtemplate results collection models all templating solutions will have their own custom methods for handling template compilation but if you understand the above substituting underscore s micro templating for any other solution should be fairly trivial the first major hurdle developers typically run into when building backbone applications with jquery mobile is that both frameworks have their own opinions about how to handle application navigation backbone s routers offer an explicit way to define custom navigation routes through backbone router whilst jquery mobile encourages the use of url hash fragments to reference separate pages or views in the same document jquery mobile also supports automatically pulling in external content for links through xhr calls meaning that there can be quite a lot of inter framework confusion about what a link pointing at and photo and id should actually be doing some of the solutions that have been previously proposed to work around this problem included manually patching backbone or jquery mobile i discourage opting for these techniques as it becomes necessary to manually patch your framework builds when new releases get made upstream using jquery mobile this can be done by setting mobile hashlisteningenabled false prior to initializing any of your other code the next question that arises is if we re preventing jquery mobile from listening to url hash changes how can we still get the benefit of being able to navigate to other sections in a document using the built in transitions and effects supported good question this can now be solve by simply calling code mobile changepage and code as follows var url about  effect slideup  reverse false changehash false mobile changepage url  transition effect  reverse changehash in the above sample code url and code can refer to a url or a hash identifier to navigate to code effect and code is simply the transition effect to animate the page in with and the final two parameters decide the direction for the transition code reverse and code and whether or not the hash in the address bar should be updated code changehash and code with respect to the latter i typically set this to false to avoid managing two sources for hash updates but feel free to set this to true if you re comfortable doing so strong namespacing and strong for this application i opted for the nested namespacing pattern implemented correctly this enables you to clearly identify if items being referenced in your app are views other modules and so on this initial structure is a sane place to also include application defaults unless you prefer maintaining those in a separate file window mobilesearch window mobilesearch and and views appview new appview routers workspace new workspace utils utils defaults resultsperpage  safesearch  maxdate  mindate  and  and  strong models and strong in the flickly application there are at least two unique types of data that need to be modelled search results and individual photos both of which contain additional meta data like photo titles if you simplify this down search results are actually groups of photos in their own right so the application only requires a single model a photo or result entry a result collection containing a group of result entries for search results a photo collection containing one or more result entries for individual photos or photos with more than one image strong views and strong the views we ll need include an application view a search results view and a photo view static views or pages of the single page application which do not require a dynamic element to them e g an about page can be easily coded up in your document s markup independant of backbone strong routers and strong a number of possible routes need to be taken into consideration basic search queries code search and kiwis and code search queries with additional parameters e g sort pagination code search and kiwis and srelevance and p and code queries for specific photos code photo and  and code a default route no parameters passed the majority of jqm apps i ve seen in production have been developed for the purpose of providing an optimal experience to users on mobile devices given that the framework was developed for this purpose there s nothing fundamentally wrong with this but many developers forget that jqm is a ui framework not dissimilar to jquery ui it s using the widget factory and is capable of being used for a lot more than we give it credit for if you open up flickly in a desktop browser you ll get an image search ui that s modelled on google com however review the components buttons text inputs tabs on the page for a moment the desktop ui doesn t look anything like a mobile application yet i m still using jqm for theming mobile components the tabs date picker sliders everything in the desktop ui is re using what jqm would be providing users on mobile devices thanks to some media queries the desktop ui can make optimal use of whitespace expanding component blocks out and providing alternative layouts whilst still making use of jqm as a component framework the benefit of this is that i don t need to go pulling in jquery ui separately to be able to take advantage of these features thanks to the recent themeroller my components can look pretty much exactly how i would like them to and users of the app can get a jqm ui for lower resolutions and a jqm ish ui for everything else the takeaway here is just to remember that if you re not already going through the hassle of conditional script and style loading based on screen resolution using matchmedia js etc  there are simpler approaches that can be taken to cross device component theming

3411707, there s a bunch of web deployment systems lately that use git for uploading applications i hate this deployments are not just a checkpoint in your application development they are also something that itself needs to be developed and tested when i use one of these systems i find myself with lots of this edit app conf git commit a m conf git push deploy that said git is not a bad file synchronization tool it s actually pretty darn fast faster than rsync because it keeps more state around rsync has to recheck the world each time and it gives you a nice history of what you ve done this command lets you use git like a sync tool separate from using it as your source control it s written as a git extension because whatever put git sync somewhere on your path you can call git sync or git sync you must then configure your git repository with a few commands where to upload to git config add sync default remote git deploymenthost com repo git kind of a scratch location to keep the files in git config add sync default repo git and sync now you can just run git sync and it will upload everything including uncommitted work it also uploads untracked files which maybe it shouldn t but files in gitignore should be ignored regardless you can also run a build step everytime you do a sync optional setting git config add sync default build tools and build now everytime you run git sync it will run the script in tools and build and upload the results you can use this to run a source compressor or whatever else you might want to do before an upload the results of your build will be committed and pushed the commad will be run with the current working directory of the files ready to be uploaded not your normal source repository if you want to leave files out of what gets sync d but still keep those files in your source repository create a file named syncignore similar to gitignore e g  put tools and into that file to keep your build tools from getting uploaded note in all these that default is a string you can change e g  you can make configuration values for production sync production remote and do git sync production you ll still have a nice set of history of what you ve uploaded though that history will be strictly per remote it won t be directly attached to your main repository but the commit messages will show the relation each commit has a commit log message deploying version where the version the output of git describe always dirty that command outputs the tag branch or if necessary just the latest revision of the repository the string dirty is appended when there is uncommitted work

4470085, dci data context interaction is a new way to look at object oriented programming instead of focusing on individual objects the dci paradigm focuses on communication between objects and makes it explicit it improves the readability of the code which helps programmers to reason about their programs i d been reading blogs posts and watching talks about dci for a long time and i felt that it s time to try it out i found that most material related to dci is theoretical there were a few books a dozen of blog posts and several presentations that could give you a good picture of what dci is however i could not find any real world examples of actually using it that s why i decided to write a simple application showing how to implement dci in ruby like the following projects the application is a rails project there are a few reasons for it all the dci concepts can be implemented in ruby it doesn t feel clunky or alien ruby is concise and readable even if you are a c programmer you should be able to understand what is going on there is more interest in dci in the ruby community than in any other community the application has been developed by victor savkin and rinaldi fonseca
2854428, i ve written multiple desktop apps from scratch there s a lot of repeated work that goes into doing it this is my attempt at a basic framework that will allow any project to get a running start it s built around a few assumptions and technology choices which should be suitable for most projects most code is written in c  targeted against version  of the net framework we assume all users will be running at least windows xp the installer is written using nsis we assume that updates should be done in the background with no ui or uac elevation prompts this framework comes from a project that is currently supporting over k users here is a breakdown of these technology choices you are free to change them to suit your application of course afterwards is a list of instructions for getting started with your particular project there are two main executables desktopbootstrap  and desktopbootstrapservice the first is the main client app which runs as the logged on user and sits in the windows system tray the service is a windows service which runs as system and is available to apply automatic updates or do other things as system users love software that gets better over time with no effort on their part our update mechanism is simple and secure most updates are applied by the windows service running as system so the user doesn t run into any uac elevation prompts the client app also runs update check code in case something gets broken in the service the update system assumes that any time is a good time for an updates which you ll need to modify if there s some user interaction that shouldn t be interrupted all update commands are signed using public key cryptography the updates are downloaded over plain http but their hashes are checked before execution the update public key is hard coded into the client the root ca system and all of its flaws are bypassed entirely there s a python script included makenew py that helps you generate your update key pairs the updater is based on an nsis script but could be any executable you generate it is responsible for killing the client app and and or stopping the windows service it then restarts the service but should not restart the client app since it s running as system the service then impersonates any users who were running the client and re launches the client app for each there is logging that s active at all times and logging that conditionally activates if certain registry values are present to activate the second kind of logging run debugflags reg after doing so all nsis scripts the installer uninstaller and updater will outputdebugstring various log messages use dbgview exe or a similar app to read log and filter them to your heart s content those registry flags also turn on outputdebugstring for client and service logging otherwise on all installs log files are written and rotated using nlog see log cs for more each install is given a clientguid which is kind of like a cookie that lives in the registry it s fairly brittle but is a basic  and  for being able to identify users across web requests to your various web services if you need anything more robust i d recommend a user account system other than update keys you should consider authenticode keys and you ll need to generate a new strong signing key pair the build system assumes you ll put your authenticode keys in the client and deployment and authenticodekey folder i d recommend using an authenticode key for anything other than a quick hobby app we ll walk through generating your own assembly strong signing keys as well using sn first download the project to your machine cd into that directory run python customize py yourprojectname yourprojectname should not include any spaces this will rename everything that says desktopbootstrap to use yourprojectname first we ll generate new strong signing keys cd into yourprojectname and client sn k yourprojectnamestrongsignkeys snk you may have to locate sn if it s not in your path it should be in your visual studio bin folder now we ll generate auto update keys cd and tools and keys and selfsigned rename yourprojectnameclientupdatekey yourprojectnameclientupdatekeybackup this folder is mostly there to give a flavor of what the keys look like we won t need it before you run the makenew python script make sure you have openssl in your path you can test this by running openssl version python makenew py yourprojectnameclientupdatekey this script creates two update key pairs prod  and test prod is generated first followed by test note the line saying now doing type prod for prod  you ll need to pick a passphrase used to encrypt your private key let s assume it s tutu the script will ask you to provide your passphrase several times i counted four tutu s followed by the certificate parameters which really don t matter  followed by the challenge password must be blank  followed by two tutu s followed by the name of you p file yourprojectname prod the first time around then yourprojectname test the second time around  followed by two more tutu s for your test key pair i d recomment test as your passphrase if you weren t comfortable doing this the first time around just blast away the key directory and run it again i m sorry about all the run around in the script there are lots of commands because we need each key in several representations to make all the moving pieces work together god help you if you want to use one of these key pairs in java email me for java key store instructions now securely delete all of the files in the new folder hierarchy that say deleteme and finally copy and paste the certificate pem file contents of each of prod and test into the relevant sections at the bottom of client and sharedsource and updatechecker cs ensure that an instance of visual studio is running on your machine this is needed for dotfuscator cd into client and deployment and installer visual studio will build your solution then you ll see dotfuscator pop up wait for the splash screen to go away hit the play button on the toolbar wait for obfuscation to finish then close dotfuscator you ll see nant continue its thing builds end up in the builds directory change something small about the app we re going to build and publish an update assuming you re still in the installer directory run nant as before this will produce build  note that the updater is designed to be ran by the service as system in session  so while you can double click it its behavior will be a little off from ideal you need some way to tell the client about the update this is done through an xml file that lists the executable location and hash this xml file is signed using the update key pair we just generated to generate this xml file launch yourprojectnameupdatesigner in visual studio the update signer app tries to guess the updater location the download url private key etc enter the password for your prod update key tutu from above click go assuming it says done  you can close it now it created a file called yourprojectnameupdateinfo xml in the latest build directory if you ever want to change that url edit client and sharedsource and updatechecker cs  but you won t need to do that for this exercise on your test machine change your windows hosts file to redirect updates yourprojectname com to     and then we ll use tools and fakeupdateserver to serve up the xml let s walk through that first copy fakeupdateserver exe and the update info xml file to your test machine s desktop start fakeupdateserver exe as an administrator so it can listen on port  make sure the xml file path in the app points to the update xml file you copied over you can ignore the exe path part it can be used to serve the updater executable but we put it on a public internet server which is in some ways simpler make sure the updates via service checkbox is checked and that the other is not this indicates that the windows service should get the update command rather than the client app add a string registry value under hkeylocalmachine software wownode yourprojectname  named immediateupdatecheck  and set its value to true while you re at it add the debugflags reg values and open dbgview exe  so you can see the update happen it s pretty fun to watch now using the services app under administrator tools restart the yourprojectnameservice service the logging is pretty verbose ten seconds after you restart the service it will check for an update the fakeupdateserver will send the update command xml the service will download the updater verify its hash and run it the updater will shut down the service and client app update all files and relaunch the service the service will relaunch the client app the whole process will take about thirty seconds you can verify that the update happened by right clicking on yourprojectname exe in program files x  going to properties  then the details tab the version should now be     despite its name and poor design fakeupdateserver has been successfully serving updates to over  clients you can edit the eula which is shown during the installer by replacing client and deployment and installer and license rtf you can edit your application s icon by replacing tools and artwork and icon and app ico but you ll also have to go into visual studio and replace the parallel copies in each project s properties  and in trayiconform s trayicon just don t build desktop apps unless it s required for your application and unless your application is a compelling one it s always better to update your personal toolchain and explore new applications than exploit current skills even where desktop apps are necessary a c framework might be the wrong choice os x is on the rise and a framework built on top of python c and and  or a more portable language might be preferable please just don t use adobe air and if you end up building a desktop app in a portable language please factor out your app specific logic and publish desktopbootstrap and and

comment starts with a character and ends with a line break a unit of execution is called a chunk syntactically a chunk is simply a block hue handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function as such chunks can define local symbols chunks can also be pre compiled a block is a list of expressions which are executed sequentially where the last expression in the block denotes the result value of the block itself block expression and expressions can be separated either by their natural boundaries or by line feeds new lines  in which case the indentation level is significant example here a b

mongo mongo proxies all the collection methods defined on the driver plus some custom methods this allows mongolia to extend the driver with extra functionalties namespacing allows you to filter the

4464743, the recent emergence of the websocket protocol has given developers a new tool to deploy dynamic real time connections and content between the client and server unfortunately the tedious http request and response model that was designed to facilitate the the internet s early role as a distributed static file system has been folded into most libraries that support this new protocol in order to write a functional real time web application a programmer must first learn these older protocols as well as the associated syntax for initializing a server establishing socket connections and other verbose functions associated with the traditional client server architecture joint takes care of this repetitive boilerplate configuration automatically so that the programmer can immediately begin work on the main application logic the entire network architecture is abstracted into a few intuitive functions that facilitate seamless communication between server and client joint also allows functions on the server to be called like any other function on the client and vice versa moreover once these connections are established joint provides convenient functions to help organize search through and keep track of them joint requires node js and npm once you have these dependencies simply npm install joint g to give a peek at the power and simplicity of joint we first present a simple connection logger our logger program will write to stdout when a new user connects joint allows us to write functions on the server which can be called from the client html as if they were included in the client side code these functions run on the server but in a bit we ll show you how easy it is to get the results back in the client the following two lines are the entire code listing for our logger js program var server server arrive function name console log name and arrived module exports server the first line creates the server object the server object contains methods to be called by the client next the assignment maps the key arrive to a function that prints the client s name to stdout lastly we always export the server object to be used by joint the client side code in our modified index html will import joint s client side library pass js  and call the function we just defined on our server the full code listing is as follows script pass connect function server server arrive prompt  hi what s your name   and script the script pass js is automatically generated and served by the joint server including it and calling pass connect passes functions in the server dictionary to the client so that we can call arrive in the client side javascript the connection function takes a callback function with server as an argument this function is called when the connection is successfully established before arrive is called the user will be prompted to enter their name as the argument so that we know who they are on the server with this index html in the static directory we can have the server start listening on port  just as we did in the previous example joint logger js  static joint logger js  static activity log we ve created a simple activity logger with just five lines of server code one could imagine extending this example to collect analytics about user activity in real time for instance perhaps each button press in a single page web app could be logged in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a user interface hopefully the last example illuminated the power and ease of exposing server side functions to client side scripts but joint isn t just for one way communication to show just how useful joint can be for real time bidirectional client server interactions we now present a simple chat server the chat server will allow clients to broadcast messages to all registered users in our application when a client application connects to the server it registers with a callback function to let the server know how to contact it when a client sends a message the server iterates through all connected clients calling the callback function that was passed to it by each connection the code listing for our new chat js file is shown below var joint require joint var server server arrive function msgcallback this conn onmsg msgcallback server broadcast function msg joint conns map function c c onmsg msg module exports server the first function takes a single argument msgcallback that is added as a value to the dictionary conn with key  onmsg like server  this conn is a special object joint maintains a conn object for each client connection this object is intended to store client specific information such as a usernames and callbacks the this conn may be used within the body of an exposed server function to reference the object of the client that invoked the function here we register a callback function by which the joint program can send a message back to the client notice that functions can be assigned or passed as function arguments just as a string or number can be the second function also takes a single argument msg which is a string to send to all other connected clients the built in function conns returns an array containing all of the conn objects for connected clients here we use conns map to call the onmsg callback on each client finally we again export the server object to be used by joint the bare bones gui will consist of a text input box and a submit button when the submit button is clicked the client will broadcast the string in the text box then clear the text box the full code listing for the client file index html is below input id msginput input type submit onclick send script var inputbox document getelementbyid msginput var send pass connect function server send function server broadcast inputbox value and and broadcast input inputbox value and and clear text box  function rcv msg console log msg  server arrive rcv and and register rev callback  and script we assume basic familiarity with javascript and html but again there are a few important lines specific to joint that the reader should note namely the first script tag includes the client side pass js file which gives access to server functions inside of pass connect s callback this program can be run in the same matter as the previous example try opening the page in two browser windows and watch as your chat instantly appears in the console of one after you send it from the other an astute reader may have noticed that our server functions never return values rather they are written in a continuation passing style a callback function is passed to the server which passes results as arguments to the callback function when it is done with the computation this style which should be familiar to javascript programmers who have written event oriented user interfaces has a number of advantages for instance without return values it impossible to make blocking calls to the server as a quick exercise consider the difference between the following two javascript snippets and and snippet  var x hardwork console log ready for more work and and snippet  hardworkasync function result x result console log ready for more work can you predict the difference in output the first piece of code will block on the first line waiting for hardwork to return a value for the assignment before it prints to the console in the second snippet x is instantiated then hardworkasync is called with a callback function as an argument however the interpreter does not wait for the function to complete or the assignment to occur before immediately printing to the console in this way control flow is synchronous but function calls are asynchronous since javascript executes on single threads waiting for a value to return from a function call will inevitable block the next statement from being executed this is especially apparent with the remote function calls due to the reality of network latency you re probably wondering how we can write such an application in a reasonable amount of lines and without tedious implementation of lots of data structures client grouping is usually a critical component when building scalable web applications conveniently this functionality is provided by the joint library first we create an exposed function that serves two purposes it subscribes the client to the specified channel and stores the client s handler for receiving messages in the client connection dictionary we subscribe a client to a group through the use of the pushtag function which takes two arguments the conn dictionary of the client and the group name a string server subscribe function channel onmsg joint pushtag this conn channel this conn onmsg onmsg we then create an exposed function that allows a client to publish a message to a channel server publish function message channel conns channel map function c c onmsg message  you ve seen the conns function before when called with no parameter it returns an array of all client conn dictionaries when a group name is provided as a parameter it returns the array of client conn dictionaries that are tagged with the group name also note that with the above implementation of publish  we have the option to not specify a channel in which case the function broadcasts to all open channels on the server finally we can unsubscribe a client from a specified channel or if no channel is specified all channels to which the client is subscribed we do this by calling the poptag function as shown server unsubscribe function channel if channel poptag this conn channel else channels this conn map function c poptag this conn c  with these functions we have written a fully functional publish subscribe server in under  lines of javascript hopefully this tutorial has given you a good feel for what kinds of applications are best suited for joint and how few lines of code are required to build them with some luck you should be able to have a simple application of your own up and running in just minutes we hope you will enjoy using joint as much as we enjoyed designing it
5186760, shield a security minded microframework  in my efforts to learn more about security best practices in php i noticed that most of the php frameworks out there left it up to the developer to correctly handle input and output and etc themselves unfortunately this has been a sticking point in php apps so i decided to work on a microframework that was designed with security in mind this project is under a mit license disclaimer  please note this framework is a work in progress and is serving as a resource to learn more about php and web application security use of this framework will not provide the perfect security for your application nor should it be considered an ultimate resource for security best practices output filtering on all values preventing xss logging on all actions input filtering functionality for accessing all superglobal information uses php s own filtering for data sanitization encrypted session handling rijndael and mcryptmodecbc uses iv custom cookie handling including httponly customized error handling to avoid exposing filesystem information basic templating and view system ip based access control session fixation prevention  php   x mcrypt extension for sessions  i m a big fan of the slim microframework so anyone that s used that will feel at home with shield here s some example code of it in use includeonce and shield and shield php app new shield shield app get and function echo website root woo app run the above example is super simple all it does is handle thanks to the included htaccess file the request for the root level route and as a get request when it matches the route it executes the closure callback and echos out website root woo easy right let s take a look at something a bit more complicated to introduce you to a few other handy tools at your disposal includeonce and shield and shield php app new shield shield app get and function use app app filter add test  email return app view render index test app run first off there s one key difference between this example and the first one in this example we pass in the app object itself so we have access to some special features here s a quick overview app view an instance of the view object that can be used to do some more complex view handling app filter a filtering object that lets you add and execute filters on the given data app input a feature to pull in values from the php superglobals get post etc app log a logging instance what the framework uses too app config access to the configuration options reading and writing there s also one other thing that could help in more complex development the di container the framework makes heavy use of a dependency injection container dic to work with its resources this is exposed back to the user as well so you can access app di and use it to manage your own object instances as well regular expression routing  besides the ability for shield to match exact routes like and foo  there s also a feature included allowing you use regular expresions in your routing for example includeonce and shield and shield php app new shield shield app get and foo   and  function matches printr matches shield will try to match exact routes first but then fall back on the regex routing checks in th eabove example we re matching a route like and foo you ll notice that the first argument for the method is the routing matches as want to use and have the values returned to you in the matches value so includeonce and shield and shield php app new shield shield app get and foo   and  function matches printr matches you would get array   in the matches variable you can also use named parameters in your routes too includeonce and shield and shield php app new shield shield app get and params and t and t  function matches return app view render first parameter matches t if your route is and params and  and  you ll get array t  t  in the matches variable note do not directly use the values from this array there is currently no filtering on these values so there is potential for exploitation bound configuration  you can also specify some configuration options linked directly to the route and closure combination here s an example includeonce and shield and shield php app new shield shield app get and xml  function use app return app view render test this is xml and test  array view content type text and xml in the above example we re overriding the view content type setting but only for the and route not everything this gives us a bit more control over the application making it easier to customize the request handling note this uses the dot notation to specify the value the key most configuration options should be available for reconfiguration via this method documentation  the shield class is the main class you ll use and really only has a handful of methods run execute the application no parameters each of the routing methods like get and post two parameters route and closure and callback access the values loaded from the configuration file or set and read your own set keyname value set a configuration value get keyname get a configuration value load path load the values from the path into the app overwrites  default looks for config php getconfig get all of the config options as an array setconfig configarr set the array of options to the configuration overwrites access to the dependency injection container getting setting register obj alias register an object in the container alias is optional uses classname as name if not defined get name get the object with the given name from the container filter values based on filter types supported are email striptags filters are applied when get is called add fieldname type add a filter of the type when the fieldname is fetched filter fieldname value looks for the filter s on the object and executes them in order fifo on the value note if no filters are specified it will execute a striptags on the data by default the type parameter for the add method can either be a string for the filter type or it can be a closure that will be given the value of the field as a parameter for example app filter add myfield  function value return returned value you must be sure to return from this closure otherwise the filtering will return null pull values from the php superglobals filtered get name pull from the get name is name of variable post name pull from the post name is name of the variable request name pull from the request name is name of the variable files name pull from the files name is the name of the variable server name pull from the server name is the name of the variable set type name value push a value into the property name of type session  get  post etc note superglobals are unset following a creation of an input object logging to a file log msg level message to log to the file level is optional default info handle output to the page set name value sets a variable into the view to be replaced in a template render content renders and returns the content any variables set to the object are replaced using the notation name note all values are escaped and filtered by default to prevent xss this can be overridden if desired a basic templating engine included in the framework by default it looks for a file named with the string given in views and or falls back to a strreplace method treating it as a string render template either the name of the template file no php or the string to use as a template note if you choose to use the string as a template no file  you must use the varname notation to get the values to substitute values can be set directly to the template instance ex app view template test foo configuration  an optional config php file can be placed in the same root as your front controller probably index php so it can be found by the framework this configuration file is a php array returned with your settings these values can be accessed through the di get config get method call here s an example config return array logpath and tmp additionally you can use a dotted notation to find configuration options so for example to find the value below return array foo array bar array baz testing this  you can use app config get foo bar baz to get the value testing this logpath set the default logging path session path set the path on the local filesystem to save the session files to session key customize the key used for the session encryption session lock enable and disable session locking binds session to the ip and user agent to help prevent fixation allowedhosts array of hosts allowed to make requests whitelisting forcehttps allows you to force the use of https will redirect if enabled and http is detected how to contribute  first off thanks for considering submitting changes for the project help is always appreciated if you re going to contribute to the project here s a few simple steps to follow when contributing please make a branch on your clone of the repo and commit your changes there this makes it much simpler when the time comes to merge submit a pull request with good detail on what changed reading through code is fun but a summary is better contact information is below feel free to email or send a message on github if you have questions shield and the owasp top ten  a injection all user input is filtered with at least one filter including all php superglobals a cross site scripting before any information is accessed it is passed through at least one filter additionally you can provide custom filtering via closures a broken authentication session management all session information is encrypted as it is stored using a rijdael  method with an initialization vector a insecure direct object references currently there s no permissioning system and no auth system in the framework a cross site request forgery currently not prevented a security misconfiguration the framework checks different php configuration settings to ensure that common security issues are mitigated a insecure cryptographic storage as previously mentioned the only storage the framework does sessions stores the values encrypted a failure to restrict url access included in the framework is the ability to restrict based on ip more fine grained restriction is coming soon a insufficient transport layer protection the framework currently does not prevent the use of http over https a unvalidated redirects forwards the framework does not provide a mechanism for redirecting and forwarding  chris cornutt ccornutt

run your rack app on it adapters enable momentum to act as a proxy to your existing http backend and should you want to you can also run your rack app in seperate threads installation  installation is quite complicated at the moment as there is no gem release yet first clone this repo and dependencies git clone git and and github com and jonasschneider and momentum git cd momentum git submodule update init bundle install then go ahead and run the proxy example bundle exec ruby examples and proxy rb  this will start momentum on      with the proxy adapter see below  forwarding all requests to an http server running on port  if you have a recent version of chrome and chromium use the command line flag use spdy no ssl to force it to use spdy point it at yourserver   and bam you re running spdy for more usage examples see the examples and directory as momentum is rack based the server will deliver all requests to a rack app this rack app is the argument to momentum start the simplest possible solution is to just use your regular rack app with the momentum backend spdy requests to your app will cause your application code to be executed in the spdy server itself but you probably don t want this for several reasons first as your app is most likely not asynchronous the event loop of the spdy server will be blocked when running your app s code this can cause timeouts and will effectively make your spdy sever synchronous second spdy is meant as a front end protocol running your app on a front end server will break when you need to scale the recommended solution is simple keep your existing http infrastructure and backend servers and use momentum as a proxy to your backend servers as described in the usage example above add the following to your app s gemfile gem momentum  git git and and github com and jonasschneider and momentum git  submodules true then download the code and start the server by running bundle install bundle exec momentum this will start momentum running your config ru with the defer adapter this adapter see below will run your application code in a separate thread per request so make sure it s threadsafe if you re curious you can try out what happens without an adapter running your app directly in the event loop no threads by running momentum plain in your app s directory adapters are rack apps they can be thought of as middleware if you do not want your app to be executed within the spdy server event loop i e because it blocks  you should use an adapter the design of adapters is to return an async response immediately so the event loop of the spdy server is not blocked of course the adapter has to get the real response from somewhere the adapters use mechanisms that are provided by eventmachine to generate or fetch the response asynchronously the proxy adapter will cause all requests to be forwarded to a given http server the spdy server will act as an http proxy internally em httprequest is used to asynchronously fetch the resource from the backend advanced features of the spdy protocol such as server push currently cannot be used as they would require communication betweeen the backend and the spdy server before the response is sent trivial performance tests showed that using the proxy adapter in combination with a thin and nginx setup yields the best results for serving clients over the internet for sites with many assets see below note that is is not a spdy and https proxy for proxying connections to arbitrary servers way of providing the spdy protocol to clients without any backend configuration changes defer will use the eventmachine thread pool configured with a size of  to run your application code this requires your code to be threadsafe this adapter is used when running the momentum command server push see below is possible with this adapter backwards compatibility is important http clients should be handled by a slave http server that forwards requests to the master spdy server http support for the spdy server is a work in progress taking advantage of spdy server push  a momentum appdelegate object is available in env spdy when running on momentum the public api for this object currently consists of just one method push url it should be called when the app can safely determine that the resource at path is going to be required to render the page however you should not rely on env spdy being available in order to stay compatible to regular rack servers using it requires the defer adapter if you are not running on it calling push will result in a no op if you are calling push url will initiate a spdy server push to the client the spdy server will be informed of the app s push request and will start processing the request immediately as if was sent as a separate request by the client per the spdy spec the virtual request will look to the application completely identical to the original request except for the host  scheme and path headers and also url to stay compatible to the current chromium implementation  which contain the location of the requested resource performance  this project is somewhat in development since one of the main goals of spdy is to improve loading times performance is considered vital for momentum i performed some totally unscientific performance tests the app in question is located in examples and lotsofimages ru it displays a bare bones html page which in turn loads  thumbnail sized jpeg images from the server loading times were measured using the chrome dom inspector reading the time of the domcontentloaded event which indicates the arrival of the main html document and the onload event which indicates that all of the images have been loaded traditional benchmark approaches using tools like ab are deemed inappropriate because spdy is not optimized for raw request benchmarking but instead focuses on the results given by real browsers besides that there is no ab equivalent for spdy high concurrency benchmarks are therefore still to be done to test spdy chrome was started with the use spdy no ssl flag which forces chrome to talk spdy everywhere this means that tls spdy negotiation is not included in the benchmark for testing the http servers chrome was started without command line flags the first smaller group of tests was performed over a local network the server was running on a media center style box under debian for the second group of tests a small amazon ec instance was fired up the results of the two test groups should not be cross compared as the system specs differ vastly thead th nbsp and th th domcontentloaded and th th onload and th and thead tbody and tbody over a local connection the advantage of the single connection is negated by the protocol overhead making the multi connection approach much faster additional tests were therefore ommited but over a remote connection the results look drastically different as can be seen the high performant servers thin and unicorn are meant to be run behind a reverse proxy there they achieve great loading times measuring subsequent requests showed that no speedup was gained those results are ommited the momentum tests were performed on both initial and subsequent tests to show the improvement caused by the held spdy connection the simplicity of the defer makes it faster than the proxy adapter in front of thin sadly testing the proxy adapter with unicorn behind nginx was forgotten therefore the best results were achieved with the defer adapter and the proxy adapter proxying to nginx which in turn proxies to thin this is surprising given the overhead of the multiple proxies but shows the power that lies in the simple addition of a spdy server to an existing nginx and thin configuration and probably also unicorn and nginx the test may seem biased as the amount of assets to be loaded is quite high which favors spdy for future investigation different asset file sizes should be considered especially larger stylesheet and javascript files compliance  momentum is meant to be compliant with version  of the spdy spec released under the mit license copyright c   jonas schneider

1536923, routemap js  url mapping library for client side and server side js routemap maps url patterns to methods it is written in plain old javascript and can be used in conjunction with any other libraries it does however require javascript   array methods such as map  filter  reduce  etc if these methods do not exist it will throw an error can be added to any environment to back port these functions if they don t already exist in the browser the typical use case is for mapping url fragments window location hash to javascript methods by default routemap handler is not associated with any event if the environment it will be used in supports a window onhashchange event then binding routemap handler to it will work out of the box if not a simple url polling function can be used instead similarly if the environment supports the html history api the onpopstate event can be bound hashbang  the url patterns routemap uses are based on a file system path analogy so all patterns must begin with a and character in order to support the must begin with and  a prefix can be specified the default prefix value is but if you want your site to be indexed you can switch the prefix to be routemap prefix directives  routes added to routemap can be static urls or they can have dynamic components that get parsed and passed into their respective methods inside an arguments dictionary there are three basic types of directives consider the rule routemap add route and users and id  method users get id can be any scalar value as long as it does not contain a and character so for example the url and users and  would cause users get to be invoked with one argument id  an unnamed token can be followed by a character to indicate it is optional but no other unnamed parameter can follow an optional unnamed parameter because that would lead to ambiguous urls routemap add route and users and id and fave  method users get and and works routemap add route and users and id and fave and other  method users get and and throws an error routemap add route and users and id and fave and other  method users get and and also throws an error named tokens of rule expressions are different from unnamed tokens in that they can appear anywhere in a url because they are key and value pairs their order can be arbitrary here is an example routemap add route and users and id  method users get notice that the colon comes after the token name id a matching url for this rule would look like and users and id  routemap will automatically url encode and decode values when generating urls and parsing them star directives act like a sieve normally if a url matches a pattern but has extraneous parameters then it is not considered a match and routemap will not fire that pattern s handler but if a star directive exists at the end of the rule like in these examples routemap add route and users and id and  method users get routemap add route and users and id and extras  method users gettwo then urls with extraneous information like and users and  and somethingelse and goes here will still match in the case of the rules above the following function calls will fire users get id   and somethingelse and goes here users gettwo id   extras and somethingelse and goes here however star directives are not exactly wildcards they may not preserve the order of the extraneous items in a url they will always put all of the unnamed extra pieces of a url before the named pieces so if the url and users and  and goes here and somethingelse is accessed the arguments will still be exactly as they are above client side sample  in a browser environment routemap can be used as is here are some samples and and assumes jquery exists and we are using a modern ish browser that supports onhashchange and and but jquery is not necessary to use routemap just shown here for event handling function var routes window routemap rules rule and and add some rules rules loadmain route and  method load  loadfoomain route and foo  method loadfoomain  loadfoo route and foo and id  method loadfoo  for rule in rules if rules hasownproperty rule routes add rules rule and and set up window listener and initial fire window bind hashchange  routes handler routes handler and and in addition to binding hash change events to window also fire it onload the previous example assumes that loadmain  loadfoomain  and loadfoo all exist in the global window window loadmain function args and and do some work args is an empty object window loadfoomain function args and and do some work args is an empty object window loadfoo function args and and do some work args is an object that has id in it typically you may not want to pollute the global namespace so routemap allows changing the context in which it looks for rules methods the above examples could for example work like this and and assumes jquery exists and we are using a modern ish browser that supports onhashchange and and however we could be using any other library or no library and we could create a hash polling function etc function var routes window routemap rules rule and and add some rules rules loadmain route and

huge base of available plugins and graphite s excellent graphing capabilities it sends collectd data directly to your graphite server interface tool written by the prolific engineer jordan sissel at loggly jordan s implementation uses an external process to bridge collectd to graphite i did not want another process to manage or worry about so i wrote a plugin for collectd requirements  option to

760802, tamale is a lua library for structural pattern matching kind of like regular expressions for arbitrary data structures  not just strings or sinatra for data structures rather than urls tamale matcher reads a rule table and produces a matcher function the table should list pattern result rules which are structurally compared in order against the input the matcher returns the result for the first successful rule or nil match failed if none match require tamale local v tamale var local m tamale matcher foo    one   function return two end  bar     three  baz  v x  v x  v x is a variable add  v x  v y  function cs return cs x and cs y end  print m foo   one print m  two print m bar    three print m baz  four four print m add     print m sub    nil match failed the result can be either a literal value number string etc  a variable a table or a function functions are called with a table containing the original input and captures if any its result is returned variables in the result standalone or in tables are replaced with their captures and declarative aka data driven programming is easy to locally reason about maintain and debug and structures do not need to be manually unpacked pattern variables automatically capture the value from their position in the input and it fits or it doesn t fit the contract that code is expected to follow is very clear and rule tables can be compiled down to search trees which are potentially more efficient than long nested if and switch statements tamale currently does not do this but could in the future without any change to its interface also see indexing below imperative code to rebalance red black trees can get pretty hairy with pattern matching the list of transformations is the code create red black tags and local pattern variables local rbaxbyczd r  b  v a  v x  v b  v y  v c  v z  v d local balanced r b a x b  y b c z d  balance tamale matcher b r r a x b  y c  z d  balanced  b r a x r b y c  z d  balanced  b a x r r b y c  z d  balanced  b a x r b y r c z d  balanced  v body  v body  default case keep the same adapted from chris okasaki s purely functional data structures particularly recommended the art of prolog by leon sterling ehud shapiro programming erlang by joe armstrong each rule has the form pattern  result  when function the pattern can be a literal value table or function for tables every field is checked against every field in the input and those fields may in turn contain literals variables tables or functions functions are called on the input s corresponding field if the function s first result is non false the field is considered a match and all results are appended to the capture table see below if the function returns false or nil the match was a failure tamale p marks strings as patterns that should be compared with string match possibly returning captures  rather than as a string literal use it like p aaa bbb  result its entire implementation is just function p str return function v if type v string then return string match v str end end rules also have two optional keyword arguments this is used to add further restrictions to a rule such as a rule that can only take strings which are also valid e mail addresses the function is passed the captures table isvalid cs checks cs  p  registeraddress when isvalid this flag allows a table pattern to match an table input value which has more fields that are listed in the pattern tag leaf  somefun partial true could match against any table that has the value t tag leaf  regardless of any other fields the patterns specified in tamale rules can have variables which capture the contents of that position in the input to create a tamale variable use tamale var x which can potentially aliased as v x  if you re into the whole brevity thing variable names can be any string though any beginning with  are ignored during matching i e  v   v   v x  v  will capture the third value from any four value array variable names are not required to be uppercase it s just a convention from prolog and erlang also note that declaring local variables for frequently used tamale variables can make rule tables cleaner compare local x y z v x  v y  v z m tamale matcher x x    capitalization helps to keep x y    the tamale vars distinct from x y z    the lua vars m tamale matcher v x  v x    v x  v y    v x  v y  v z    the  example above could be reduced to   x  finally when the same variable appears in multiple fields in a rule pattern such as x y x  each repeated field must structurally match its other occurrances x y x would match     but not    the function tamale matcher takes a rule table and returns a matcher function the matcher function takes one or more arguments the first is matched against the rule table and any further arguments are saved in captures args the rule table also takes a couple other options which are described below tamale defaults to structural comparison of tables but sometimes tables are used as identifiers e g sentinel the rule table can have an optional argument of ids list of ids  for values that should still be compared by rather than structure otherwise all such ids would match each other and any empty table indexing in tamale is like indexing in relational databases rather than testing every single rule to find a match only those in the index need to be tested often this singlehandedly eliminates most of the rules by default the rules are indexed by the first value when the rule table tamale matcher  a     b     c     d    is matched against  d  it only needs one test if the rule table is indexed by the first field the fourth rule is the only one starting with  to specify a different index than pattern   give the rule table a keyword argument of index i  where i is either another key such as  or tag  or a function if a function is used each rule will be indexed by the result of applying the function to it for example with the rule table tamale matcher a  b      index ab a  c      index ac b  a      index ba b  c      index bc index function rule return rule  rule  end each rule will be indexed based on the first two fields concatenated rather than just the first an input value of a  c   would only need to check the second row not the first indexing should never change the results of pattern matching just make the matcher function do less searching note that an indexing function needs to be deterministic indexing by say os time will produce weird results an argument of index false turns indexing off tamale has several debugging traces they can be enabled either by spetting tamale debug to true or adding debug true as a keyword argument to a rule table matching a  c   against tamale matcher a  b      a  c      b  a      b  c      index function rule return rule  rule  end debug true will print rule  indexing on index t ab rule  indexing on index t ac rule  indexing on index t ba rule  indexing on index t bc checking rules  trying rule  matched this can be used to check whether indexing is effective if one rule is pre empting another etc

full url and the request method get post put or delete to provide a very flexible option for defining a restful interface to redis by default the module returns an xml representation of the resulting redis response for example configuring a redisalias to support the ping command redisalias ping ping  the response would be xml version   encoding utf  response status pong and status and response this behavior can be altered by appending json to the url for example status pong alternatively appending jsonp and adding a query parameter  callback respond with callback status pong installation

testing directory by default the test script will attempt to connect to local redis server on the standard redis port   this can be modified with command line parameters and test sh redisipaddress redisport redisalias directive  description defines a rule to match a url to a redis command syntax redisalias teststring rediscommandpattern method rules are matched based on the order in which they are defined depending on the expression care should be taken not to define less specific expressions before more specific ones consider a configuraton defining two directives in the following order in the following example the second expression would never be matched because the first expression would evaluate successfully first redisalias and and get  redisalias ping pong teststring a regular expression defining the elements in the url to match this excludes the protocol hostname portnumber module location and query string consider an local installation of apache with modredis handler configured for the location and redis and  in the following contrived example the element of the url that can be matched against is in square brackets round brackets can used used to create a backreference for part of the matching string which can be later referenced in the rediscommandpattern this is essential to extract elements of the url for use in the redis command itself and and and count this example matches any characters appearing before the first matching forward slash followed by a forward slash the word count and then the end of the string the round brackets create a backreference capturing the characters before the forward slash so that it can be used in the rediscommandpattern i e zcard  using this example the url host and handler and myset and count would result in the redis command zcard myset rediscommandspattern the pattern used to create a redis command to be executed the format of this command must confirm to the redis command syntax additionally the text can contain the following teststring backreferences these backreferences take the form n  n  which provide to the grouped parts in parentheses of the teststring request variables these are variables from the current request being processed data the body content of a put or post request form field the value of a form field taken from put or post request the request must have include the content type header as application and x www form urlencoded qsa field the value of a query string argument taken from the request url method the http method of the given request get put post or delete when a method is not specified get is assumed as the default the method parameter can be used to increase the specificity of the directive in the following example the teststring is identical however the method determines which directive would successfully match redisalias and and get  redisalias and and set  data put redisalias and and del  delete examples to define alias to add remove

contains classes that help you distribute the code e g plugins skins to remote php applications over http and thanks to signing remove the risk of arbitraty remote code execution in those applications if you re not interested in remote deployment you could always use included command line utilities to help you deal with phar archives license mit command line utilities  phar build for building and signing phar archives phar extract for extracting and listing contents of phar archive phar verify for verifying signature of phar archive phar generate cert for generating openssl certificates used to sign the phar archives phar file checksums for generating and checking files checksum to see if phar archive is up to date with source files all scripts support h command line parameter to display their usage installation  php    phar    if you re using php    phar is already bundled for older versions e g under ubuntu these steps are required to build and enable the phar extension sudo apt get install php dev sudo pecl install pecl and phar echo extension phar so and sudo tee and etc and php and conf d and phar ini to be able to build phar archives you need to change php ini setting phar readonly  under ubuntu this is done by executing echo phar readonly  and sudo tee a and etc and php and conf d and phar ini this step is optional and discouraged if you will only be reading phar archives install the library through pear installer sudo pear channel discover pear kotowicz net sudo pear install kotowicz and pharutil beta generate certificates in cert and directory will be put in priv pem and pub pem mkdir cert and cd cert and phar generate cert create src and directory and copy all the files to build the archive from there build a signed phar archive phar build phar library

util in a build script  thanks to damian bushong stratosphere dot programming at gmail dot com  phar util now comes with a script used to generate file checksums in phar archive and compare them with source file checksums to see if a phar archive needs to be rebuilt thanks to using exit codes this can be easily used in your app build scripts use phar file checksums help command for instructions secure remote code deployment with pharutil  developer have a certain limitation when it comes to their security although standard phar file can be signed the key used to verify the signature i e the public key must be stored alongside the archive moreover the signature verification process is hardcoded and does not allow you to supply the public key by yourself these problems make it difficult to use phar archives to distribute a trusted code to clients because the code and public key have to be stored on the server attacker could use e g dns spoofing to emulate the server and supply the code without any signature or using his own public key because of that standard phar extension does not allow including remote e g http and and phar archives to avoid the the risk of arbitrary remote code execution see e g allowurlfopen and allowurlinclude discussion to overcome this problem the pharutil library recommends using a different approach the key used to verify the signature is stored on a client shared secret and is never transferred over the wire all code is downloaded to the local client sandbox and is verifed using the stored key after verification the code can by safely included for a more detailed view of different methods of including remote code see and why should you care at all  with pharutil the usage scenario is as follows on server publisher  create public and private keys with open ssl phar generate cert  on a server build a code phar build and sign it using your private key you may use the built archive on a server like any other phar archive see example and local php on client consumer  bundle a copy of public key cert and pub pem for signature verification  download a phar archive from the server  verify phar signature using local copy of public key to be sure that the code has been generated by trusted entity  include and run the phar archive in your application  see example and remote php or the example below mentioned files are installed in example subdirectory of pear package documentation e g and usr and share and php and docs and pharutil and example disclaimer for the security of given method it is critical to never disclose the private key this method also doesn t protect anyone from looking at the code the code is not encrypted it is only signed so it cannot be changed by third party use pharutilremotepharverifier class to securely check for the phar signature before using the archive php and and all verified phars will be copied to lib and directory verifier new pharutilremotepharverifier and tmp  and lib  and cert and

214298, clojure like emacs  note changes to the monad library regarding scope have broken tons of code temporarily this is a group of loosely organized utilities to add clojure like abilities to emacs lisp it consists of defn and fn forms for declaring functions and anonymous functions these forms support the usual clojure style destructuring bind and arity based dispatch on function arguments another macro dlet implements destructuring bind for let all of them are lexically scoped rather than the emacs default dynamic scope despite this a defn function is an emacs function and can be declared interactive defn fn dlet examples  these work in a manner similar to the clojure equivalents require defn defn f x x x y x y f   f    this defines a function of one or two arguments when the function is called the correct body is invoked based on arity while emacs lacks a special syntax for tables it does have hash tables this library supports destructuring bind on hash tables also via the following syntax defn f a z z or tbl z  list a z f  tbl z    f  tbl   note that tbl z  is short hand which creates a hash table it can take multiple arguments tbl x  y  z  quick access to the values in the table is accomplished via tbl tbl a table x gives the value stored by x these functions are included in the library destructuring bind is fully recursive so you can nest desctructuring syntax deeply and the macros will do the right thing the macro dlet works as you expect dlet x  y  and x y  all of them create lexical scopes an alternative set of forms create dynamic scopes instead these are available as fn  defn and functions and the dloop and dloop forms create recursion points so that the recur form causes a non stack increasing recursion this is implemented via a codewalking macro and the new dsetq form which takes the same kind of input as a let but setqs the values instead of creating a scope with these extensions you can write dloop x  output nil if x  reverse output recur and x  cons x output which evaluates to            functions create implicit loop points so you can implement the product function like defn prod val rest as lst acc if not lst acc recur rest val acc lst prod lst  recur does not cause stack to be consumed it compiles into the loop macro anonymous functions also support recur i ve implemented primitive monad support using this library these monads are patterned after the clojure contrib monad implementation although they are substantially less complete monads use the same syntax for binding as clojure so you can do neat things with them a simple example is the identity monad require monads domonad monad id x  y  and x y  slightly more interesting is the maybe monad domonad monad maybe x just  k maybe and x  y maybe and k  y just  domonad monad maybe x just  k maybe and x  divide by zero ruins the calculation y maybe and k  y none even more interesting is the sequence monad domonad monad seq x list    y list    list x y                   note that destructuring bind works with the monads domonad monad seq a b list       and a b    this is built on top of the fn implementation so all the desctructuring supported there works here the implementation is wacky right now but will be cleaned up when i can find moments of respite from writing my dissertation update  apr  fixed a bug in the expansion of recur wherein tail calls inside let like forms let let  lexical let lexical let  labels flet would not expand improved the fn and fn macros so that they do not compile to loops if recur is not used in their bodies this is a tradeoff between compilation and execution speed update  mar  finally implemented recur keywords also implemented a destructuring set operation added a dloop macro update  aug  added state monad monad state update  aug  fixed a regression in defn code which disabled the ability to make defn s interactive added monads identity monad maybe monad sequence monad monads support clojure style destructuring bind via domonad expressions no support for with monad yet update  july  fixed bug in dlet which caused an error with using the let like semantics dlet is now a recursive macro todo re implement fn in terms of dlet still will require special handling of the top level form update  july  fixed bug wherein empty arg lists would give an error update  june  added support for or forms for sequence binding types note you can t use them at the top level binder because they would confuse the automatic dispatch of function bodies on arity sorry update  june  added support for keys in table binder corrected several small bugs introduced by new parsing code update  june  rewrote binder parsing code so that it is easier to extend and support error checking added support for or forms in table binders the form after or is evaluated at call time rather than compile time and must result in a hash table with the appropriate keys to provide defaults defn f a z z or tbl z  list a z f  tbl z    f  tbl   update  june  added extensive checking of binder forms at compile time and what are hopefully informative error messages add support for or form to the table destructuring update  june  defn now expands in terms of the fn macro lots more error checking some simple checks for misformed binders also checks for arity when the function is called update  may  added support for multiple arity defn and fn definitions defn f x x x y x y f   f    some emacs utilities with clojure style destructuring bind defn demo a b c d list a b c d demo   list       the binding also works with hashtables defn demo a b c x d y list a b c d let a table tbl x  y  demo   a table     most useful in the utils package may be a pair of functions for creating and manipulating hash tables tbl x  y  creates a hash table with keys x y and associated values tbl a table x returns the value at key x update  june  corrected a bug in defn expansion with recur update  oct  added lots of bug fixes codewalking macros and functions to help write them capturing defun and capturing lambda which attempt to meaningfully capture their apparent lexical scope don t really work added lex lambda and lex defun which automatically create lexical scopes around their bodies containing their args implemented monadic parser combinators using the monads in monads el added lots more stack language functions added a units library for dealing with si units sort of smartly integrates with with stack because unit calculations look nice there

965148, thanks to boxerab who contributed a lot and to adamgit for forking svgquartzrenderer  about svgquartzrenderer  svgquartzrenderer is a basic svg renderer written in obj c that uses coregraphics to render svg files the goal of svgquartzrenderer is to be a simple drop in svg renderer that is compatible with the iphone platform and conforms to a subset of svg   tiny everything except animation current state of svgquartzrenderer  svgquartzrenderer is currently quite far from conforming to any svg profile at all it can however render some of the more common elements found in an svg file here is a list of its current capabilities cubic curves embedded images text note limited support only postscript core fonts fill and stroke gradient fills pattern fills note transformation of pattern fills is not yet implemented notable features that are not yet supported quadratic curves shapes other than rect embedded glyphs filters flowregions for text this means that any text that has a wrapping boundary so to speak won t render known issues  other than the above listed missing features there are some issues with how svgquartzrenderer handles transformation stacks in some cases elements in the svg will be located in strange places where they are not supposed to be the easiest solution for the moment is to try and modify the file in inkscape and get it to change the transformation values until svgquartzrenderer can handle it text with nested tspan elements won t work that will happen if the style of one word is changed the workaround is to use separate text nodes for each style change if you run in to any other bugs please create an issue here on github

named after the env you want to target migrations are simple activerecord migrations and a seed rb file is available to pre seed the db files in the lib folder aren t automatically required the dsl for writing an api is straight forward describeservice helloworld do and service and service formats json service httpverb get service disableauth on by default input service param string name default world output service response do and response and response object do and obj and obj string message doc the greeting message sent back defaults to world obj datetime at doc the timestamp of when the

you can defined them direcly on the service object ensuring that the method will only be available within this service def service baz baz end the app test suite uses a series of helpers wrapping rack and test to test a request going through the stack but without the overhead of actually doing a real http request to validate that a service responds as defined in the dsl you can use the provided helpers here is an example class helloworldtest minitest unit testcase def testresponse testapi get and helloworld  name matt assertapiresponse end the testapi module dispatches a request to the app and the assertapiresponse helper will validate that the response matches the service description look at the test and testhelpers rb file to see the many other helpers such as testapi lastresponse  testapi jsonresponse  testapi mobileget etc to automatically re run tests whilst you are editing your api or your tests bundle exec guard reasons for a dsl vs the standard rails approach  api design becomes the number  focus by focusing on designing the api and documenting it in one unique place there is no more digging through  layers of code using the provided tools meant to generate html documentation you can focus on what matters the most design and communication  save development time an api can be designed and even tested mocked right away even before the implementation is done this is a huge gain of time when dealing with multiple third parties consuming an api one can spend more time designing and testing against mock data and then finally implement  isolation and standalone each api lives in its own file it s easily copied over easy to grasp and easy to see the involved dependencies  backend agnostic potentially language agnostic because the dsl is precompiled and creates simple objects the dsl can be plugged on almost any backend as long as the backend is flexible enough to let you create a route and a function to execute when the route is matched the implementation doesn t even actually have to be in ruby this is far to be done but i d love to see the dsls to be compiled in a language agnostic format to then be loaded by a different backend offering a processing engine for it i e implementation  simpler and easier this goes back to my  point but think about new developers and people wanting to build apis do they really need to know and understand how the router works enter a route pointing to a controller and a specific action which has a view attached by simplifying the path you get better performance less objects allocated less gc time smaller stack  better understanding for all the entire stack in probably k loc max and people getting up and running right away  documentation documenting apis is a pain and it s hard to keep track of changes generated documentation usually isn t really good and you want some humans to explain what the service does and how by offering a compromise of required documentation incoming param rules  strongly encouraged documentation response definition used for testing and suggested documentation english text for each parts of the request and response  the developer can think of how people will consume the data and can keep the documentation up to date at a pretty low cost the documentation is then extracted from the dsl and provided in a html format  security the dsl implementation enforces param verification name type options length etc which provides an extra layer of security for your endpoints remember the github security accident  conventions because the work surface is smaller one can more easily encourage conventions and provide dsl add ons for shared features also because the implementation call is a simple ruby block with helpers and request context available it encourages developers to better organize their code  stability because the code base is simple it doesn t need to be updated often a new orm can be added or a new library but doing that doesn t have to affect the provided micro framework  portability porting a rails app to the dsl is actually almost trivial i even have a a module to point dsls to controller with actions so the only thing that needs to be changed is the view rendering see the wsdsl for the module in question  testability tests can run fast while still going through the stack because each test can have access to the entire service description including the expected response  the amount of automatic tests can be increased reducing the amount of dev work and assuring that the rd party users who built on their code on top of the documentation don t see regressions due to poorly written tests  performance this mini framework is designed to run at optimal speed a thread pool is set by default and can be tweaked the amount of objects allocated is reduced to a minimum and because of the small code base optimizations can be done for a given runtime environment  freedom because the implementation of each service is left up to the developer various orms data stores or libraries can be used without making a radical change to the project apis still look the same and all follow the dsl but the implementation is a different concern which can evolve at a different path  modularity if an api app grows too much it is very easy to extract some apis and move them to a new app especially if models are organized in packages and can be shared between applications that s a longer discussion ask me if you want to hear more about that  customization adding new features or standard code paths for all apps is trivial and easy to maintain there are very little cons but let me try to list them nonetheless  it s not rails rails has decent documentation people are used to it and it s a well maintained project the problem though is that most of the documentation isn t to develop apis people are used to write web  websites with rails and well most of the new features are html related streaming asset pipeline coffeescript and scss the good news is that we can probably run the same dsl on top of rails   you can t google it true but it should be so easy that you don t need to google it you can also not google most of what s going in out apps nowadays because the code is simple and it is based on well known elements that shouldn t be a problem  deployment it s ruby based it s rack based and it s even sinatra based if you can deploy a ruby web app you can deploy an app like that and yes it even works on heroku  maintenance and support the code shouldn t need maintenance except for bugs being found or new requested features because it s just a bootloader  loc w and empty lines  a layer to implement the dsl on top of sinatra  loc w and spaces  some test helpers  loc w and spaces and some rake tasks most of the maintenance and support is actually required on the libraries used such as the web engine sinatra  the orm or the other rd party libraries used at the end of the day this is just a simple dsl on top of well known well maintained libraries and there are no monkey patching going on rspec helpers and more service examples improve documentation templates make the orm configurable generators for blank apis and migrations generator to create new apps based on this template provide rack client as a test alternative to make real http calls and test against a staging environment for instance create a test suite that can be run against production to validate a deployment

796679, a fork of autosuggest jquery plugin writtern by drew wilson autosuggest will turn any regular text input box into a rad auto complete box it will dynamically create all the html elements that it needs to function you don t need to add any extra html to work with autosuggest also autosuggest uses zero images all styling is done  in the included css file this means it is super easy to customize the look of everything you only need to edit the included css file you can even use images if you want just add the appropriate lines of code into the css file as you type into the autosuggest input box it will filter through it s data and suggest matched data items to you you can pass in an object of data to autosuggest or you can have it call a url as you type to get it s data from autosuggest will display the matched data items in a selectable list which is  customizable you have the option of structuring the html elements of that list however you want via the formatlist callback function you case an example of this in the second example above when you type into the input box and the suggestion dropdown list appears a few things happen a class of loading is applied to the main autosuggest ul while the data is loaded that class is then removed when all processing has finished and before the suggestion results list is made visible as you hover over each suggested option in the list a class of selected is added to that item and then removed when you mouseout when you make a selection the item is added to the input box also there is a hidden input field generated for each autosuggest box that stores the values comma separated of each item you have selected this input box will have a unique id as well as a class name of as values mick would be the search query that was typed into the input box be sure to setup your server side code to grab that param and send back some results as of autosuggest version   you can now create selections by using the tab or comma keys to do this simply type something into the box and hit the tab or comma keys the selection is added to autosuggest in the exact same manner as if it were chosen from the results dropdown autosuggest has been tested and works in ie ie firefox safari opera and chrome obviously you need to make sure you have the latest jquery library at least   already loaded in your page after that it s really simple just add the following code to your page make sure to wrap your code in jquery s ready function function input type text autosuggest data the above line of code will apply autosuggest to all text type input elements on the page each one will be using the same set of data if you want to have multiple autosuggest fields on your page that use different sets of data make sure you select them separately like this function div someclass input autosuggest data someid input autosuggest otherdata doing the above will allow you to pass in different options and different data sets below is an example of using autosuggest with a data object and other various options var data items value   name mick jagger  value   name johnny storm  value   name richard hatch  value   name kelly slater  value   name rudy hamilton  value   name michael jordan input type text autosuggest data items selecteditemprop name  searchobjprops name below is an example using a url to gather the data object and other various options the value property will be stored comma separated in the hidden input field when chosen from the suggestion dropdown list you can see an example of the value property being set for each data item in the example above typically the value property would contain the id of the item so you can send a list of chosen ids to your server below is an example of how to process the data sent via ajax to your server in php php input get q data array and and query your database here looking for a match to input query mysqlquery select from mytable where myfield like input while row mysqlfetchassoc query json array json value row id json name row username json image row userphoto data json  header content type application and json echo jsonencode data if the available data will change e g if you progressively or asynchronously load more data for autosuggesting  you can pass a function to autosuggest as the data source function var slowlyloadeddata items and and obviously you d do something more interesting here settimeout function slowlyloadeddata items value   name a name   function getdata query next next slowlyloadeddata query  input type text autosuggest getdata the function will be passed two arguments query the string typed in the autosuggest box next the function dataquery you should call when you have the data available ashtmlid string false by default enables you to specify your own custom id that will be appended to the top level autosuggest ul element s id name otherwise it will default to using a random id example id customid this is also applies to the hidden input filed that holds all of the selected values example id as values customid starttext string enter name here by default text to display when the autosuggest input field is empty useplaceholder true or false false by default set html placeholder attribute to display starttext when the input field is empty emptytext string no results by default text to display when their are no search results prefill object or string empty object by default enables you to pre fill the autosuggest box with selections when the page is first loaded you can pass in a comma separated list of values a string  or an object when using a string each value is used as both the display text on the selected item and for it s value when using an object the options selecteditemprop will define the object property to use for the display text and selectedvaluesprop will define the object property to use for the value for the selected item note you must setup your prefill object in that format a prefill object can look just like the example objects laid out above limittext string no more selections are allowed by default text to display when the number of selections has reached it s limit selecteditemprop string value by default name of object property to use as the display text for each chosen item selectedvaluesprop string value by default name of object property to use as the value for each chosen item this value will be stored into the hidden input field searchobjprops string value by default comma separated list of object property names the values in these objects properties will be used as the text to perform the search on queryparam string q by default the name of the param that will hold the search string value in the ajax request retrievelimit number false by default if set to a number it will add a limit param to the ajax request it also limits the number of search results allowed to be displayed in the results dropdown box extraparams callback function or string by default this will be added onto the end of the ajax request url make sure you add an before each param if used as a callback function it must return a string of query params starting with the callback function is fired before each search is performed matchcase true or false false by default make the search case sensitive when set to true minchars number  by default minimum number of characters that must be entered into the autosuggest input field before the search begins keydelay number  by default number of milliseconds to delay after a keydown on the autosuggest input field and before search is started resultshighlight true or false true by default option to choose whether or not to highlight the matched text in each result item neversubmit true or false false by default if set to true this option will never allow the return key to submit the form that autosuggest is a part of selectionlimit number false by default limits the number of selections that are allowed to be made to the number specified showresultlist true or false true by default if set to false  the results dropdown list will never be shown at any time start callback function custom function that is run only once on each autosuggest field when the code is first applied a set of callbacks are passed the callbacks are add for selecting a data item from code pass the whole item to select and remove for removing a selected item from code pass the value selectionclick callback function custom function that is run when a previously chosen item is clicked the item that is clicked is passed into this callback function as elem example selectionclick function elem elem fadeto slow    selectionadded callback function custom function that is run when a selection is made by choosing one from the results dropdown or by using the tab and comma keys to add one the selection item is passed into this callback function as elem example selectionadded function elem elem fadeto slow    selectionremoved callback function custom function that is run when a selection removed from the autosuggest by using the delete key or by clicking the x inside the selection the selection item is passed into this callback function as elem example selectionremoved function elem elem fadeto fast   function elem remove formatlist callback function custom function that is run after all the data has been retrieved and before the results are put into the suggestion results list this is here so you can modify what how things show up in the suggestion results list beforeretrieve callback function custom function that is run right before the ajax request is made or before the local objected is searched this is used to modify the search string before it is processed so if a user entered jim into the autosuggest box you can call this function to prepend their query with guy making the final query guyjim the search query is passed into this function example beforeretrieve function string return string retrievecomplete callback function custom function that is run after the ajax request has completed the data object must be returned if this is used example retrievecomplete function data return data resultclick callback function custom function that is run when a search result item is clicked the data from the item that is clicked is passed into this callback function as data example resultclick function data console log data resultscomplete callback function custom function that is run when the suggestion results dropdown list is made visible will run after every search query the formatlist option will hand you  objects data this is the data you originally passed into autosuggest or retrieved via an ajax request elem this is the html element you will be formatting the result li item in order to add extra things to the result item like an image you will need to make sure you pass that data into autosuggest below is an example of formatlist in action formatlist function data elem var myimage data image var newelem elem html add and change stuff here put image here etc return newelem you must return the html object formatlist will run on each result item

3262889, newman is a microframework which aims to do for email based applications what rack and sinatra have done for web programming while our goals may be ambitious this project is currently in a very early experimental stage and is in no way safe for use in production that said newman is already capable of doing a number of interesting things in particular a simple polling server provides a basic interface for reading email from a single inbox and then building up a response email filters are provided for handling emails based on their to and subject fields filters can also be defined for handling messages based on arbitrary conditions evaluated against a mail messsage object a rudimentary pstore backed storage mechanism is provided for persistence basic support for maintaining persistent lists of email addresses is provided basic support for email templates are provided via tilt a barebones configuration system allows configuring email settings service settings and application specific settings we are still working on figuring out what belongs in newman and what doesn t and so all of these features are subject to change or disappear entirely but if you have a need for this sort of tool it s worth noting that this software isn t entirely vaporware and that we could use your help don t hook up newman to any email inbox that you can t completely wipe out every time it runs newman will delete your emails simple examples in this repository we update this documentation on each gem release of newman but to generate this documentation yourself you ll need to install the rocco gem find seacreature or ericgj in the newman channel on freenode or send an email to newman librelist org we do not yet have a clear roadmap or contributor guidelines so be sure to talk to us before working on bug fixes or patches but assuming you do want to send us some code here is what you need to know you get to keep the copyright to your code but you must agree to license it under the mit license your code should come with tests integration tests are fine but unit tests would be nice where appropriate right now newman is under tested and we don t want to make that problem worse you can of course submit a pull request for feedback before writing tests your code should be fully documented and properly formatted for use with rocco please try to emulate the style and conventions we ve been using where possible do the best you can with this and we ll help tighten up wording and clean up formatting as needed you can of course submit a pull request for feedback before writing documentation newman is taking a use case oriented approach to design be prepared to justify any proposed change with real or realistic scenarios rather than simply addressing theoretical concerns we will try to follow the guidelines below when cutting new releases to the extent that it makes sense to do so  clearly mark each object that newman provides as being part of either the external api or the internal api the external api is for application developers the internal api is for newman itself as well as extension developers  before   allow backwards incompatible internal api changes during every release and allow backwards incompatible external api changes during minor version bumps but do not add or change external behavior in tiny version bumps  after   do not allow external or internal api changes during tiny version bumps these will be bug fixes only allow changes to the internal api during minor version bumps but maintain backwards compatibility with the   release i e things introduced after   can be changed and removed but things which shipped with   should stay supported even internally allow external api changes or backwards incompatible changes to the internals only on major version bumps i e     etc use semantic versioning and declare the external api to be the public api we plan to get to   quickly to reach a stabilizing point for application developers and a slower moving target for extension developers this means that our   release will be more of a minimum viable product and not necessarily a full stack framework help from several other folks it is based on an assignment from mendicant journal the original inspiration for this project came from some code as well as from the general ideas behind rack and sinatra

5340791, hyperspider  hyperspider is great for folks that want to create clean granular and self documenting hypertext apis but avoid the latency of remotely fetching hundreds of tiny http resources let s say you had a twitter clone with a hypertext json api including the following two sample endpoints href and users and jedschmidt  name jed schmidt  location href and japan and tokyo  updates href and users and jedschmidt and updates  following href and users and jedschmidt and following  followers href and users and jedschmidt and followers href and users and jedschmidt and following  items href and users and janl  href and users and cramforce  href and users and hblank  href and users and theophani to create a single following detailed resource so that api consumers don t have to make a separate http call for each resource use hyperspider like this javascript var hyperspider require hyperspider var options host mytwitterclone biz  path and users and jedschmidt  and users and jedschmidt and following  and users and hyperspider options function err data and and data is an array with the result entities of  endpoints and and  and users and jedschmidt and and  and users and jedschmidt and following and and  and users and janl and and  and users and cramforce and and  and users and hblank and and  and users and theophani installation  npm i hyperspider a normal url path such as and users a function that takes a path and returns a boolean a regexp that matches a path a wildcard url path to turn into a regexp with replaced by and and and replaced by an array containing any of the above note that path must contain at least one normal url path to serve as the starting point for the crawl callback err data buffers the event stream into a single callback err is null if no errors occurred and otherwise the first error emitted with subsequent errors available from the next property of the error data is an array of responses one for each successful http call omit this to listen for a stream of events this method takes a single argument an http response override this before adding listeners to customize how hyperspider should extract urls from each resource by default the response body is parsed into json extracting the value of every nested href property but you could roll your own such as parsing link headers etc
3278736, version    a requirejs plugin for wrapping regular scripts as amd modules this is useful for cases where regular scripts have dependencies like jquery plugins and backbone in your require config use the wrapjs object to specify which scripts you want to wrap use the deps attribute to specify all the script s dependencies use the attach attribute to specify the global name of the library think   backbone etc use the path attribute to specify the location of the script to wrap alternatively use require s regular path config the following example wraps backbone declaring underscore and jquery as dependencies require config wrapjs backbone deps underscore  jquery  and and an array of the script s dependencies attach backbone now use the wrap plugin to load the backbone and its dependencies like so require wrap backbone  function backbone console log backbone and and now returns backbone just as if backbone were an amd module during development wrap js basically does a nested require for you so that the script s dependencies are sure to load first then when you run the r js build an actual amd module is generated based on your config so say you were trying to wrap backbone js and the backbone js script looks like this function and and stuff call this now after the r js build backbone looks like this define wrap backbone  jquery  underscore  function function and and backbone stuff call this return function var attach backbone return typeof attach function attach apply this attach note the generated amd module contains an immediate function that resolves to and returns backbone in the example above pure js magic so there you have it the wrap js plugin turns any old script into an amd module with just a little config i ve included several examples in the examples directory
3324813, it s currently not possible to use cocoa s drag and drop classes and protocols in iphone and ipad apps this really sucks implementing a uipangesturerecognizer is really fucking boring sedraggable is a subclass of uiview that fills this void making it easy to add drag and drop functionality to any uiview in your application note check out the example project it s a pain to explain code in english and i didn t try very hard add the source files to your xcode project import the sedraggable h and sedraggablelocation h headers objective c to initialize an instance of sedraggable you ll probably want to use one of these objective c id initwithframe cgrect frame id initwithimage uiimage image andsize cgsize size id initwithimageview uiimageview imageview objective c and and set up the uiimageview that will be used as the visible component of our draggable element uiimage image uiimage alloc initwithcontentsoffile somefile png uiimageview imageview uiimageview alloc initwithimage image and and initialize the draggable element itself sedraggable draggableview sedraggable initwithimageview imageview of course as mentioned there are simpler init methods to suit different objective c cgrect frame cgrectmake     sedraggable draggableview sedraggable initwithframe frame and and or sedraggable draggableview sedraggable init sedraggablelocation allows you to easily switch between certain automatic behaviors for example visually arranging a set of sedraggable objects so that they don t appear to be haphazardly strewn about or yanking an sedraggable back to its original location when a drag and drop operation is unsuccessful for some reason try something like the following run the code and then play around with the draggable objects to see how they behave objective c sedraggable draggableview and and create the sedraggablelocation to represent the draggable element s starting point cgrect homelocationbounds cgrectmake     cgrect otherlocationbounds cgrectmake     sedraggablelocation homelocation sedraggablelocation initwithbounds homelocationbounds sedraggablelocation otherlocation sedraggablelocation initwithbounds

homelocation adddraggableobject draggableview you can even specify different boundaries for where an sedraggablelocation will accept dropped objects and where it will place them and these two regions don t even have to be contiguous in any way it s kind of cool to watch what happens if they re not when you drop your draggable objects they fly from one area of the screen to another automatically these are the two properties you ll want to look at if you want to configure this kind of behavior objective c property nonatomic readwrite cgrect responsivebounds property nonatomic readwrite cgrect objectgutterbounds you can specify a delegate that will be notified of pertinent drag and drop events delegates of sedraggable and sedraggablelocation objects must conform either to the

7105990, multicursor  multicursor user manual by daniel thau if you d like to skip the whole reading nonsense and watch a nice wholesome video which explains multicursor instead see description  this plugin will allow vim to utilize multiple cursors simultaneously this can be used to do things such as refactor many lines at the same time multicursor currently requires vim   for undotree multicursor can be installed like most other vim plugins on a unixy system without a plugin manager the multicursor vim file should be located at and vim and plugin and multicursor vim on a unixy system with pathogen the multicursor vim file should be located at and vim and bundle and multicursor and plugin and multicursor vim on a windows system without a plugin manager the multicursor vim file should be located at userprofile vimfiles plugin multicursor vim on a windows system with pathogen the multicursor vim file should be located at userprofile vimfiles bundle multicursor plugin multicursor vim if you are using a plugin manager other than pathogen see its documentation for how to install multicursor it should be comparable to other plugins if you would like the documentation to also be installed include multicursor txt into the relevant directory described above replacing plugin with doc there are a few ways to access multicursor s functionality none of which have mappings out of the box you will have to create your own mappings if you would like to manually place cursors by moving your cursor above each location and pressing a keybinding set the keybinding like so setting keys as desired nnoremap keys c u call multicursorplacecursor cr to actually utilize these manually placed cursors you will need to call another nnoremap keys c u call multicursormanual cr if you would like to cancel manually placed cursors without utilizing them nnoremap keys c u call multicursorremovecursors cr you can also create cursors from visual mode xnoremap keys c u call multicursorvisual cr this will create one cursor per visually selected line moreover with this mapping you can prepend keys with a number this number will tell multicursor to only create one cursor per that many lines for example running  keys will create a cursor on every other line of the visually selected area finally you can create cursors by searching the buffer via regular expressions to have multicursor prompt you for the search pattern nnoremap keys c u call multicursorsearch cr if the argument to the function in the above mapping is a non empty string that will be the pattern which will be searched for this can be utilized to do things such as create a cursor at every word like the word under the cursor nnoremap keys c u call multicursorsearch c r c w cr or every group of characters like those visually selected xnoremap keys y esc call multicursorsearch c r substitute escape  and  n  n  g cr cr some of the above magic was borrowed from the searchparty finally you should set a keybinding to stop using multiple cursors and fall back to the normal single cursor like so let g multicursorquit keys this will quit multicursor from normal mode ie if pressed in another mode such as insert or visual it will act as though there is no special mapping this functions somewhat like mapleader  except that it is limited to what can be provided by a single getchar after it has been run through nrchar if g multicursorquit does not seem to work you can fall back to ctrl c in addition to creating mappings you can override the color scheme used by multicursor for the cursors by setting the multicursor highlight group see highlight to utilize multiple cursors you must first create the extra cursors there are several methods to do so the setup method for each is described above in multicursor setup they are summarized here as well you can move the normal singular cursor over each location at which you would like to create a cursor then press a mapping to create a cursor at that location you can then either cancel about to be created cursors with another mapping or begin utilizing all of the cursors you ve created with yet another mapping you can visually select an area and run a mapping to create a cursor on every line of the visually selected area in the left most column moreover you can prefix the mapping with a count to tell multicursor to only create one cursor for however many lines you can create a cursor at every position which matches a regular expression search mappings can be made to expand on this for example mappings can be made to search for the word under the cursor or the characters in the visually selected area once the cursors are created and being used most commands entered into vim will be applied at each of the cursor positions for example diw will delete the word under each of the cursors you can stop using multiple cursors by typing g multicursorquit or if that is not working fall back to ctrl c known issues  insert mode works however the output is not updated in the buffer until it has been completed ie the mode as returned to normal mode do note that the pending command is shown at the bottom to allow you to see what you are typing interactive ui such as popup menus for ins completion will not visual mode mostly works however like insert mode the result is not updated in the buffer until it has been completed again like insert mode you can see the pending command at the bottom to help create the in progress command the cmdline works but like insert and visual mode it has limitations you won t get to see things like the wildmenu additionally output from commands such as ls don t work note that cmdline commands are run for every cursor this is not necessarily an issue  as it is useful if one wants to run a substitute at every cursor but it is potentially confusing at first multi key normal mode maps do not work insert mode and visual mode maps do work although their end may not be recognized and they may not trigger instantly see item below in some situations particularly with either visual mode and mappings and plugins multicursor does not detect that a command has finished to resolve this simply continue entering other commands either useful commands or just empty escapes until multicursor figures it out most things which should be stored per cursor such as the jump list are not the exception is registers each cursor gets its own set of all of the registers undo should work as expected the changes by all of the cursors are grouped into one undo block cursors can be be moved on top of each other it could be nice if multicursor detected this situation and rejected the command to avoid such situations as having stacked cursors is almost never useful but often troublesome multicursor will move around cursors to reflect the change in the buffer due to other cursors for example if the top most cursor deletes the first line all cursors below that line should be moved up by one line this works however it assumes that all cursors will change the same number of lines which is not also true also it only works on lines if there are multiple cursors in the same line which change characters within that line the other cursors on the same line will not move horizontally as expected the vim window does not redraw on events such as resizing until a key is entered cursors on areas without characters such as blank lines aren t visible if you would like to hack at multicursor the debug mode can be turned on by placing the following in your vimrc or running it in the cmdline in a running vim before calling multicursor mappings let g multicursordebug  enabling debug results in two things first in the bottom line you will see something along the lines of the following i m n u v the quoted area after i indicates the in progress command this is what multicursor normally outputs at the bottom without debug this will be blank if the last key you ve entered into vim was acted upon the quoted area after m indicates the current mode you are in if it is empty this means your current in progress command cannot be executed as it is for some reason this could indicate operator pending mode but not always it also comes up for custom mappings and plugins that aren t technically operator pending mode the quoted section after u is used for debugging undo history and contains three fields the first indicates the undo level just prior to running the previous command the second indicates the current undo level if you have just run a command which should not create an undo point these should should be identical the third field indicates whether multicursor forced an undo for the last keystroke this should occur when both conditions are true an uncompleted command such as a command that left vim in operator pending mode is the current in progress command the uncompleted command changed the buffer ie created an undo point the second result of enabling debug is that the try and catch block is disabled the try and catch block is typically used to ensure that if the user attempts to stop multicursor with ctrl c  multicursor will also clean up however the try and catch block will also hide errors if an error occurs without debug  multicursor will still remove the cursors and exit cleanly the down side to this is that it makes debugging difficult as errors are hidden hence with debugging on the try and catch block is disabled changelog       various bugfixes      initial release

957799, ni a minimalistic node framework that makes setting up an mvc project a breeze  ni helps you set up a well organized project with a file structure separated into models views controllers libraries and helpers it s intuitive and simple to use and doesn t get in the way of using other modules and node plugins in your project what s awesome about ni  it s packaged as a regular node module so you just require it and you re ready to go you can use other node modules and connect middle ware as you usually would ni doesn t get in the way it s easy to use and loads your models views controllers libraries and helpers automatically so you can just start using them everywhere how do i use ni  it s as simple as telling ni where to look for your files and then asking it to boot var ni require and lib and ni ni config root  myapp and src ni boot function and and ready to start the server the rest of your code now has access to all your models views and controllers with ni model modelname  ni view viewname and ni controller controllername note that your controllers models libraries and helpers should be packaged as node modules and your views can be plain text template markdown mustache etc  or html files you even get a router for free  ni provides a router you can use with connect to have requests sent to the appropriate controller functions according to url segments use it with connect var app connect createserver ni router and and you can add other connect middle ware here it parses the url and sends the request to the correct controller function as follows you can define custom routes using ni addroute source destination method some examples with this custom route calling myapp com will internally redirect to use your news controller and call the index function on it ni addroute and  and news and index you can use regular expressions as well this leads myapp com and register to your user controller and its register function ni addroute and and register and i and user and register if you want to use arguments with custom routes you can do that as well ni addroute and and details and and i and user and details and  you can also define functions to test the path for example calling myapp com and add and  and  will internally redirect to use the number controller and call the positive function while calling myapp com and add and  and  will call the negative function ni addroute function path var args path split and  firstnum parseint args   secondnum parseint args   result firstnum and secondnum if args  add return false and and this leaves the path untouched and prevents this function from sucking in all other requests as well return result  and number and positive and number and negative you can limit the allowed http methods by using custom routes this will internally redirect myapp com and comment to use your comments controler and its new function but only if the used http method is post or put ni addroute and comment  and comments and new  post  put and this will redirect all get requests to myapp com and comment to use your comments controller s index function ni addroute and comment  and comments and  get this way you can disallow methods for some routes as well ni addroute and comments and update  and home and methodnotallowed  get can i see an example  if you have your project organized like this and app js and controllers and calculator js and home js and views and calculator html and home html and models and calculator js you can access your stuff with ni controller calculator ni view calculator ni model calculator a really well commented example is in the source code in the and example folder check it out how would my controllers models libraries helpers look  each of those is just a node module for example the calculator controller mentioned above in the and example folder looks like this var ni require and and lib and ni  mu require mu  quip require quip var calculatorcontroller function and this function is called when the url does not indicate a function to be called so it would look like and calculator and this index function req res next res ok welcome to the calculator  and this function is called when the url indicates add as the function to be called so it would look like and calculator and add  for example loading the url and calculator and add and  and  would call the below function with a  and b  and this add function req res next a b if a b a parseint a b parseint b var template ni view calculator template var data result a and b var compiled mu compiletext template null compiled data addlistener data  function c res ok c   else res error a and b must both be provided   module exports new calculatorcontroller let s get crackin   get ni by downloading the source code or git clone ing the repo  install ni as your would any other node module by copying lib and ni js to your and nodelibraries folder  copy the and example directory and modify it to set up your project  run node app js in the copied directory to start the server we ll add ni to npm soon don t trip contributors  a big thank you to you guys who helped and are helping make ni awesome

2820445,    please note mark multiple has been superseded by multiple cursors it has all the functionality of mark multiple but with a more robust implementation and more features to get the features from mark multiple use mc and mark more like this in place of mark more like this set rectangular region anchor as a more convenient replacement for inline string rectangle or mc and edit lines for a more familiar replacement for inline string rectangle mc and mark sgml tag pair in place of rename sgml tag mark multiple el  an emacs extension that sorta lets you mark several regions at once more precisely it allows for one master region with several mirror regions the mirrors are updated inline while you type this allows for some awesome functionality or at least some more visually pleasing insert and replace operations a general library for managing master and mirrors mark more like this which selects next and previous substring in the buffer that matches the current region inline string rectangle which works like string rectangle but lets you write inline making it less error prone rename sgml tag which updates the matching tag while typing installation  then add the modules you want to your init file require inline string rectangle global set key kbd c x r t inline string rectangle require mark more like this global set key kbd c mark previous like this global set key kbd c mark next like this global set key kbd c m m mark more like this like the other two but takes an argument negative is previous global set key kbd c mark all like this add hook sgml mode hook lambda require rename sgml tag define key sgml mode map kbd c c c r rename sgml tag feel free to come up with your own keybindings bugs and gotchas  adding a master and mirrors does not remove the active region this might feel strange but turns out to be practical the current mark multiple general library lets you do stupid shit like adding overlapping mirrors that s only a problem for people who want to write their own functions using mm and create master and mm and add mirror seems like there is some conflict with undo tree el which sometimes clobbers the undo history i might be doing something particularly stupid looking into it reverting a buffer with active marks makes them unremovable a wild idea  is this a subset of a crazy multiple point module would that even work edit yes indeed it is and yes it does this module has been pretty much goes quite a bit farther and with a saner implementation to boot contribute  if you make some nice commands with mark multiple it would be great if you opened a pull request the repo is at contributors  copyright c  magnar sveen author magnar sveen magnars gmail com keywords marking library this program is free software you can redistribute it and and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version  of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details
4868931, xcode template ane  this repository contains an xcode template that can be used to create air native extensions or anes for ios from within xcode this readme refers to some screenshots which may not appear if you are reading it on github to read this readme with the screenshots please go to using xcode templates for creating anes for ios  in air  adobe introduced native extensions which provides flash air developers the capability to extend the air runtime the native extensions mechanism allows one to write native code wrap it with an actionscript api and then use it with the rest of the actionscript code inside of an air app some background about native extensions  the following adobe devnet articles are extremely useful if you want to know more about native extensions one of the problems faced by developers working on native extensions is that creating a native extension involves too many steps and there is no seamless integration with the native ide which is xcode for ios air native extensions here i am providing an xcode project template for ios that helps flash developers in getting started with writing native extensions before i begin let me re iterate that for writing an air application that uses a native extension one needs to create the following  an actionscript library or swc which contains the actionscript code which calls into the native code  the native code on ios one needs to create a cocoatouch static library containing the native code which is then combined with the swc in step  and packaged into an ane air native extension using the adt tool  the air app which uses the ane generated in step  this xcode project template for creating anes for ios will ease step  installing and using the ane xcode project template  please ensure that you have xcode with ios installed also its preferable to close xcode now  in the attached zip air native extension zip there is a bash script installtemplates sh from the command line and installtemplates sh this will copy the xcode project templates for creating air native extensions for ios to the relevant folder in the user s home directory from where xcode will load them when launched  now launch xcode click file new new project command and shift and n you would see a new entry for air native extension under ios air native extension and screenshots and newproject png  click next and you would see the following options for configuring the xcode project air native extension and screenshots and options png the first field is the name of the extension please be careful not to use any special characters like and     and             etc the second field is a company prefix please be careful not to use any special characters like and     and             etc the third field is a static field containing the extension identifier which is formed by combining the first and second fields please note that the extension identifier mentioned here should be the same as the one specified in the application descriptor of the air app that will use this ane if a special charater is used in the first or the second fields then it will be converted to a the fifth field is the complete path to the swc or the actionscript library file this is essentially the actionscript part of your native extension here again as soon as you tab out of this field the initial and will vanish you may ignore this safely  click next and you would be asked to select a folder where you want to create your xcode project and keep your native code  click next and xcode would create a project for you air native extension and screenshots and createdproject png understanding the generated project  the project file that is generated contains a source file a header file and a few supporting files lets go over the project files one by one source and header file these contain four basic functions namely extinitializer extfinalizer contextinitializer and contextfinalizer these functions are needed for any ane which the template has already done for you there is also a fifth function issupported this is being provided purely to help you get started with writing and exposing native functions that can be called from actionscript extension xml this file contains the extension identifier and the extension s initialize extinitializer and finalize extfinalizer functions please note if you changed the names of the extension s initializer and finalizer functions in your implementation then they need to be changed here as well generateane sh as the name suggests this script is used to generate the ane file platformoptions xml more about this later targets the project contains two targets namely packagename and packagename ane the first target creates a static library the second one generates an ane by internally invoking the adt command and uses the static library extension xml and the native extension swc for the debug configuration the ane file will be generated in home and library and developer and xcode and deriveddata and projectname xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and build and products and debug iphoneos and this ane may now be used in your air app you may read more on how to do this at specifying additional linker options  when you write your ane and link it in your air app the toolchain provided as part of the air sdk by default links the ane against some of the ios frameworks however if your native code needs to link against a framework that is not included in the default list then you would see a linker error when you try to create your air app you can specify additional linker options via the platformoptions xml file while creating you ane please refer to for more details packaging resources with the ane  if there are certain resource files that you want to package in your ane apart from the native code this can be done my modifying the generateane sh script you would need to modify the adt command that is towards the end in the generateane sh script please refer to for more details feedback  i hope you find the xcode project template for anes on ios useful and it helps in making the process of writing anes simpler for you do let me know if you find any bugs

3735467, webglbrowser an ios browser shim with webgl this is a simple wrapper around uiwebview the built in webkit based browser that ships as part of ios it adds some bookmarking and other features handy for testing and enables the webgl functionality that s in the ios webkit available to iads you can t ship anything with this but you can test your code and it runs well enough to start developing touch enabled d web apps enjoy  toggled on in uiwebview on ios we hacked together some shims that made it possible to run webgl pages and although the underlying webkit implementation of webgl had some issues it was good enough for testing flash forward to today i lost the shim i had written and wanted to test some webgl content on a touch device i goes in depth through the process james did so long ago and it inspired me to whip up something a bit more useful than what i had before so here it is it s super hacky unreleasable on the app store due to the use of private apis  and since webgl is not officially supported on ios often fails in interesting ways unfortunately the performance characteristics of this shim are not indicative of what mobile safari would behave as with webgl content when and if it s enabled  as apple has disabled their jit for apps using uiwebview gpu heavy apps should be fairly close to real perf though despite some likely inefficient compositing capping the framerate at just under ass fps in theory one can grab the latest xcode with ios sdk build and run on their device with no changes should work on both iphone and ipad with ios and  add bookmarks for quickly returning to a url fullscreen mode hit the home button and reopen to return to normal mode airplay mirroring works there s a bit of a lag but the framerate is good remote inspecting when running in the ios simulator inspecting pages  awesome find you can now run the webkit inspector against pages loaded in the app unfortunately you can t inspect pages running on device yet but it s a full featured inspector debugging and networking and sampling and etc and it should match device features in safari no other browser works  qbsp runs at fps on my iphone s and ipad  nice webgl aquarium is slow  fps likely due to some scaling tricks used avoid scaling your canvas with css or doing canvas canvas draws some demos don t work because people are using platform detection use feature detection json parsing in mobile webkit is slow demos that parse large json blobs for models and etc will take awhile to load webgl conformance tests  i ran a few of the conformance test suites unfortunately the test runner hides the output at the end so i can t see all of the results some things the tests highlight that one should watch out for when testing their own code     of  passed  timed out the video test timed out drawingbufferwidth and height are undefined many programs fail to link causing many test errors looks like there are some deletion errors not properly clearing state and cleaning bindings long variable name handling in shaders ir broken gl getparameter gl compressedtextureformats null gl getprogramparameter gl linkstatus true and null not false likely the same for shaders cors handling is broken looks like it doesn t check at all pixelstorei has issues likely being ignored npot cubemaps broken uploading custom mip levels is brokenish typedarrays has a few errors with wrapping arraybuffer in arraybufferview and no floatarray conformance and typedarrays and array unit tests html copyteximaged has issues    crash

7104731, a very thin api and concepts on top of libdispatch aka grand central dispatch for cocoa objective c code i m a lazy person and so it hurts me when i have to write so much to do such common things as to schedule various blocks of code in various dispatch queues this little thing lets me write less code with the added bonus of making the result more readable first using vanilla

actual overhead is added we just rephrased things to be a little more readable wow i can haz so much fun nows there are also timers we love them timers don t we scheddelay  nslog delayed block

block in the current queue to execute after delay seconds you can call dtimerstop on the dtimer object returned from this function to cancel a timer before it has triggered and and schedule a block to be run after a delay of one second scheddelay  nslog delayed block triggered schedule a block in the current queue to be executed every interval seconds you are responsible for calling dtimerstop timer when the timer is no longer needed and and schedule a block to be run every   seconds schedinterval   nslog perpetual block triggered schedule a timer on queue which starts after delay seconds and repeats with interval if interval has a positive value the timer repeats every interval seconds in this case you are responsible for stopping the timer by calling dtimerstop timer if interval is

note that the timers returned from scheddelay  schedinterval and schedtimer are already resumed unschedule a timer that has been scheduled when pausing a timer and later resuming it the trigger time

791241, functional programming has a number of common idiomatic operations maps folds currying and so on there are a number of excellent javascript libraries which provide access to these fundamentals in a more or less functional style ojay s core extensions oliver steele s functional and jeremy ashkenas underscore are all good examples udon is cast in a similar mould to the above it aims to provide basic support for functional programming in javascript initially by porting some elements of haskell s data list library installing udon  udon is available from npm  so if you want to use udon with node you can just run the following command to globally install the library npm install g udon then it s just a matter of requiring it in your node project the module exported by the library is just the top level udon object var udon require udon udon sum     and and  otherwise you can grab pre built versions from the udon website udon or build it yourself as described below building the library  if you ve checked out the git repository and want to build a minified version of the library from source you will need ruby  rubygems and the jake gem which you can get by running with sudo if you like gem install jake from the command line then just cd into your udon directory and run which will build the library in the and pkg directory deploying with helium  udon includes a jake yml file for use with the jake build tool as explained above this also means that it is easily deployed with helium  a git backed javascript package server it should also fit into any other build or deploy system based on js packages running the test suite  the udon test suite is written with the js test testing framework the test suite runs on several javascript platforms including node and all modern web browsers to run the test suite from the command line run the following command replacing node with rhino  v etc where relevant node test and console js to run the test suite in a browser open the test and browser html file in a web building the udon website  the website is built with hakyll  a static site generator written in haskell to build it you will need ghc and cabal install the simplest way to get hold of these is to install the haskell platform you ll also need to install the hakyll package from hackage cabal install hakyll then to build the site just run this from your udon directory ghc make wall site and site

total it is up to you to manage your dwarves yes plural multitasking and create the ultimate fortress that does arithmetic and other fancy stuff hello world can be written as followed mmwmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm d d dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd w and

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm for more code examples and an explanation of what is happening here see the lower half of this readme the world armok simulates a cave with any number of dwarves in it the cave is like a tape but there are some differences it starts at position  and cannot go further left position  is magma anything going in there will never come back out all your dwarves spawn on position  positions  and  are open as well from position  onward the cave is solid you will have to mine first until you can continue your dwarves are handling rock these rocks are used for various tasks dwarves can carry any amount of rocks there are currently two ways to acquire rock mining and trading your dwarves can construct workshops which will use rocks in one way or another to do more complicated things instructions there are  instructions in armok  of them control the dwarves move right moves the dwarf  tile to the right if he hits a solid wall he dies move left moves the dwarf  tile to the left if he walks into magma he dies m mine if it s there he turns a solid wall to the right of him into a pile of  rocks he also takes a rock from the pile to his right if there are any d dump if he has a rock in his inventory he will dump it to the tile on his left w work will construct a workshop on that tile if there is none will work in a workshop if there is which workshop is constructed depends on how many rocks he s carrying the two remaining are for setting things up and creates a new dwarf every instruction coming after that which is not and or  will be his tasks creates a new subroutine every instruction coming after that which is not and or  will be the tasks each dwarf starts with an instruction set each subroutine is also an instruction set the order in your source code defines the number assigned to the instruction set starting with  this is useful for later but what that means is that if you create a dwarf it will have subroutine number  if you then create another subroutine it will have number  another dwarf number  and so on workshops currently there are three workshops implemented but this number will increase as armok is further developed workshops are built with the work command if a tile doesn t contain one workshops are then worked by using the work command while on one  trader this is your input and output if you dwarf is carrying rocks and he works at a trader he will output them as a character if your dwarf is not carrying rocks and he works then he takes the next character from the input if there is no further input the traders will murder him  manager s office this is your manager dwarves that issue a work instruction on a manager s office will start a subroutine which subroutine depends on the amount of rocks dumped on the office so if there are  rocks on it instruction set  will be assinged to the dwarf working at a manager with  rocks will destroy the office  appraiser in this office your dwarves will compare their rocks to the rocks on the ground here if they are carrying more they will dump one to the tile on the left if they are carrying the same amount or less nothing happens more is yet to come such as a way for dwarves to interact with each other for more parallel goodness speaking of which parallellism dwarves work in parallel sort of every turn the dwarves that aren t dead do one task they do this in order this means that you can create multiple dwarves and have them do specific tasks repeatedly or time their turns just right so they always help each other make your fort more efficient instead of writing the shortest hello world  it is now a challenge to write the one that takes the least amount of turns your dwarves can die currently there are  ways they can die if they run out of work they will be stricken by melancholy if they fail to construct a workshop they will go stark raving mad if they run into a wall they will die if they run into magma they will die if they want input from the traders but there isn t any they will be murdered by the filthy backstabbing elves when all your dwarves are dead the program terminates example programs when we look at the bare basics this is how you write hello world and mwmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm w mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmm w mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm w mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm w actually i m lying that s not hello world  that s hell and your dwarf will then promptly walk into magma and die truth be told i got bored after that second l because rocks are a limited resource per tile and i can t show the fancy stuff yet so what s happening here well let s look at the first few characters of the code and mw here we define a new dwarf his first tasks will be to move right twice then mine and then work when he works he notices there is no workshop yet so he creates one using the rock he just mined one rock creates a trader so after he has created the trader he starts mining like crazy occasionally moving right when he runs out of rock to mine and then he goes back to the trader to work since he has rocks he outputs those as a character he does this  times before going mad and running all the way left into the magma so let s cheat a little let s create hello world  but this time we use the trader to supply the letters and mwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww this time we create a dwarf move him to the right twice and then we mine once we then create the trading depot after that we work for another  turns so what does this do the first time we work the depot we don t have any rocks so the dwarf asks for input once he has that he will work again since he now has rocks he will output them so if we supply hello world as input he will output that as well yay however currently we are limited by length if the input is shorter it s no problem but if it s longer then he will wander off and die before he can output everything which brings me to the next point the manager let s write a program that takes input of any length and outputs that again and mwmm w mmdd w ww w it s even shorter than the one above so what s happening here the dwarf first creates a trader and then creates a manager s office to the left of that finally he dumps two rocks on the manager s office moves to it and works but you ll notice that there is a subroutine in this line of code ww w since this is the second subroutine the first being the instructions for the dwarf itself  we ve placed two rocks on the manager s office when the dwarf gets to work at the office he ll do the subroutine next so he then moves to the right works twice gets input from trader then outputs it again  moves left and works again since his final step is to work on the manager he ll be assigned routine  again this repeats until the traders kill him when there is no more input let s kill  dwarves in  different ways and and and w and and mww the first dwarf has no instructions so he turns melancholic and dies the second dwarf moves left and walks into magma the third dwarf tries to create a workshop but he has no rock so he goes stark raving mad the fourth dwarf runs head long into a wall and dies the fifth dwarf goes to the wall mines a rock builds a trader then trades but if there s no input the traders murder him infinite mining and hauling to a specific tile since each cave wall contains  rocks we need to keep mining if we want more to work with but we also want a single source tile of rock how can we achieve this with managers mmwmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm d d dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd w w and mm w mmmdddmmwmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm d w this code will create a dwarf that will mine indefinitely and dump it all on tile  so what s going on here you ll notice that the subroutines are defined before the dwarf this is to save rocks even though we re going to mine an infinite amount of them we don t want to waste any if we can help it what we need is the following a drop point a moving mining point a path between those two that s exactly what those  subroutines are the first is the mining point it will mine and create a new manager with the mining subroutine for next time it will then drop a rock on the mining manager before turning it into a path manager extending the chain the second is the path in between move right work at the next then move left chained together these will make a dwarf move on and on until he finds something else to do the third is the drop point dump all your rock then move right to either a mining point or a path towards one  work move left and work here again to keep things infinite in order to remove infinity from this simply remove the last work order from the drop subroutine and add manual work tasks to the dwarf itself the dwarf itself will set things up to drop everything at position  when he s done he ll have created two workshops one for dropping one for mining a big drawback from this is that the entire pathway will be filled with manager offices true hello world with the knowledge we have right now it s possible to create an actual hello world program for it we ll need  rocks for the output we ll need a few more for various things if we do the mining routine  times we should have enough rocks to work with mmwmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm d d dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd w and mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd mm w mmmdddmmwmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm d wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd mmm wddw mmm ddd ww mmmmmmmm w www mmmmm w

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm lots of things happening here right now first of all we re going to mine roughly  rocks because we can they will all be dumped on tile  the first half of the dwarf s code is just that once that s done we ll do the following mmm wddw mmm ddd ww mmmmmmmm w www mmmmm w www mmmmmmmmmmmm w www mmmmmmmmmmmm w www mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm w w w ww mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm w www mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm w www mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm w www mmmmmmmmmmmm w www mmmm w w m w this part will remove the manager s office and replace it with a trader then we ll add rocks to the manager next to it so it points to routine  routine  basically means pick up  rocks from the rock stockpile we have we want  because capitals start at the  range and normal letters at the  range the remainder of the dwarf s code is to gather additional rocks in order to form the letters then trade finally we end up with hello world d and it only takes  turns we can probably shave off a bunch of wasted time on movement by swapping the trader and the manager mining a few rocks less etc but i think the main turn advantage will be in parallellism but that s for later visualizer the source code now has its user interface separated from the language itself sort of it is theoretically possible to just build the language and run that from console with your code as input it will then ask you for your text input and run it with that however if you are a filthy elf like me you d prefer the use of a fancy visualizer simply start the visualizer program enter your source code then hit the debug button a fancy new window will appear in this new window you can view the state of your world in the box on the top the cave is shown the first line is the index the second is the rock count and the third line are if any dorfs or workshops are there todo give more info about the dorfs and workshops and a way to view more detailed cell information then you ll have dwarf information the box on the left shows all your dwarfs and a quick overview of their state select one to view his remaining orders after that comes the routine list select one to view the details the number is the one that managers will match their rock count to finally you can view the output of your program and some trace information below that are some fancy input buttons first the lower left label is the turn count the small textbox holds the input for traders you can change this at any time when it is not actively running the step button makes the fort step once the run button makes it run until all dorfs are dead or for   turns the run until button makes it run until a specific condition is met or until they are all dead or k turns have passed the exterminate button exterminates all the dorfs handy if you re stuck in an infinite loop the future i ve got some interesting ideas for this this is the first time i m creating my own language just for fun so i have no idea what i ll end up with however i d like to focus on making the dorfs work in parallel some ideas are jailing a dorf skipping his turns until he is freed then you can create mathematical mini routines that start whenever you want a mayor s office mandating whatever subroutine to every dwarf that walks on that tile a lever linked to magma floodgates fun for the whole fortress basically kills every dwarf and terminates the program breeding create new dwarves starting with a specific subroutine stuff like that but the main priority is to add some way of doing maths with the rocks comparisons at least

library nme is a reimplementation of the flash api for different platforms hydrax is a game engine so it higher level and specifically designed to ease the creation of games hydrax is not a direct competitor to nme rather it sits on top of it using nme to run on e g mobile devices using nme with hydrax is optional nb the html target for nme is not yet compatible with hydrax ios via nme android via nme components everything is based on components that you can easily replace with your own asset handling injection via robotlegs robothaxe platform independent d display platform independent input currently flash and canvas only handling transitioning between game screens or levels managing complicated game objects  install haxe haxe  at the terminal and dos prompt type haxelib install hydrax  download this repository  go to the repository folder demo and  bitmap rendering and in a terminal or dos prompt  create a folder there called build if one doesn t already exist  type haxe buildflash hxml  open the swf in demo and  bitmap rendering and build and demo swf  you should see an image moving around the screen border or you can type haxelib run nme test nme nmml flash haxelib run nme test nme nmml ios simulator haxe and the pbe are a natural fit pbe is an excellent engine for building games as the component plug in architecture eases building of complex game objects with a minimum of code rewriting this component architecture also makes it easier to write games for different platforms as different components can be used for different platforms in a natural way haxe provides an outright performance boost for games running in flash compared to games written in as many games require server side functionality haxe compiles to several server side languages and platforms allowing a single language for the entire game development this capability alone is awesome i ll say it again you can write game logic once that runs on the client and the server currently hydrax will mostly keep the pbe package structure of the core classes with permission from ben garney pb labs this may change if hydrax diverges sufficiently community contributions are encouraged complete or functional core engine injection rendering flash html ios android modified the original as pbe code to handle different platforms xml template system and pbe serialization resources rebuilt to handle multi platform and haxe only resources tasks and tweens profiling extra features not available in pbe multiplatform flash and html js rendering c and and for standalone ios and

haxe incomplete or not working sound cross platform sound is definitely needed pbe animations pbe sets hydrax uses a context specific setmanager optional state machine very low priority the pbe static class not needed or useful with haxe using functionality debugging due to the extra features and multi platform capability of haxe or just personal motivation  some components and features underwent more modifications than others also the package structure outside of the core engine are slightly modified almost everything outside of the core engine is grouped under com pblabs components instead of com pblabs hxhsl signals instead of as events the signalbondmanager provides listener registration on entity and component objects with automatic listener removal upon object destruction rendering has been modified to simplify cross platform d rendering the flash api has not been duplicated as in nme nme  nor do i intend to input rewritten to handle cross platform input mouse touch screens etc

4553012, mosho is another browser based presentation framework inspired by impress js but in my own flavor if you re familiar with impress the basics are the same use data x and y and z and rot x and y and z and scale attributes to move around mosho slide class elements all wrapped in a mosho class container arrows and spacebar move start transitions from slide to slide and hash links are followed appropriately the rest of these docs are mostly for reference if you d like to get a feel for what the code looks like check out everything in the demo directory slide mosho slide attributes translate the slide in d space rotate the slide in d space order is xzy make the slide bigger  or smaller  x  than it would otherwise be introduce non linear flow by changing destination slide in either direction like css transitions minus the property specifier get s applied to the container element think camera before transitioning to the element with this transition slide groups mosho group slides can be nested inside mosho group elements to apply common styling and transforms any data xyz and rotxyz transform attributes on the group are applied to the transform attributes of children css notes all slides will have the mosho slide class the current slide is given the mosho active class all others have the mosho inactive class mosho api mosho was designed to fit goals i had a desire to fill i m open to suggestions start mosho prior to this mosho does nothing triggers mosho pre init and mosho post init events on the document jump directly to the specified slide triggers appropriate mosho enter slide id  mosho leave slide id  mosho pre show  and mosho post show events on the document post and pre show events detail parameter contains prevslide the slide object being transitioned from nextslide the slide object being transitioned to looks at current slide and then calls mosho jump appropriately helper functions to add listeners for entering or leaving the specified slides currently it s just a convenient way to attach a collection of callbacks to pre and post init and jump events i have plans to expand functionality later plugin should be an object containing at least one of the following preinit callback postinit callback preshow callback postshow callback get s the scene element object with specified id or returns current slide if no id is given this version of mosho contains the major features i wanted but i ve got more i already want to be adding auto scaling i do like this about impress js and i hope to get around to it next more plugin features in particular i d like to add support for custom scene tree types and clean ways to push and pop element transform and style and states between transitions dynamic scene tree elements supporting runtime insertion and deletion and restructuring of slides and groups seems like a useful feature it s probably going to be my next major update documentation i m fully aware the internal documentation could use work other stuff i m always open to suggestions but i d prefer to add support for highly specialized changes in the form of supporting plugins where possible right now it s under mit

2897506, skiplist  pete goodliffe pete and at and goodliffe net this is a set of stl style c and and skip list containers the skip list is a very useful reasonably fast ordered container the skip list provides fast searching and good insert and erase performance you could consider it an interesting hybrid of a std list and a std set unlike most skip list implementations you can iterate bi directionally unlike traditional skip lists i also provide additional containers providing full random access and multiple identical item containment this implementation provides a familiar c and and interface with birectional iterators and compatibility with stl algorithms it should drop cleanly into any modern c and and project following the freaky stl container names this container might be better named uniquesortedlist or sortedlist or somesuch other drivel in the interests of clarity and my own sanity i have called it skiplist examples skiplist int list list insert  list insert  list insert  std copy list begin  list end  std ostreamiterator int std cout n there are several containers provided here skiplist the basic skip list provides bidirectional iteration only allows you to insert a value into the list once the api is akin to std list and std set multisliplist as multiset is to set this is a skip list that allows to you insert the same value multiple times also provides bidirectional iteration supports the additional operations provides by multiset count lowerbound upperbound equalrange randomaccessskiplist a skip list variant that provides fast random access via indexing i e operator and a full random access iterator this provides many of the benefits of std vector but with stable items in the list hence non invalidating iterators and iterator mathematics the basic skiplist provides the best performance at the cost of fewer features the multiskiplist works slightly slower to provide multiple identical item insertion the randomaccessskiplist uses a little more memory to support fast random access performance  in the test set i include a simple benchmarking test comparing the skiplist against other stl data structures for working with an ordered set of data compatibility  i have tested this container on mac os using xcode   windows using visual studio  linux using gcc   i have not yet provided c and and  move or initializerlist operations usage notes  the only file you really care about looking at is skiplist h everything else in this directory is supporting gumph to use this container in your project just copy over that file in debug builds if you define debug then a number of diagnostcs are enabled in the container that may affect performance slightly i use the catch unit test framework to run my tests the single header version of this is included in the repository catch to compile the benchmarks i make use of the boost library i don t include boost boost in this repository the easiest way to use boost here is to copy to boost header file directory i e the boostroot and boost directory into this project directory documentation  i ve documented parts of the source in doxygen syntax but i ve not gone to town with this the interface will be perfectly familiar to a c and and programmer feel free to incorporate this code in your own applications i d appreciate hearing from you if you do so it s nice to know that i ve been helpful attribution is welcomed but not required copyright c   pete goodliffe all rights reserved release notes  this is still a work in progress please check back for updates

1299939, assemblage is a template for the stacey cms i developed it for my online portfolio and it turned out quite nice so i decided to release it as a ready to use template assemblage differs from most static templates in that it generates layouts for project indices dynamically using client side scripting in this sense i tend to see it as a kind of other half for the stacey cms stacey organizing and providing the static content and assemblage presenting it in a dynamic and efficient way almost all of the navigation and layout in the main page is build on top of javascript and jquery a special layout plugin has been developed for this purpose which will be released separately once it is more thoroughly evaluated  based on ideas from jquery masonry  and vgrid  the concept behind these plugins is to arrange a collection of elements in a layout that is as spatially efficient as possible while maintaining their order assemblage draws on this principle to produce an arrangement of project and and or category snapshots on screen essentially generating a composition that uniquely identifies the index page apart from the aesthetic uniqueness the functional benefit of this approach is that screen estate is used optimally and the layout may adapt to various browser widths which makes it compatible with a wide range of devices navigation relies on the concept of filtering when the index page loads all projects are visible as preview boxes sliding the navigation panel and selecting a category or sub category hides all preview boxes except the ones belonging to the selected category clicking on a category will show all of it s items as well as those of all of it s sub categories the same navigational functionality as the home page is provided for every category page with the only difference that the navigation of each category includes only it s own contents the page template on the other hand follows a completely different clean approach that focuses first and foremost on bringing the content forward navigation is there at the end of the project pages the project template also features a nice and clean print style so your content shows best in print as well as on screen partials are available for downloads downloads folder  pdfs linkrolls files in the links folder  video html fragments and inclusion of disqus  powered comments finally it comes along with the dejavu sans typeface  installation following the installation guidelines set by the stacey cms installation of assemblage is a snap just replace your public and templates folders and you re set to go provided that you have the same exhibition names as the original stacey installation e g index html page html assemblage does not require any modification of the core components of stacey that is the and app folder customizing initial order of display the order of the project thumbs can be customized by means of the sortby variable that can be set in the shared txt file this variable takes two possible values date and random copyright c   yiannis chatzikonstantinou all rights reserved redistribution and use in source and binary forms with or without modification are permitted provided that the following conditions are met redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice this list of conditions and the following disclaimer redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and and or other materials provided with the distribution this software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors as is and any express or implied warranties including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed in no event shall the copyright holder or contributors be liable for any direct indirect incidental special exemplary or consequential damages including but not limited to procurement of substitute goods or services loss of use data or profits or business interruption however caused and on any theory of liability whether in contract strict liability or tort including negligence or otherwise arising in any way out of the use of this software even if advised of the possibility of such damage
5210214, potrace js a javascript implementation of peter selinger s raster to vector image implemented in c the vague intention is to eventually create a javascript web app using html canvas either for simple drawings or the option to upload images of reasonable size please heh  and returning svg vector versions which may i point out are built directly into html tested in chrome v    python may have existed at some point developed during hackerschool summer    some implementation details the bitmap object is one of the primitives this essentially represents the image and the methods that a basic image should have the path object is the other primitive it represents a single fully cyclical  dimensional path it can be indexed in either direction for a theoretically infinite number of iterations  and contains the methods necessary to do so note that while a path is aware of its  dimensional nature and therefore indexes to paired xy coordinates it does not have any knowledge of the image to which these coordinates relate indexer objects have two methods called prev and next which return the previous and next indexer objects handy helps avoid that ugly path indexer path mod self start i and  math the bitmap has a descendent called drafter a drafter is aware of the purpose of a path but never generates one only uses them as parameters for operations that alter the image the highest level class is called the pathbuilder the pathbuilder is the object that will handle the creation of the vector paths from start to finish at least at the moment until refactored again p there are currently  implementations of straightener one inside the file straightener naive js and the other inside straightener complex js the two implementations should be invisibly interchangeable both are called using object create and run using its method run at the moment they just return self but later may instead return the array of arrays holding the longest path segments possible from each vertex instead of the entire straightener object of the two implementations the naive one works in o n  time but is fully operational the complex one is operational and now outputs reasonable results however because of the timing notes below the naive implementation will be used until further notice there is an additional helper object called direction it contains the  coordinate directions north south east and west and more importantly handles the meaning of turn left and turn right  a slightly confusing thing about the current implementations deciding whether to make a certain type of turn is a member function of the drafter object because it requires knowledge of the image details deciding which turn to try in the first place called the turn policy is a member of the pathbuilder class because the specific turn policy used is unrelated to the underlying image thoughts should straightness be handled inside pathbuilder objects should we already be expanding into yet another object after all straightness is a detail that uses completed paths not something related to paths the underlying question here is whether paths refers strictly to coordinate based paths or if vector paths are the real meaning in use here  and  and  some timing runs ms with straightener naive avg   ms with straightener complex avg   some possible explanations lack of optimization yet implemented in straightener complex incomplete or incorrect implementation greater startup costs require a larger dataset to reap the benefits of the o n  alg over the o n
