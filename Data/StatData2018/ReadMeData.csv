3755875, please note  skrollr     stand alone parallax scrolling javascript library for mobile android ios etc and desktop in about k minified designer friendly no javascript skills needed just plain css and html actually skrollr is much more than just parallax scrolling it s a full fledged scrolling animation library in fact you can use it and still have no parallax scrolling at all but i wanted to sound hip and use some buzz words by the way skrollr leverages html and css  resources in the wild further resources tutorials etc documentation skrollr allows you to animate any css property of any element depending on the horizontal scrollbar position all you need to do is define key frames for each element at certain points in top scroll offset other libraries require you to write javascript in order to define your animations this introduces two main problems animation and element are not at one place in order to find out if any animations are defined for a given element you have to scroll through many sometimes thousands of lines of javascript you have to learn a new syntax which is often very verbose and limited at the same time with skrollr you put the definition of your key frames right where they belong to the element using a syntax you already know plain css let s get serious first of all you want to include the skrollr min js file at the bottom of your document right before the closing and body and then call skrollr init or you can place it inside the head if you want to but make sure to call init once the document has been loaded e g jquery s ready event or even window onload script type text and javascript var s skrollr init and script if you are using require js to structure your project you can use skrollr as a module as well javascript require skrollr  function skrollr var s skrollr init if you re familiar with css you already know the style attribute in order to create an animation you would need several at least two of them that s what skrollr does you use the html data attributes to define multiple sets of styles we call each of them keyframe and skrollr interpolates between them skrollr ensures that you can actually scroll down  pixels or more even if there s not enough content you can suppress this by using the forceheight option you can t use f or ff you need to use rgb or hsl and explicitly decide which color space you want because they result in different animations hsl is much cooler most of the time don t worry the ie plugin teaches ie  to display rgb and hsl correctly skrollr handles all these nasty css prefixes for you just moz relax and get yourself a cup of webkit coffee skrollr allows non linear animations the so called easing functions can be used per property by putting them in square brackets behind the property there s a built in list of easing functions see below in the javascript javascript section and you can use your own functions by using the easings options now you may have noticed that using  as a keyframe position is kind of random and the look depends on your browser size skrollr keyframes can either be absolute absolute mode or document mode or relative relative mode or viewport mode that s the end of this short intro the following sections will explain some more things in detail mobile support starting with version    skrollr officially supports mobile browsers including android and ios furthermore mobile support has been rewritten from scratch for skrollr    if you re not interested in the details just scroll down a bit to see what you need to do for mobile support some words on why this is an important milestone and why others failed mobile browsers try to save battery wherever they can that s why mobile browsers delay the execution of javascript while you are scrolling ios in particular does this very aggressively and completely stops javascript in short that s the reason why many scrolling libraries either don t work on mobile devices or they come with their own scrollbar which is a usability nightmare on desktop it was an important requirement while i developed skrollr that i don t force you to scroll the way i want it skrollr on desktop uses a native scrollbar and you can scroll the way you want to keyboard mouse etc you just told me it doesn t work on mobile but why does it the answer is simple when using skrollr on mobile you don t actually scroll when detecting a mobile browser skrollr disables native scrolling and instead listens for touch events and moves the content more specific the skrollr body element using css transforms starting with skrollr    there s just one thing you need to do include an element on your page with the id skrollr body that s the element we move in order to fake scrolling the only case where you don t need a skrollr body is when using position fixed exclusively in fact the skrollr website doesn t include a skrollr body element if you need both fixed and non fixed i e static elements put the static ones inside the skrollr body element the skrollr body element might be configured within the init options skrollrinitoptions starting with    there s experimental amd support please note that only skrollr core has amd support so far we will update the plugins in the future require skrollr  function skrollr skrollr init absolute vs relative mode being only able to define key frames in absolute values is simply insufficient for some cases for example if you don t know exactly where an element will be in the document that s why there are two modes for key frames namely absolute and relative mode the key frames are defined as absolute values describing how much the document has been scrolled down the syntax is data offset anchor  where offset can be any integer  is default and anchor can be either start default or end either offset or anchor can be omitted in some situations here are some examples of key frames and their meaning data  data start data  start when the scroll top is  data  data  start when the scroll top is  data  data  start when the scroll top is  sounds like nonsense but keep in mind that interpolation will be relative to this point data end data  end when offset is  but counting from the bottom of the document instead of from the top in short when you reach the bottom of the page data  end px before we reach the bottom data  end px after we reach the bottom again it s up to you whether you need it instead of defining key frames relative to the document i e absolute  we are able to define them depending on the position of any element in relation to the viewport the syntax is data offset viewport anchor element anchor  where offset can again be any integer and defaults to  both viewport anchor mandatory and element anchor optional can be one of top  center or bottom if element anchor is omitted the value of viewport anchor will be taken just like with background position here are some examples of key frames and their meaning data top data  top data top top data  top top when the element s top is aligned with the top of the viewport data  top data  top top when the element s top is px above the top of the viewport data  top data  top top when the element s top is px below the top of the viewport data top bottom data  top bottom when the bottom of the element is at the top of the viewport it s just not visible data center center data  center center when the element is at the center of the viewport data bottom center data  bottom center when the element s center is at the bottom of the viewport thus the upper half of the element is visible by default the keyframes are triggered by the position of the element where the keyframes are described however there are times when the position of a second element should trigger the first element s keyframes the data anchor target attribute can be used in these cases the data anchor target attribute accepts any css selector and the position of the first element on the page matching the selector will be used to trigger keyframes on the element where the attribute is defined data anchor target requires ie  or greater note if you need to support ie  then you may only use ids as anchor target s i e foo the ie plugin maps queryselector to getelementbyid here s an infographic for better understanding of anchors click to open pdf important all those values will be calculated up front and transformed to absolute mode so if either the element s box height changes height padding border or the elements position within the document you probably need to call refresh see documentation in javascript section below window resizing is handled by skrollr percentage offsets  all offsets shown above are given in absolute pixel values e g data  for px from the top or data  top bottom for a px offset to the top bottom anchor as of skrollr    you can also have offsets as percentages of the viewport by appending a p to the number for example data p for when you scrolled down  of the viewport or data p center to have a  offset from the center anchor hash navigation working with constants i was lying to you the syntax for absolute mode is not data offset anchor and for relative mode it s not data offset viewport anchor element anchor in both cases offset can be preceded by a constant which can be passed to the init method the name of the constant needs to be preceded with an underscore skrollr init constants foobar  valid characters for a constant are a z  dynamic constants  starting with skrollr    the word constants doesn t quite fit anymore but who cares you can now use functions and percentages as constants they are automatically evaluated when the window is resized or if you call refresh skrollr init constants foo function and and note you can access the skrollr instance with this for things like this relativetoabsolute return math random  and and trolololol vh p css classes skrollr will add a skrollr class to the html element when calling init and will remove a no skrollr class if present additionally it will add a skrollr desktop or skrollr mobile class depending on which it detects this allows fallback css rules to create a good user experience on unsupported devices or when javascript or skrollr are disabled all elements under skrollr s control elements with appropriate data attributes will get the skrollable class in addition we add either the skrollable before  skrollable between or skrollable after class depending on whether the current scroll position is before between or after the first and last smallest and largest keyframe of an element animating attributes  starting with skrollr    you can also animate attribute and not just style properties this is especially a big thing because in the svg world many properties are implemented as attributes and not in css animating an attribute couldn t be simplier just prefix the property with an symbol points     data  points     data  points     and polygon note as always skrollr doesn t do any magic it doesn t understand what a polygon or points are it s only interpolating numbers that s it so make sure you have the same number of numbers in your keyframes  in this case filling missing values imagine the following animation one could expect left to have a value of  at keyframe  that is not the case by design skrollr only interpolates values between key frames which are direct neighbors what actually happens is that skrollr internally fills out all holes once from left and then from right so the above is equivalent to preventing interpolation the reason why skrollr is so lightweight and powerful is because it literally interpolates every number it can find if you want to prevent some side effect you can suppress interpolation for a specific value by prepending an exclamation point note the values for both keyframes if they contain a number need to be prefixed if you want to avoid skrollr throwing an exception at you limitations there are some limitations of skrollr you should be aware of all numeric values have to have the same unit even  needs a unit it s not possible to animate from  to px skrollr won t complain but results are undefined animations between values which are composed of multiple numeric values like margin     are only possible for the same number of values margin px px px px to margin px px px px is fine but not margin px to margin px px animations between css transforms only work when they use the same functions in same order from rotate deg scale  to rotate deg scale  is fine color animations don t support named values like red or hex values like ff instead you have to use rgb  rgba  hsl and hsla don t worry there s a skrollr plugin for ie  to support hsl without a and to fall rgba back to rgb color animations only work for same color functions hsl to hsl or hsla is fine but not rgb to hsl which makes sense because animating from the same colors in rgb space and in hsl space results in different animations hsl gives you the nice rainbow stuff but feel free to send in a pull request to fix any of them just keep in mind that keeping skrollr as lightweight as possible has high priority javascript on the javascript part there s not much to do you can if you want to so if you only know css and html perfect skrollr init options all there is to do is to call skrollr init options which returns an instance of the singleton skrollr class subsequent calls to init will just return the same skrollr instance again possible options for init are smooth scrolling smoothens your animations when you scroll down  pixels the animations will transition instead of jumping to the new position the global setting can be overridden per element by setting data smooth scrolling to on or off the number of milliseconds the animations run after the scroll position changed the last time an object containing integers as values the keys can contain a z  they do not need a leading underscore example data myconst  and skrollr init constants myconst  result in data  by default skrollr uses the largest key frame and makes document height and viewport height this high thus the max possible scroll top offset if your animation runs too fast or too slow just adjust the scale value scale only affects keyframes in absolute mode when forceheight is set to false scale is ignored scale affects constants as well scale does only affect key frames in absolute mode e g data  but not data top true make sure the document is high enough that all key frames fit inside example you use data   but the content only makes the document px high skrollr will ensure that you can scroll down the whole px or if you use relative mode e g data top bottom  skrollr will make sure the bottom of the element can actually reach the top of the viewport false don t manipulate the document and just keep the natural scrollbar this option allows you to pass a function to skrollr overwriting the check for mobile devices the function should return true when mobile scrolling should be used and false if not the default looks like this function return and android and iphone and ipad and ipod and blackberry and i test navigator useragent and and navigator vendor and and window opera the amount of deceleration for momentum scrolling on mobile devices this options tells skrollr how fast or slow you want the scrolling to stop after the user lifted his finger set it to  to disable momentum scrolling this option allows you to override the default id selector used for supporting mobile browsers it might come in handy when the element in question already has a assigned id or if you would like to define more then one skrollrbody depending on preceding javascript logic this option specifies how to handle animations when the scroll position is outside the range on the keyframes i e before the first or after the last keyframe one of three options are possible set  default  when before and after the first and last keyframe apply the styles of the first and last keyframe to the element ease same as set but the values will be transformed using the given easing function reset when before and after the first and last keyframe apply the styles which the element had before skrollr did anything this means resetting the class attribute as well as removing all styles which have been applied to the style property this means the element won t have any skrollable css classes given the following element with two keyframes and the following easing function which always returns   i know it s pointless but it s just an example a real world example would be an easing function that represents a curve and starts somewhere between  and   but not at  function p return   and imagine the scrollbar is at   which is below the first keyframe which is at  a listener function that gets called each time right before we render everything the function will be passed an object with the following properties curtop  and and the current scroll top offset lasttop  and and the top value of last time maxtop  and and the max value you can scroll to curtop and maxtop will give you the current progress direction down and and either up or down returning false will prevent rendering a listener function that gets called right after we finished rendering everything the function will be passed with the same parameters as beforerender skrollr init render function data and and log the current scroll position console log data curtop experimental in order to receive keyframe events from an element add the data emit events attribute to the element the keyframe function will be called with three arguments  the element that passed the keyframe  the name of the keyframe camel cased see example  the direction the user is scrolling data  data top bottom data offset center data emit events some content skrollr init keyframe function element name direction and and name will be one of data datatopbottom dataoffsetcenter note this is experimental expect the api to change originally i wanted to emit the events right on the element so you could do this and and wouldn t this be nice document queryselector foo addeventlistener skrollr datatopbottom up  function and and foo just passed the data top bottom keyframe while scrolling up  false an object defining new easing functions or overwriting existing ones easing functions get just one argument which is a value between  and  the percentage of how much of the animation is done the function should return a value between  and  as well but for some easings a value less than  or greater than  is just fine an easing function basically transforms the timeline for an animation when the animation should be  done you can transform it to be  done or whatever your function does skrollr init easing and and this easing will sure drive you crazy wtf math random inverted function p return  p you can now use the easing functions like any other skrollr ships with some built in functions linear the default doesn t need to be specified quadratic to the power of two so  looks like  cubic to the power of three so  looks like   begin and end they always return  or  respectively no animation swing slow at the beginning and accelerates at the end so           sqrt square root starts fast slows down at the end outcubic custom easing insert the given polynomial coeficients instead of t t t t and t t p p p p p and t p p p p and t p p p and t p p and t p example shown with the values for easeoutelasticbig easeoutelasticbig function p return  p p p p p  p p p p and  p p p  p p and  p skrollr get returns the skrollr instance if init has been called before or undefined public api calling init returns an instance of skrollr which exposes a public api reparses all given elements you can pass a single element or an array like element array nodelist or jquery object useful when elements in relative mode change and need to be updated data attributes are manipulated dynamically new elements are added to the dom and should be controlled by skrollr when no elements are given all elements in the document will be parsed again in fact when calling skrollr init skrollr uses refresh without parameters internally time consuming operations should not be called on every rendering returns an integer which represents the absolute scroll position which correlates to the relative anchor element must be a dom element viewportanchor and elementanchor must be one of top  center or bottom var offset s relativetoabsolute document getelementbyid foo  top  bottom and and offset contains the scroll position at which foo s bottom is at the top of the viewport and and if you now use setscrolltop offset or animateto offset foo s bottom will be perfectly aligned with the top of the viewport yay returns the current scroll offset in pixels normalizes different browser quirks and handles mobile scrolling returns the number of pixels that can be scrolled down in total if forceheight is true that s usually the largest keyframe otherwise it s the height of the document minus the viewport height sets the top offset using window scrollto  top on desktop or updating the internal state in case of mobile scrolling when force is set to true  skrollr will jump to the new position without any kind of transition by default the global smoothscrolling setting applies returns if skrollr runs in mobile mode see also mobilecheck option animates the scroll position from current position to top possible options are how long the animation should run in milliseconds the default is  or one second the name of an easing function the same functions can be used as for property animations default is linear a function to be called after the animation finished when you pass a top value which is the same as the current then the function will be called immediately the function gets a boolean argument interrupted which indicates if the animation was interrupted by stopanimateto or finished to the end stops the animation and calls the done callback passing true as interrupted arguments returns if an animation caused by animateto is running set a listener function for one of the events described in the options section beforerender render keyframe only one listener can be attached at a given time this method overwrites the current listener if any removes the listener for the given event destroys skrollr all class and style attributes will be set to the values they had before changelog

41717707, by leon a gatys alexander s ecker and matthias bethge the paper presents an algorithm for combining the content of one image with the style of another image using convolutional neural networks here s an example that maps the artistic style of onto a night time photograph of the stanford campus applying the style of different images to the same content image gives interesting results here we reproduce figure  from the paper which renders a photograph of the tubingen in germany in a variety of styles here are the results of applying the style of various pieces of artwork to this photograph of the golden gate bridge the algorithm allows the user to trade off the relative weight of the style and content reconstruction terms by resizing the style image before extracting style features we can control the types of artistic features that are transfered from the style image you can control this behavior with the stylescale flag below we see three examples of rendering the golden gate bridge in the style of the starry night from left to right stylescale is     and   you can use more than one style image to blend multiple artistic styles clockwise from upper left the starry night and the scream  the scream and composition vii  seated nude and composition vii  and seated nude and the starry night when using multiple style images you can control the degree to which they are blended if you add the flag originalcolors  then the output image will retain the colors of the original image dependencies optional dependencies for cuda backend cuda   and for cudnn backend for opencl backend after installing dependencies you ll need to run the following script to download the vgg model sh models and downloadmodels sh leon gatys has graciously provided the modified

original vgg  model you can also try the normalized vgg  model used in the paper pooling the type of pooling layers to use one of max or avg default is max the vgg  models uses max pooling layers but the paper mentions that replacing these layers with average pooling layers can improve the results i haven t been able to get good results using average pooling but the option is here backend nn  cudnn  or clnn default is nn cudnn requires cudnnautotune when using the cudnn backend pass this flag to use the built in cudnn autotuner to select the best convolution algorithms for your

update the image packge to the latest version luarocks install image problem running without a gpu gives an error message complaining about cutorch not found solution pass the flag gpu  when running in cpu only mode problem the program runs out of memory and dies solution try reducing the image size imagesize  or lower note that different image sizes will likely require non default values for styleweight and contentweight for optimal results if you are running on a gpu you can also try running with backend cudnn to reduce memory usage problem get the following error message models and

selected also make sure the correct parameters for contentlayers and stylelayers are set see opencl usage example above problem backend cudnn is slower than default nn backend solution add the flag cudnnautotune this will use the built in cudnn autotuner to select the best convolution algorithms by default neural style uses the nn backend for convolutions and l bfgs for optimization these give good results but can both use a lot of memory you can reduce memory usage with the following use cudnn add the flag backend cudnn to use the cudnn backend this will only work in gpu mode use adam add the flag optimizer adam to use adam instead of l bfgs this should significantly reduce memory usage but may require tuning of other parameters for good results in particular you should play with the learning rate content weight style weight and also consider using gradient normalization this should work in both cpu and gpu modes reduce image size if the above tricks are not enough you can reduce the size of the generated image pass the flag imagesize  to generate an image at half the default size with the default settings neural style uses about  gb of gpu memory on my system switching to adam and cudnn reduces the gpu memory footprint to about gb speed can vary a lot depending on the backend and the optimizer here are some times for running  iterations with imagesize  on a maxwell

remaining layers should be computed on gpu  you will need to tune the multigpustrategy for your setup in order to achieve maximal resolution we can achieve very high quality results at high resolution

pretty much everything you ve used phantomjs nightmarejs or selenium for before json of google results examples and extract google results js google for chromeless and get a list of json results screenshot of google results examples and google screenshot js google for chromeless and take a screenshot of the results see the full examples list and examples for more  how it works how it works  installation installation  usage usage  api documentation api documentation  configuring development environment configuring development environment  faq faq  contributors contributors  credits credits  help community help and community with chromeless you can control chrome open website click elements fill out forms using an elegant api docs and api md this is useful for integration tests or any other scenario where you d need to script a real browser  running chrome on your local computer  running chrome on aws lambda and controlling it remotely for local development purposes where a fast feedback loop is necessary the easiest way to use chromeless is by controlling your local chrome browser just follow the usage guide usage to get started chromeless comes out of the box with a remote proxy built in the usage stays completely the same this way you can write and run your tests locally and have them be executed remotely on aws lambda the proxy connects to lambda through a websocket connection to forward commands and return the evaluation results npm install chromeless  deploy the proxy service to aws lambda more details here serverless setup  follow the usage instructions here serverless using the proxy using chromeless is similar to other browser automation tools for example const chromeless require chromeless async function run const chromeless new chromeless const screenshot await chromeless type chromeless  input name q press  wait resultstats screenshot console log screenshot and and prints local file path or s url await chromeless end run catch console error bind console to run chromeless locally you need a recent version of chrome or chrome canary installed version  or greater by default chromeless will start chrome automatically and will default to the most recent version found on your system if there s multiple you can override this behavior by starting chrome yourself and passing a flag of launchchrome false in the chromeless constructor to launch chrome yourself and open the port for chromeless follow this example alias canary and applications and google chrome canary app and contents and macos and google chrome canary canary remote debugging port  or run chrome canary headless ly canary remote debugging port  disable gpu headless or run chrome headless ly on windows cd c program files x google chrome application chrome remote debugging port  disable gpu headless follow the setup instructions here serverless installation then using chromeless with the proxy service is the same as running it locally with the exception of the remote option alternatively you can configure the proxy service s endpoint with environment variables here s how serverless using the proxy const chromeless new chromeless remote apikey your api key here  chromeless constructor options chromeless methods chrome methods requirements nodejs version   and greater  clone this repository  run npm install  to build npm run build  go to this repository locally  run npm link  go to the folder housing your chromeless scripts  run npm link chromeless now your local chromeless scripts will use your local development of chromeless the compute price is   per gb s and the free tier provides  gb s the request price is   per  million requests and the free tier provides m requests per month this means you can easily execute   tests for free in the free tier although chromeless is the easiest way to get started running chrome on lambda you may not have time to build and manage your own visual testing toolkit commercial options

781028, node inspector is a debugger interface for node js applications that uses the blink developer tools formerly webkit web inspector quick start quick start features features known issues known issues troubleshooting troubleshooting advanced use advanced use configuration configuration contributing contributing code credits credits npm install g node inspector node debug app js where app js is the name of your main node application javascript file the node debug command will load node inspector in your default browser note node inspector works in chrome and opera only you have to re open the inspector page in one of those browsers if another browser is your default web browser e g safari or internet explorer node inspector works almost exactly as the chrome developer tools read the excellent to get started other useful resources documentation specific to node inspector provided by strongloop miroslav s talk most likely outdated by now on wiki most likely outdated by now the blink devtools debugger is a powerful javascript debugger interface node inspector supports almost all of the debugging features of devtools including navigate in your source files set breakpoints and specify trigger conditions step over step in step out resume continue inspect scopes variables object properties hover your mouse over an expression in your source to display its value in a tooltip edit variables and object properties continue to location break on exceptions disable and enable all breakpoints cpu and heap profiling network client requests inspection console output inspection node inspector uses websockets so no polling for breaks remote debugging and debugging remote machine optionally persisting changes back to the file system set breakpoints in files that are not loaded into v yet useful for debugging module loading and initialization embeddable in other applications see embedding howto docs and embedding md for more details be careful about viewing the contents of buffer objects each byte is displayed as an individual array element for most buffers this will take too long to render while not stopped at a breakpoint the console doesn t always behave as you might expect see the break on uncaught exceptions does not work in all node versions you need at least v   see debugging multiple processes e g cluster is cumbersome read the following blog post for instructions the debugged process must be started with debug brk  this way the script is paused on the first line note node debug adds this option for you by default when in doubt refresh the page in browser yes node inspector must be running on the same machine but your browser can be anywhere just make sure port  is accessible and if node inspector is not running on your remote machine you can also debug it as long as your local machine can connect it in this way you must launch node inspector with no inject which means some features are not supported such as profiling and consoling output inspection so how to debug remote machine with your local node inspector node inspector debug host     no inject then open the url node inspector no inject then specify the remote machine address as a host parameter in the url create a json encoded array you must escape quote characters when using a command line option node inspector hidden nodemodules and framework note that the array items are interpreted as regular expressions make sure that you have adblock disabled as well as any other content blocking scripts and plugins you may want to delete debug session metadata if for example node inspector gets in a bad state with some watch variables that were function calls possibly into some special c bindings in such cases even restarting the application and debug session may not fix the problem node inspector stores debug session metadata in the html local storage you can inspect the contents of local storage and remove any items as needed in google chrome you can execute any of the following in the javascript console and and remove all window localstorage clear and and or to list keys so you can selectively remove them with removeitem window localstorage and and remove all the watch expressions window localstorage removeitem watchexpressions and and remove all the breakpoints window localstorage removeitem breakpoints when you are done cleaning up hit refresh in the browser try setting no preload to true this option disables searching disk for js at startup code will still be loaded into node inspector at runtime as modules are required you have to start mocha as the debugged process and make sure the execution pauses on the first line this way you have enough time to set your breakpoints before the tests are run node debug mocha if you are running on a unix system you can simply run the following command the which statement gets replaced with the full path to the gulp cli node debug which gulp task if you are running on windows you have to get the full path of gulp js to make an equivalent command node debug appdata npm nodemodules gulp bin gulp js task you can omit the task part to run the default task while running node debug is a convenient way to start your debugging session there may come time when you need to tweak the default setup there are three steps needed to get you up and debugging node inspector you can leave the server running in background it s possible to debug multiple processes using the same server instance you can either start node with a debug flag like node debug your and node and program js or to pause your script on the first line node debug brk your and short and node and script js or you can enable debugging on a node that is already running by sending it a signal  get the pid of the node process using your favorite method pgrep or ps ef are good sh pgrep l node  node your and node and server js  send it the usr signal sh kill s usr  windows does not support unix signals to enable debugging you can use an undocumented api function process debugprocess pid  get the pid of the node process using your favorite method e g sh tasklist and fi imagename eq node exe image name pid session name session mem usage  node exe  console   k  call the api sh node e process debugprocess  to manage configuration options places for configuration environment variables prefixed with node inspector if you passed an

1136075, h id intro iscroll smooth scrolling for the web and h iscroll is a high performance small footprint dependency free multi platform javascript scroller it works on desktop mobile and smart tv it has been vigorously optimized for performance and size so to offer the smoothest result on modern and old devices alike iscroll does not just scroll it can handle any element that needs to be moved with user interaction it adds scrolling zooming panning infinite scrolling parallax scrolling carousels to your projects and manages to do that in just kb give it a broom and it will also clean up your office even on platforms where native scrolling is good enough iscroll adds features that wouldn t be possible otherwise specifically granular control over the scroll position even during momentum you can always get and set the xy coordinates of the scroller animation can be customized with user defined easing functions bounce elastic back you can easily hook to a plethora of custom events onbeforescrollstart onscrollstart onscroll onscrollend flick out of the box multi platform support from older android devices to the latest iphone from chrome to internet explorer h id iscroll versions the many faces of iscroll and h iscroll is all about optimization to reach the highest performance it has been divided into multiple versions you can pick the version that better suits your need currently we have the following fragrances iscroll js  it is the general purpose script it includes the most commonly used features and grants very high performance in a small footprint iscroll lite js  it is a stripped down version of the main script it doesn t support snap scrollbars mouse wheel key bindings but if all you need is scrolling especially on mobile iscroll lite is the smallest fastest solution iscroll probe js  probing the current scroll position is a demanding task that s why i decided to build a dedicated version for it if you need to know the scrolling position at any given time this is the iscroll for you i m making some more tests this might end up in the regular iscroll js script so keep an eye on it iscroll zoom js  adds zooming to the standard scroll iscroll infinite js  can do infinite and cached scrolling handling very long lists of elements is no easy task for mobile devices iscroll infinite uses a caching mechanism that lets you scroll a potentially infinite number of elements h id getting started getting started and h so you want to be an iscroll master cool because that is what i ll make you into iscroll is a class that needs to be initiated for each scrolling area there s no limit to the number of iscrolls you can have in each page if not that imposed by the device cpu and memory try to keep the dom as simple as possible iscroll uses the hardware compositing layer but there s a limit to the elements the hardware can handle the optimal html structure is li and li li and li  and ul iscroll must be applied to the wrapper of the scrolling area in the above example the ul element will be scrolled only the first child of the container element is scrolled additional children are simply ignored the minimal call to initiate the script is as follow script type text and javascript var myscroll new iscroll wrapper and script the first parameter can be a string representing the dom selector of the scroll container element or a reference to the element itself the following is a valid syntax too var wrapper document getelementbyid wrapper var myscroll new iscroll wrapper so basically either you pass the element directly or a string that will be given to queryselector consequently to select a wrapper by its class name instead of the id you d do var myscroll new iscroll wrapper note that iscroll uses queryselector not queryselectorall  so only the first occurrence of the selector is used if you need to apply iscroll to multiple objects you ll have to build your own cycle h id initialization initialization and h the iscroll needs to be initiated when the dom is ready the safest bet is to start it on window onload event domcontentloaded or inline initialization are also fine but remember that the script needs to know the height and width of the scrolling area if you have images that don t have explicit width and height declaration iscroll will most likely end up with a wrong scroller size to sum up the smallest iscroll configuration is script type text and javascript var myscroll function loaded myscroll new iscroll wrapper and script body onload loaded li and li li and li  and ul h id configuring configuring the iscroll and h iscroll can be configured by passing a second parameter during the initialization phase var myscroll new iscroll wrapper  mousewheel true scrollbars true the example above turns on mouse wheel support and scrollbars after initialization you can access the normalized values from the options object eg console dir myscroll options the above will return the configuration the myscroll instance will run on by normalized i mean that if you set usetransform true for example but the browser doesn t support css transforms usetransform will be false h id the core understanding the core and h iscroll uses various techniques to scroll based on device and browser capability normally you don t need to configure the engine  iscroll is smart enough to pick the best for you nonetheless it is important to understand which mechanisms iscroll works on and how to configure them by default the engine uses the transform css property setting this to false scrolls like we were in  ie using the top and left and thus the scroller needs to be absolutely positioned this might be useful when scrolling sensitive content such as flash iframes and videos but be warned performance loss is huge default true iscroll uses css transition to perform animations momentum and bounce by setting this to false  requestanimationframe is used instead on modern browsers the difference is barely noticeable on older devices transitions perform better default true this option tries to put the scroller on the hardware layer by appending translatez  to the transform css property this greatly increases performance especially on mobile but there are situations where you might want to disable it notably if you have too many elements and the hardware can t catch up default true h id basic features basic features and h when the scroller meets the boundary it performs a small bounce animation disabling bounce may help reach smoother results on old or slow devices default true to override the native scrolling iscroll has to inhibit some default browser behaviors such as mouse clicks if you want your application to respond to the click event you have to explicitly set this option to true please note that it is suggested to use the custom tap event instead see below default false by default iscroll listens to all pointer events and reacts to the first one that occurs it may seem a waste of resources but feature detection has proven quite unreliable and this listen to all approach is our safest bet for wide browser and device compatibility if you have an internal mechanism for device detection or you know in advance where your script will run on you may want to disable all event sets you don t need mouse pointer or touch events for example to disable mouse and pointer events var myscroll new iscroll wrapper  disablemouse true disablepointer true default false sometimes you want to preserve native vertical scroll but being able to add an horizontal iscroll maybe a carousel set this to true and the iscroll area will react to horizontal swipes only vertical swipes will naturally scroll the whole page this is useful mainly on d scrollers when you need to scroll both horizontally and vertically normally when you start scrolling in one direction the other is locked default false set this to true to activate keyboard and remote controls interaction see the key bindings key bindings section below for more information default false meaningful when mouse wheel support is activated in which case it just inverts the scrolling direction ie going down scrolls up and vice versa default false you can turn on and off the momentum animation performed when the user quickly flicks on screen turning this off greatly enhances performance default true listen to the mouse wheel event default false whether or not to preventdefault when events are fired this should be left true unless you really know what you are doing see preventdefaultexception in the advanced options advanced options for more control over the preventdefault behavior default true wheter or not to display the default scrollbars see more in the scrollbar scrollbar section default false see also the freescroll option default scrollx false  scrolly true by default iscroll starts at   top left position you can instruct the scroller to kickoff at a different location default  set this to true to let iscroll emit a custom tap event when the scroll area is clicked and tapped but not scrolled this is the suggested way to handle user interaction with clickable elements to listen to the tap event you would add an event listener as you would do for a standard event example element addeventlistener tap  dosomething false native element on tap  dosomething jquery you can also customize the event name by passing a string eg tap mycustomtapevent in this case you d listen to mycustomtapevent default false h id scrollbars scrollbars and h the scrollbars are more than just what the name suggests in fact internally they are referenced as indicators an indicator listens to the scroller position and normally it just shows its position in relation to whole but what it can do is so much more let s start with the basis as we mentioned in the basic features section basic features there s only one thing that you got to do to activate the scrollbars in all their splendor and that one thing is var myscroll new iscroll wrapper  scrollbars true of course the default behavior can be personalized when not in use the scrollbar fades away leave this to false to spare resources default false the scrollbar becomes draggable and user can interact with it default false the scrollbar size changes based on the proportion between the wrapper and the scroller width and height setting this to false makes the scrollbar a fixed size this might be useful in case of custom styled scrollbars see below styling the scrollbar default true when scrolling outside of the boundaries the scrollbar is shrunk by a small amount valid values are clip and scale clip just moves the indicator outside of its container the impression is that the scrollbar shrinks but it is simply moving out of the screen if you can live with the visual effect this option immensely improves overall performance scale turns off usetransition hence all animations are served with requestanimationframe the indicator is actually varied in size and the end result is nicer to the eye default false h id styling the scrollbar styling the scrollbar and h so you don t like the default scrollbar styling and you think you could do better help yourself iscroll makes dressing the scrollbar a snap first of all set the scrollbars option to custom var myscroll new iscroll wrapper  scrollbars custom then use the following css classes to style the little bastards iscrollhorizontalscrollbar  this is applied to the horizontal container the element that actually hosts the scrollbar indicator iscrollverticalscrollbar  same as above but for the vertical container iscrollindicator  the actual scrollbar indicator iscrollbothscrollbars  this is added to the container elements when both scrollbars are shown normally just one horizontal or vertical is visible if you set resizescrollbars false you could make the scrollbar of a fixed size otherwise it would be resized based on the scroller length please keep reading to the following section for a revelation that will shake your world h id indicators indicators and h all the scrollbar options above are in reality just wrappers to the low level indicators option it looks more or less like this var myscroll new iscroll wrapper  indicators el element and element selector fade false ignoreboundaries false interactive false listenx true listeny true resize true shrink false speedratiox  speedratioy  this is a mandatory parameter which holds a reference to the scrollbar container element the first child inside the container will be the indicator note that the scrollbar can be anywhere on your document it doesn t need to be inside the scroller wrapper do you start perceiving the power of such tool valid syntax would be indicators el document getelementbyid indicator or simply indicators el indicator this tells the indicator to ignore the boundaries imposed by its container since we can alter the speed ratio of the scrollbar it is useful to just let the scrollbar go say you want the indicator to go twice as fast as the scroller it would reach the end of its run very quickly this option is used for parallax scrolling parallax scrolling default false to which axis the indicator listens to it can be just one or both default true the speed the indicator moves in relation to the main scroller size by default this is set automatically you rarely need to alter this value default  these are the same options we explored in the scrollbars section scrollbars  i m not going to insult your intelligence and repeat them here the wittiest of you would have noticed that indicators is actually plural yes exactly passing an array of objects you can have a virtually infinite number of indicators i don t know what you may need them for but hey who am i to argue about your scrollbar preferences parallax scrolling is just a collateral damage of the indicators indicators functionality an indicator is just a layer that follows the movement and animation applied to the main scroller if you see it like that you ll understand the power behind this feature to this add that you can have any number of indicators and the parallax scrolling is served you silly of course you can scroll programmaticaly say your iscroll instance resides into the myscroll variable you can easily scroll to any position with the following syntax myscroll scrollto   that would scroll down by  pixels remember  is always the top left corner to scroll you have to pass negative numbers time and easing are optional they regulates the duration in ms and the easing function of the animation respectively the easing functions are available in the iscroll utils ease object for example to apply a  second elastic easing you d do myscroll scrollto    iscroll utils ease elastic the available options are quadratic  circular  back  bounce  elastic same as above but x and y are relative to the current position myscroll scrollby   would scroll  pixels down if you are at  you ll end up at  you re gonna like this sit tight the only mandatory parameter is el pass an element or a selector and iscroll will try to scroll to the top and left of that element time is optional and sets the animation duration easing works the same way as per the scrollto method h id snap snap and h iscroll can snap to fixed positions and elements the simplest snap config is as follow var myscroll new iscroll wrapper  snap true this would automatically split the scroller into pages the size of the container snap also takes a string as a value the string will be the selector to the elements the scroller will be snapped to so the following var myscroll new iscroll wrapper  snap li would snap to each and every li tag to help you navigate through the snap points iscroll grants access to a series of interesting methods x and y represent the page number you want to scroll to in the horizontal or vertical axes yeah it s the plural of axis  i checked if the scroller in mono dimensional just pass  to the axis you don t need time is the duration of the animation easing the easing function used to scroll to the point refer to the option bounceeasing in the advanced options advanced options they are both optional myscroll gotopage    this would scroll to the th page on the horizontal axis in  second go to the next and previous page based on current position h id zoom zoom and h to use the pinch and zoom functionality you better use the iscroll zoom js script set this to true to activate zoom default false maximum zoom level default  minimum zoom level default  starting zoom level default  wheel action can be set to zoom to have the wheel regulate the zoom level instead of scrolling position default undefined ie the mouse wheel scrolls to sum up a nice zoom config would be myscroll new iscroll wrapper  zoom true mousewheel true wheelaction zoom juicy method that lets you zoom programmatically scale is the zoom factor x and y the focus point aka the center of the zoom if not specified the center of the screen will be used time is the duration of the animation in milliseconds optional h id infinite scrolling infinite scrolling and h iscroll integrates a smart caching system that allows to handle of a virtually infinite amount of data using and reusing just a bunch of elements infinite scrolling is in an early stage of development and although it can be considered stable it is not ready for wide consumption i will add more details as soon as the functionality evolves h id advanced options advanced options and h for the hardcore developer the move event is normally bound to the document and not the scroll container when you move the cursor and finger out of the wrapper the scrolling keeps going this is usually what you want but you can also bind the move event to wrapper itself doing so as soon as the pointer leaves the container the scroll stops default false bounceeasing is a bit smarter than that you can also feed a custom easing function like so bounceeasing style cubic bezier   fn function k return k the above would perform a linear easing the style option is used every time the animation is executed with css transitions fn is used with requestanimationframe if the easing function is too complex and can t be represented by a cubic bezier just pass empty string as style note that bounce and elastic can t be performed by css transitions default circular duration in millisecond of the bounce animation default  this value can be altered to change the momentum animation duration and speed higher numbers make the animation shorter sensible results can be experienced starting with a value of    bigger than that basically doesn t make any momentum at all default   set the speed of the mouse wheel default  these are all the exceptions when preventdefault would be fired anyway despite the preventdefault option value this is a pretty powerful option if you don t want to preventdefault on all elements with formfield class name for example you could pass the following preventdefaultexception classname and and s formfield s and and default tagname and input and textarea and button and select and when you resize the window iscroll has to recalculate elements position and dimension this might be a pretty daunting task for the poor little fella to give it some rest the polling is set to  milliseconds by reducing this value you get better visual effect but the script becomes more aggressive on the cpu the default value seems a good compromise default  h id refresh mastering the refresh method and h iscroll needs to know the exact dimensions of both the wrapper and the scroller they are computed at start up but if your elements change in size we need to tell iscroll that you are messing with the dom this is achieved by calling the refresh method with the right timing please follow me closely understanding this will save you hours of frustration every time you touch the dom the browser renderer repaints the page once this repaint has happened we can safely read the new dom properties the repaint phase is not instantaneous and it happens only at the end of the scope that triggered it that s why we need to give the renderer a little rest before refreshing the iscroll to ensure that javascript gets the updated properties you should defer the refresh with something like this ajax page php  oncompletion function oncompletion and and update here your dom settimeout function myscroll refresh   we have placed the refresh call into a zero timeout that is likely all you need to correctly refresh the iscroll boundaries there are other ways to wait for the repaint but the zero timeout has proven pretty solid h id custom events custom events and h iscroll also emits some useful custom events you can hook to to register them you use the on type fn method myscroll new iscroll wrapper myscroll on scrollend  dosomething the above code executes the dosomething function every time the content stops scrolling the available types are beforescrollstart  executed as soon as user touches the screen but before the scrolling has initiated scrollcancel  scroll initiated but didn t happen scrollstart  the scroll started scroll  the content is scrolling available only in scroll probe js edition see onscroll event onscroll scrollend  content stopped scrolling flick  user flicked left and right zoomstart  user started zooming zoomend  zoom ended h id onscroll onscroll event and h the scroll event is available on iscroll probe edition only iscroll probe js the probe behavior can be altered through the probetype option this regulates the probe aggressiveness or the frequency at which the scroll event is fired valid values are      the higher the number the more aggressive the probe the more aggressive the probe the higher the impact on the cpu probetype  has no impact on performance the scroll event is fired only when the scroller is not busy doing its stuff probetype  always executes the scroll event except during momentum and bounce this resembles the native onscroll event probetype  emits the scroll event with a to the pixel precision note that the scrolling is forced to requestanimationframe ie usetransition false h id key bindings key bindings and h you can activate support for keyboards and remote controls with the keybindings option by default iscroll listens to the arrow keys page up and down home and end but they are wait for it totally customizable you can pass an object with the list of key codes you want iscroll to react to the default values are as follow keybindings pageup  pagedown  end  home  left  up  right  down  you can also pass a string eg pageup a and iscroll will convert it for you you could just think of a key code and iscroll would read it out of your mind h id scroller info useful scroller info and h iscroll stores many useful information that you can use to augment your application you will probably find useful myscroll x and y  current position myscroll directionx and y  last direction  down and right  still  up and left myscroll currentpage  current snap point info these pieces of information may be useful when dealing with custom events eg myscroll new iscroll wrapper myscroll on scrollend  function if this x  and and do something the above executes some code if the x position is lower than px when the scroller stops note that i used this instead of myscroll  you can use both of course but iscroll passes itself as this context when firing custom event functions h id destroy destroy and h the public destroy method can be used to free some memory when the iscroll is not needed anymore myscroll destroy myscroll null h id contributing contributing and cla and h as an end user you have to do nothing of course actually the cla ensures that nobody will even come after you asking for your first born for using the iscroll please note that pull requests may take some time to be accepted testing iscroll is one of the most time consuming tasks of the project iscroll works from desktop to smartphone from tablets to smart tvs i do not have physical access to all the testing devices so before i can push a change i have to make sure that the new code is working everywhere critical bugs are usually applied very quickly but enhancements and coding style changes have to pass a longer review phase remember that this is still a side project for me h id whos who is using iscroll and h it s impossible to track all the websites and applications that use the iscroll it has been spotted on

getfood food if food var snack friskies return snack return snack getfood false and and undefined however observe what happens when we replace var using let javascript let snack meow mix function getfood food if food let snack friskies return snack return snack getfood false and and meow mix this change in behavior highlights that we need to be careful when refactoring legacy code which uses var blindly replacing instances of var with let may lead to unexpected behavior note let and const are block scoped therefore referencing block scoped identifiers before they are defined will produce a referenceerror javascript console log x and and referenceerror x is not defined let x hi best practice leave var declarations inside of legacy code to denote that it needs to be carefully refactored when working on a new codebase use let for variables that will change their value over time and const for variables which cannot be reassigned sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup a common use of immediately invoked function expressions is to enclose values within its scope in es we now have the ability to create block based scopes and therefore are not limited purely to function based scope javascript function var food meow mix console log food and and reference error using es blocks javascript let food meow mix console log food and and reference error sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup often times we have nested functions in which we would like to preserve the context of this from its lexical scope an example is shown below javascript function person name this name name person prototype prefixname function arr return arr map function character return this name and character and and cannot read property name of undefined one common solution to this problem is to store the context of this using a variable javascript function person name this name name person prototype prefixname function arr var that this and and store the context of this return arr map function character return that name and character we can also pass in the proper context of this javascript function person name this name name person prototype prefixname function arr return arr map function character return this name and character  this as well as bind the context javascript function person name this name name person prototype prefixname function arr return arr map function character return this name and character bind this using arrow functions  the lexical value of this isn t shadowed and we can re write the above as shown javascript function person name this name name person prototype prefixname function arr return arr map character this name and character best practice use arrow functions whenever you need to preserve the lexical value of this arrow functions are also more concise when used in function expressions which simply return a value javascript var squares arr map function x return x x and and function expression javascript const arr      const squares arr map x x x and and arrow function for terser implementation best practice use arrow functions in place of function expressions when possible sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup with es the standard library has grown immensely along with these changes are new methods which can be used on strings such as includes and repeat javascript var string food var substring foo console log string indexof substring  instead of checking for a return value  to denote string containment we can simply use includes which will return a boolean javascript const string food const substring foo console log string includes substring and and true javascript function repeat string count var strings while strings length count strings push string return strings join in es we now have access to a terser implementation javascript and and string repeat numberofrepetitions meow repeat  and and meowmeowmeow using template literals  we can now construct strings that have special characters in them without needing to escape them explicitly javascript var text this string contains double quotes which are escaped javascript let text this string contains double quotes which don t need to be escaped anymore template literals also support interpolation which makes the task of concatenating strings and values javascript var name tiger var age  console log my cat is named and name and and is and age and years old much simpler javascript const name tiger const age  console log my cat is named name and is age years old in es we handled new lines as follows javascript var text cat n and dog n and nickelodeon javascript var text cat  dog  nickelodeon join n template literals will preserve new lines for us without having to explicitly place them in javascript let text cat nickelodeon template literals can accept expressions as well javascript let today new date let text the time and date is today tolocalestring sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays and objects even deeply nested and store them in variables with a more convenient syntax javascript var arr     var a arr  var b arr  var c arr  var d arr  javascript let a b c d     console log a and and  console log b and and  javascript var luke occupation jedi  father anakin var occupation luke occupation and and jedi var father luke father and and anakin javascript let luke occupation jedi  father anakin let occupation father luke console log occupation and and jedi console log father and and anakin sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup in node js with es we can now directly use modules of all types amd and commonjs javascript module exports  module exports foo bar module exports foo  bar module exports function bar with es we have various flavors of exporting we can perform named exports javascript export let name david export let age    as well as exporting a list of objects javascript function sumtwo a b return a and b function sumthree a b c return a and b and c export sumtwo sumthree we can also export functions objects and values etc simply by using the export keyword javascript export function sumtwo a b return a and b export function sumthree a b c return a and b and c and lastly we can export default bindings javascript function sumtwo a b return a and b function sumthree a b c return a and b and c let api sumtwo sumthree export default api and which is the same as export api as default best practices always use the export default method at the end of the module it makes it clear what is being exported and saves time by having to figure out what name a value was exported as more so the common practice in commonjs modules is to export a single value or object by sticking to this paradigm we make our code easily readable and allow ourselves to interpolate between commonjs and es modules es provides us with various flavors of importing we can import an entire file javascript import underscore it is important to note that simply importing an entire file will execute all code at the top level of that file similar to python we have named imports javascript import sumtwo sumthree from math and addition we can also rename the named imports javascript sumtwo as addtwonumbers sumthree as sumthreenumbers from math and addition in addition we can import all the things also called namespace import javascript import as util from math and addition lastly we can import a list of values from a module javascript import as additionutil from math and addition const sumtwo sumthree additionutil importing from the default binding like this javascript import api from math and addition and and same as import default as api from math and addition while it is better to keep the exports simple but we can sometimes mix default import and mixed import if needed when we are exporting like this javascript and and foos js export foo as default foo foo we can import them like the following javascript import foo foo foo from foos when importing a module exported using commonjs syntax such as react we can do javascript import react from react const component proptypes react this can also be simplified further using javascript import react component proptypes from react note values that are exported are bindings  not references therefore changing the binding of a variable in one module will affect the value within the exported module avoid changing the public interface of these exported values sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup in es we had varying ways to handle functions which needed default values  indefinite arguments  and named parameters with es we can accomplish all of this and more using more concise syntax javascript function addtwonumbers x y x x and and  y y and and  return x and y in es we can simply supply default values for parameters in a function javascript function addtwonumbers x  y  return x and y javascript addtwonumbers   and and  addtwonumbers  and and  addtwonumbers and and  in es we handled an indefinite number of arguments like so javascript function logarguments for var i  i arguments length i and and console log arguments i using the rest operator we can pass in an indefinite amount of arguments javascript function logarguments args for let arg of args console log arg one of the patterns in es to handle named parameters was to use the options object pattern adopted from jquery javascript function initializecanvas options var height options height and and  var width options width and and  var linestroke options linestroke and and black we can achieve the same functionality using destructuring as a formal parameter to a function javascript function initializecanvas height  width  linestroke black and and use variables height width linestroke here if we want to make the entire value optional we can do so by destructuring an empty object javascript function initializecanvas height  width  linestroke black and and in es we could find the max of values in an array by using the apply method on math max like this javascript math max apply null     and and  in es we can now use the spread operator to pass an array of values to be used as parameters to a function javascript math max     and and  we can concat array literals easily with this intuitive syntax javascript let cities san francisco  los angeles let places miami  cities chicago and and miami  san francisco  los angeles  chicago sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup prior to es we implemented classes by creating a constructor function and adding properties by extending the prototype javascript function person name age gender this name name this age age this gender gender person prototype incrementage function return this age and  and created extended classes by the following javascript function personal name age gender occupation hobby person call this name age gender this occupation occupation this hobby hobby personal prototype object create person prototype personal prototype constructor personal personal prototype incrementage function person prototype incrementage call this this age and  console log this age es provides much needed syntactic sugar for doing this under the hood we can create classes directly javascript class person constructor name age gender this name name this age age this gender gender incrementage this age and  and extend them using the extends keyword javascript class personal extends person constructor name age gender occupation hobby super name age gender this occupation occupation this hobby hobby incrementage super incrementage this age and  console log this age best practice while the syntax for creating classes in es obscures how implementation and prototypes work under the hood it is a good feature for beginners and allows us to write cleaner code sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup symbols have existed prior to es but now we have a public interface to using them directly symbols are immutable and unique and can be used as keys in any hash calling symbol or symbol description will create a unique symbol that cannot be looked up globally a use case for symbol is to patch objects or namespaces from third parties with your own logic but be confident that you won t collide with updates to that library for example if you wanted to add a method refreshcomponent to the react component class and be certain that you didn t trample a method they add in a later update javascript const refreshcomponent symbol react component prototype refreshcomponent and and do something symbol for key will create a symbol that is still immutable and unique but can be looked up globally two identical calls to symbol for key will return the same symbol instance note this is not true for symbol description javascript symbol foo symbol foo and and false symbol for foo symbol foo and and false symbol for foo symbol for foo and and true a common use case for symbols and in particular with symbol for key is for interoperability this can be achieved by having your code look for a symbol member on object arguments from third parties that contain some known interface for example javascript function reader obj const specialread symbol for specialread if obj specialread const reader obj specialread and and do something with reader else throw new typeerror object cannot be read and then in another library javascript const specialread symbol for specialread class somereadabletype specialread const reader createsomereaderfrom this return reader a notable example of symbol use for interoperability is symbol iterator which exists on all iterable types in es arrays strings generators etc when called as a method it returns an object with an iterator interface sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup maps is a much needed data structure in javascript prior to es we created hash maps through objects javascript var map new object map key value map key value however this does not protect us from accidentally overriding functions with specific property names javascript getownproperty hasownproperty hah overwritten  pwned typeerror property hasownproperty is not a function actual maps allow us to set  get and search for values and much more javascript let map new map map set name  david map get name and and david map has name and and true the most amazing part of maps is that we are no longer limited to just using strings we can now use any type as a key and it will not be type cast to a string javascript let map new map name  david  true false   one   object  function  function for let key of map keys console log typeof key and and string boolean number object function note using non primitive values such as functions or objects won t work when testing equality using methods such as map get as such stick to primitive values such as strings booleans and numbers we can also iterate over maps using entries javascript for let key value of map entries console log key value sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup in order to store private data versions es we had various ways of doing this one such method was using naming conventions javascript class person constructor age this age age incrementage this age and  but naming conventions can cause confusion in a codebase and are not always going to be upheld instead we can use weakmaps to store our values javascript let age new weakmap class person constructor age age set this age incrementage let age age get this and  age set this age if age  console log midlife crisis  the cool thing about using weakmaps to store our private data is that their keys do not give away the property names which can be seen by using reflect ownkeys javascript const person new person  person incrementage and and midlife crisis reflect ownkeys person and and a more practical example of using weakmaps is to store data which is associated to a dom element without having to pollute the dom itself javascript let map new weakmap let el document getelementbyid someelement and and store a weak reference to the element with a key map set el reference and and access the value of the element let value map get el and and reference and and remove the reference el parentnode removechild el el null and and map is empty since the element is destroyed as shown above once the object is destroyed by the garbage collector the weakmap will automatically remove the key value pair which was identified by that object note to further illustrate the usefulness of this example consider how jquery stores a cache of objects corresponding to dom elements which have references using weakmaps jquery can automatically free up any memory that was associated with a particular dom element once it has been removed from the document in general weakmaps are very useful for any library that wraps dom elements sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup promises allow us to turn our horizontal code callback hell javascript func function value func value function value func value function value func value function value func value function value and and do something with value     into vertical code javascript func value then func then func then func then func value and and do something with value  javascript new promise resolve reject reject new error failed to fulfill promise catch reason console log reason where we have two handlers resolve a function called when the promise is fulfilled and reject a function called when the promise is rejected benefits of promises error handling using a bunch of nested callbacks can get chaotic using promises we have a clear path to bubbling errors up and handling them appropriately moreover the value of a promise after it has been resolved and rejected is immutable it will never change here is a practical example of using promises javascript var request require request return new promise resolve reject request get url error response body if body resolve json parse body else resolve we can also parallelize promises to handle an array of asynchronous operations by using promise all javascript let urls and api and commits  and api and issues and opened  and api and issues and assigned  and api and issues and completed  and api and issues and comments  and api and pullrequests let promises urls map url return new promise resolve reject ajax url url done data resolve data  promise all promises then results and and do something with results of all our promises sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup asynchronous code a synchronous feel generators are essentially functions which we can and subsequently return the value of an expression a simple example of using generators is shown below javascript function sillygenerator yield  yield  yield  yield  var generator sillygenerator console log generator next and and value  done false console log generator next and and value  done false console log generator next and and value  done false console log generator next and and value  done false will allow us to push our generator forward and evaluate a new expression while the above example is extremely contrived we can utilize generators to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner javascript and and hiding asynchronousity with generators function request url getjson url function response generator next response and here we write a generator function that will return our data javascript function getdata var data json parse entry var data json parse entry by the power of yield  we are guaranteed that entry will have the data needed to be parsed and stored in data while generators allow us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner there is no clear and easy path for error propagation as such as we can augment our generator with promises javascript function request url return new promise resolve reject getjson url resolve and we write a function which will step through our generator using next which in turn will utilize our request method above to yield a promise javascript function iterategenerator gen var generator gen function iterate val var ret generator next if ret done ret value then iterate   by augmenting our generator with promises we have a clear way of propagating errors through the use of our promise catch and reject to use our newly augmented generator it is as simple as before javascript iterategenerator function getdata var data json parse entry var data json parse entry we were able to reuse our implementation to use our generator as before which shows their power while generators and promises allow us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner while retaining the ability to propagate errors in a nice way we can actually begin to utilize a simpler construction that provides the same benefits sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup while this is actually an upcoming es feature async await allows us to perform the same thing we accomplished using generators and promises with less effort javascript var request require request function getjson url return new promise function resolve reject request url function error response body resolve body async function main var data await getjson console log data and and not undefined under the hood it performs similarly to generators i highly recommend using them over generators and promises a great resource sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup es has started supporting getter and setter functions within classes using the following example javascript class employee constructor name this name name get name if this name return mr and this name touppercase else return undefined  set name newname if newname this name console log i already have this name else if newname this name newname else return false var emp new employee james bond and and uses the get method in the background if emp name console log emp name and and mr james bond and and uses the setter in the background emp name bond  console log emp name and and mr bond  latest browsers are also supporting getter and setter functions in objects and we can use them for computed properties adding listeners and preprocessing before setting and getting javascript var person firstname james  lastname bond  get fullname console log getting fullname return this firstname and and this lastname set fullname name console log setting fullname var words name tostring split this firstname words  and and this lastname words  and and person fullname and and james bond person fullname bond  person fullname and and bond  sup back to table of contents table of contents and sup the mit license mit copyright c  david leonard permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person

16179237, a javascript dom model dom model supporting element creation element creation  diff computation diff computation and patch operations patch operations for efficient re rendering build status   npm version   coverage status   davis dependency status   manual dom manipulation is messy and keeping track of the previous dom state is hard a solution to this problem is to write your code as if you were recreating the entire dom whenever state changes of course if you actually recreated the entire dom every time your application state changed your app would be very slow and your input fields would lose focus virtual dom is a collection of modules designed to provide a declarative way of representing the dom for your app so instead of updating the dom when your application state changes you simply create a virtual tree or vtree  which looks like the dom state that you want virtual dom will then figure out how to make the dom look like this efficiently without recreating all of the dom nodes virtual dom allows you to update a view whenever state changes by creating a full vtree of the view and then patching the dom efficiently to look exactly as you described it this results in keeping manual dom manipulation and previous state tracking out of your application code promoting clean and maintainable rendering logic for web applications javascript var h require virtual dom and h var diff require virtual dom and diff var patch require virtual dom and patch var createelement require virtual dom and create element and and  create a function that declares what the dom should look like function render count return h div  style textalign center  lineheight  and count and px  border px solid red  width  and count and px  height  and count and px   string count and and  initialise the document var count  and and we need some app data here we just store a count var tree render count and and we need an initial tree var rootnode createelement tree and and create an initial root dom node document body appendchild rootnode and and and it should be in the document and and  wire up the update logic setinterval function count and and var newtree render count var patches diff tree newtree rootnode patch rootnode patches tree newtree   you can find the documentation for the seperate components in their readmes for create element js see the vdom readme vdom and readme md for diff js see the vtree readme vtree and readme md for h js see the virtual hyperscript readme virtual hyperscript and readme md for patch js see the vdom readme vdom and readme md for information about the type signatures of these modules feel free to read the javascript signature definition docs jsig virtual dom exposes a set of objects designed for representing dom nodes a document object model model might seem like a strange term but it is exactly that it s a native javascript tree structure that represents a native dom node tree we call this a vtree we can create a vtree using the objects directly in a verbose manner or we can use the more terse virtual hyperscript javascript var vnode require virtual dom and vnode and vnode var vtext require virtual dom and vnode and vtext function render data return new vnode div  classname greeting new vtext hello and string data name module exports render javascript var h require virtual dom and h function render data return h greeting  hello and data name module exports render the dom model is designed to be efficient to create and read from the reason why we don t just create a real dom tree is that creating dom nodes and reading the node properties is an expensive operation which is what we are trying to avoid reading some dom node properties even causes side effects so recreating the entire dom structure with real dom nodes simply isn t suitable for high performance rendering and it is not easy to reason about either a vtree is designed to be equivalent to an immutable data structure while it s not actually immutable you can reuse the nodes in multiple places and the functions we have exposed that take vtrees as arguments never mutate the trees we could freeze the objects in the model but don t for efficiency the benefits of an immutable equivalent data structure will be documented in vtree or blog post at some point haskell createelement tree vtree domnode given that we have created a vtree  we need some way to translate this into a real dom tree of some sort this is provided by create element js when rendering for the first time we would pass a complete vtree to create element function to create the equivalent dom node haskell diff previous vtree current vtree patchobject the primary motivation behind virtual dom is to allow us to write code independent of previous state so when our application state changes we will generate a new vtree the diff function creates a set of dom patches that based on the difference between the previous vtree and the current vtree  will update the previous dom tree to match the new vtree haskell patch rootnode domnode patches patchobject domnode newrootnode once we have computed the set of patches required to apply to the dom we need a function that can apply those patches this is provided by the patch function given a dom root node and a set of dom patches the patch function will update the dom after applying the patches to the dom the dom should look like the new vtree
15345331, bolt is a pure go key and value store inspired by howard chu s hycsymas lmdb project lmdb the goal of the project is to provide a simple fast and reliable database for projects that don t require a full database server such as postgres or mysql since bolt is meant to be used as such a low level piece of functionality simplicity is key the api will be small and only focus on getting values and setting values that s it bolt is stable the api is fixed and the file format is fixed full unit test coverage and randomized black box testing are used to ensure database consistency and thread safety bolt is currently used in high load production environments serving databases as large as tb many companies such as shopify and heroku use bolt backed services every day the original goal of bolt was to provide a simple pure go key and value store and to not bloat the code with extraneous features to that end the project has been a success however this limited scope also means that the project is complete maintaining an open source database requires an immense amount of time and energy changes to the code can have unintended and sometimes catastrophic effects so even simple changes require hours and hours of careful testing and validation unfortunately i no longer have the time or energy to continue this work bolt is in a stable state and has years of successful production use as such i feel that leaving it in its current state is the most prudent course of action if you are interested in using a more featureful version of bolt i suggest that to start using bolt install go and run go get go get github com and boltdb and bolt and this will retrieve the library and install the bolt command line utility into your gobin path the top level object in bolt is a db it is represented as a single file on your disk and represents a consistent snapshot of your data to open your database simply use the bolt open function package main github com and boltdb and bolt func main and and open the my db data file in your current directory and and it will be created if it doesn t exist db err bolt open my db   nil if err nil log fatal err defer db close please note that bolt obtains a file lock on the data file so multiple processes cannot open the same database at the same time opening an already open bolt database will cause it to hang until the other process closes it to prevent an indefinite wait you can pass a timeout option to the open function db err bolt open my db   bolt options timeout  time second bolt allows only one read write transaction at a time but allows as many read only transactions as you want at a time each transaction has a consistent view of the data as it existed when the transaction started individual transactions and all objects created from them e g buckets keys are not thread safe to work with data in multiple goroutines you must start a transaction for each one or use locking to ensure only one goroutine accesses a transaction at a time creating transaction from the db is thread safe read only transactions and read write transactions should not depend on one another and generally shouldn t be opened simultaneously in the same goroutine this can cause a deadlock as the read write transaction needs to periodically re map the data file but it cannot do so while a read only transaction is open to start a read write transaction you can use the db update function err db update func tx bolt tx error return nil inside the closure you have a consistent view of the database you commit the transaction by returning nil at the end you can also rollback the transaction at any point by returning an error all database operations are allowed inside a read write transaction always check the return error as it will report any disk failures that can cause your transaction to not complete if you return an error within your closure it will be passed through to start a read only transaction you can use the db view function err db view func tx bolt tx error return nil you also get a consistent view of the database within this closure however no mutating operations are allowed within a read only transaction you can only retrieve buckets retrieve values and copy the database within a read only transaction each db update waits for disk to commit the writes this overhead can be minimized by combining multiple updates with the db batch function err db batch func tx bolt tx error return nil concurrent batch calls are opportunistically combined into larger transactions batch is only useful when there are multiple goroutines calling it the trade off is that batch can call the given function multiple times if parts of the transaction fail the function must be idempotent and side effects must take effect only after a successful return from db batch for example don t display messages from inside the function instead set variables in the enclosing scope var id uint err db batch func tx bolt tx error and and find last key in bucket decode as bigendian uint increment and and by one encode back to byte and add new key id newvalue return nil if err nil return fmt println allocated id d  id the db view and db update functions are wrappers around the db begin function these helper functions will start the transaction execute a function and then safely close your transaction if an error is returned this is the recommended way to use bolt transactions however sometimes you may want to manually start and end your transactions you can use the db begin function directly but please be sure to close the transaction and and start a writable transaction tx err db begin true if err nil return err defer tx rollback and and use the transaction  err tx createbucket byte mybucket if err nil return err and and commit the transaction and check for error if err tx commit err nil return err the first argument to db begin is a boolean stating if the transaction should be writable buckets are collections of key and value pairs within the database all keys in a bucket must be unique you can create a bucket using the db createbucket function db update func tx bolt tx error b err tx createbucket byte mybucket if err nil return fmt errorf create bucket s  err return nil you can also create a bucket only if it doesn t exist by using the tx createbucketifnotexists function it s a common pattern to call this function for all your top level buckets after you open your database so you can guarantee that they exist for future transactions to delete a bucket simply call the tx deletebucket function to save a key and value pair to a bucket use the bucket put function db update func tx bolt tx error b tx bucket byte mybucket err b put byte answer  byte  return err this will set the value of the answer key to  in the mybucket bucket to retrieve this value we can use the bucket get function db view func tx bolt tx error b tx bucket byte mybucket v b get byte answer fmt printf the answer is s n  v return nil the get function does not return an error because its operation is guaranteed to work unless there is some kind of system failure if the key exists then it will return its byte slice value if it doesn t exist then it will return nil it s important to note that you can have a zero length value set to a key which is different than the key not existing use the bucket delete function to delete a key from the bucket please note that values returned from get are only valid while the transaction is open if you need to use a value outside of the transaction then you must use copy to copy it to another byte slice by using the nextsequence function you can let bolt determine a sequence which can be used as the unique identifier for your key and value pairs see the example below and and createuser saves u to the store the new user id is set on u once the data is persisted func s store createuser u user error return s db update func tx bolt tx error and and retrieve the users bucket and and this should be created when the db is first opened b tx bucket byte users and and generate id for the user and and this returns an error only if the tx is closed or not writeable and and that can t happen in an update call so i ignore the error check id  b nextsequence u id int id and and marshal user data into bytes buf err json marshal u if err nil return err  and and persist bytes to users bucket return b put itob u id  buf and and itob returns an  byte big endian representation of v func itob v int byte b make byte  binary bigendian putuint b uint v return b type user struct id int bolt stores its keys in byte sorted order within a bucket this makes sequential iteration over these keys extremely fast to iterate over keys we ll use a cursor db view func tx bolt tx error and and assume bucket exists and has keys b tx bucket byte mybucket c b cursor for k v c first k nil k v c next fmt printf key s value s n  k v return nil the cursor allows you to move to a specific point in the list of keys and move forward or backward through the keys one at a time the following functions are available on the cursor first move to the first key last move to the last key seek move to a specific key next move to the next key prev move to the previous key each of those functions has a return signature of key byte value byte when you have iterated to the end of the cursor then next will return a nil key you must seek to a position using first  last  or seek before calling next or prev if you do not seek to a position then these functions will return a nil key during iteration if the key is non nil but the value is nil  that means the key refers to a bucket rather than a value use bucket bucket to access the sub bucket to iterate over a key prefix you can combine seek and bytes hasprefix db view func tx bolt tx error and and assume bucket exists and has keys c tx bucket byte mybucket cursor prefix byte  for k v c seek prefix k nil bytes hasprefix k prefix k v c next fmt printf key s value s n  k v return nil another common use case is scanning over a range such as a time range if you use a sortable time encoding such as rfc then you can query a specific date range like this db view func tx bolt tx error and and assume our events bucket exists and has rfc encoded time keys c tx bucket byte events cursor and and our time range spans the  s decade min byte   t  z max byte   t  z and and iterate over the  s for k v c seek min k nil bytes compare k max  k v c next fmt printf s s n  k v return nil note that while rfc is sortable the golang implementation of rfcnano does not use a fixed number of digits after the decimal point and is therefore not sortable you can also use the function foreach if you know you ll be iterating over all the keys in a bucket db view func tx bolt tx error and and assume bucket exists and has keys b tx bucket byte mybucket b foreach func k v byte error fmt printf key s value s n  k v return nil return nil please note that keys and values in foreach are only valid while the transaction is open if you need to use a key or value outside of the transaction you must use copy to copy it to another byte you can also store a bucket in a key to create nested buckets the api is the same as the bucket management api on the db object func bucket createbucket key byte bucket error func bucket createbucketifnotexists key byte bucket error func bucket deletebucket key byte error say you had a multi tenant application where the root level bucket was the account bucket inside of this bucket was a sequence of accounts which themselves are buckets and inside the sequence bucket you could have many buckets pertaining to the account itself users notes etc isolating the information into logical groupings and and createuser creates a new user in the given account func createuser accountid int u user error and and start the transaction tx err db begin true if err nil return err defer tx rollback and and retrieve the root bucket for the account and and assume this has already been created when the account was set up root tx bucket byte strconv formatuint accountid  and and setup the users bucket bkt err root createbucketifnotexists byte users if err nil return err and and generate an id for the new user userid err bkt nextsequence if err nil return err u id userid and and marshal and save the encoded user if buf err json marshal u err nil return err else if err bkt put byte strconv formatuint u id   buf err nil return err and and commit the transaction if err tx commit err nil return err return nil bolt is a single file so it s easy to backup you can use the tx writeto function to write a consistent view of the database to a writer if you call this from a read only transaction it will perform a hot backup and not block your other database reads and writes by default it will use a regular file handle which will utilize the operating documentation for information about optimizing for larger than ram datasets one common use case is to backup over http so you can use tools like curl to do database backups func backuphandlefunc w http responsewriter req http request err db view func tx bolt tx error w header set content type  application and octet stream w header set content disposition  attachment filename my db w header set content length  strconv itoa int tx size  err tx writeto w return err if err nil http error w err error  http statusinternalservererror then you can backup using this command automatically if you want to backup to another file you can use the tx copyfile helper function the database keeps a running count of many of the internal operations it performs so you can better understand what s going on by grabbing a snapshot of these stats at two points in time we can see what operations were performed in that time range for example we could start a goroutine to log stats every  seconds go func and and grab the initial stats prev db stats and and wait for s time sleep  time second and and grab the current stats and diff them stats db stats diff stats sub prev and and encode stats to json and print to stderr json newencoder os stderr encode diff and and save stats for the next loop prev stats it s also useful to pipe these stats to a service such as statsd for monitoring or to provide an http endpoint that will perform a fixed length sample sometimes it is useful to create a shared read only bolt database to this set the options readonly flag when opening your database read only mode uses a shared lock to allow multiple processes to read from the database but it will block any processes from opening the database in read write mode db err bolt open my db   bolt options readonly true if err nil log fatal err bolt is able to run on mobile devices by leveraging the binding feature of the contain your database logic and a reference to a bolt db with a initializing constructor that takes

structure data into rows and are only accessible through the use of sql this approach provides flexibility in how you store and query your data but also incurs overhead in parsing and planning sql statements bolt accesses all data by a byte slice key this makes bolt fast to read and write data by key but provides no built in support for joining values together most relational databases with the exception of sqlite are standalone servers that run separately from your application this gives your systems flexibility to connect multiple application servers to a single database server but also adds overhead in serializing and transporting data over the network bolt runs as a library included in your application so all data access has to go through your application s process this brings data closer to your application but limits multi process access to the data leveldb and its derivatives rocksdb hyperleveldb are similar to bolt in that they are libraries bundled into the application however their underlying structure is a log structured merge tree lsm tree an lsm tree optimizes random writes by using a write ahead log and multi tiered sorted files called sstables bolt uses a b and tree internally and only a single file both approaches have trade offs if you require a high random write throughput  w and sec or you need to use spinning disks then leveldb could be a good choice if your application is read heavy or does a lot of range scans then bolt could be a good choice one other important consideration is that leveldb does not have transactions it supports batch writing of key and values pairs and it supports read snapshots but it will not give you the ability to do a compare and swap operation safely bolt supports fully serializable acid transactions bolt was originally a port of lmdb so it is architecturally similar both use a b and tree have acid semantics with fully serializable transactions and support lock free mvcc using a single writer and multiple readers the two projects have somewhat diverged lmdb heavily focuses on raw performance while bolt has focused on simplicity and ease of use for example lmdb allows several unsafe actions such as direct writes for the sake of performance bolt opts to disallow actions which can leave the database in a corrupted state the only exception to this in bolt is db nosync there are also a few differences in api lmdb requires a maximum mmap size when opening an mdbenv whereas bolt will handle incremental mmap resizing automatically lmdb overloads the getter and setter functions with multiple flags whereas bolt splits these specialized cases into their own functions it s important to pick the right tool for the job and bolt is no exception here are a few things to note when evaluating and using bolt bolt is good for read intensive workloads sequential write performance is also fast but random writes can be slow you can use db batch or add a write ahead log to help mitigate this issue bolt uses a b and tree internally so there can be a lot of random page access ssds provide a significant performance boost over spinning disks try to avoid long running read transactions bolt uses copy on write so old pages cannot be reclaimed while an old transaction is using them byte slices returned from bolt are only valid during a transaction once the transaction has been committed or rolled back then the memory they point to can be reused by a new page or can be unmapped from virtual memory and you ll see an unexpected fault address panic when accessing it bolt uses an exclusive write lock on the database file so it cannot be shared by multiple processes be careful when using bucket fillpercent setting a high fill percent for buckets that have random inserts will cause your database to have very poor page utilization use larger buckets in general smaller buckets causes poor page utilization once they become larger than the page size typically kb bulk loading a lot of random writes into a new bucket can be slow as the page will not split until the transaction is committed randomly inserting more than  key and value pairs into a single new bucket in a single transaction is not advised bolt uses a memory mapped file so the underlying operating system handles the caching of the data typically the os will cache as much of the file as it can in memory and will release memory as needed to other processes this means that bolt can show very high memory usage when working with large databases however this is expected and the os will release memory as needed bolt can handle databases much larger than the available physical ram provided its memory map fits in the process virtual address space it may be problematic on  bits systems the data structures in the bolt database are memory mapped so the data file will be endian specific this means that you cannot copy a bolt file from a little endian machine to a big endian machine and have it work for most users this is not a concern since most modern cpus are little endian because of the way pages are laid out on disk bolt cannot truncate data files and return free pages back to the disk instead bolt maintains a free list of unused pages within its data file these free pages can be reused by later transactions this works well for many use cases as databases generally tend to grow however it s important to note that deleting large chunks of data will not allow you to reclaim that space on disk for more information on page allocation see this comment page allocation bolt is a relatively small code base kloc for an embedded serializable transactional key and value database so it can be a good starting point for people interested in how databases work the best places to start are the main entry points into bolt open initializes the reference to the database it s responsible for creating the database if it doesn t exist obtaining an exclusive lock on the file reading the meta pages memory mapping the file db begin starts a read only or read write transaction depending on the value of the writable argument this requires briefly obtaining the meta lock to keep track of open transactions only one read write transaction can exist at a time so the rwlock is acquired during the life of a read write transaction bucket put writes a key and value pair into a bucket after validating the arguments a cursor is used to traverse the b and tree to the page and position where they key value will be written once the position is found the bucket materializes the underlying page and the page s parent pages into memory as nodes these nodes are where mutations occur during read write transactions these changes get flushed to disk during commit bucket get retrieves a key and value pair from a bucket this uses a cursor to move to the page position of a key and value pair during a read only transaction the key and value data is returned as a direct reference to the underlying mmap file so there s no allocation overhead for read write transactions this data may reference the mmap file or one of the in memory node values cursor this object is simply for traversing the b and tree of on disk pages or in memory nodes it can seek to a specific key move to the first or last value or it can move forward or backward the cursor handles the movement up and down the b and tree transparently to the end user tx commit converts the in memory dirty nodes and the list of free pages into pages to be written to disk writing to disk then occurs in two phases first the dirty pages are written to disk and an fsync occurs second a new meta page with an incremented transaction id is written and another fsync occurs this two phase write ensures that partially written data pages are ignored in the event of a crash since the meta page pointing to them is never written partially written meta pages are invalidated because they are written with a checksum if you have additional notes that could be helpful for others please submit them via pull request below is a list of public open source projects that use bolt backed by boltdb simple tx and

38003903, you are welcome to use this project if it is a better fit for your needs but if you are brand new to the ecosystem i highly recommend checking out something that has received more recent updates thank you to everyone who made this project possible over the past year s this starter kit is designed to get you up and running with a bunch of awesome front end technologies the primary goal of this project is to provide a stable foundation upon which to build modern web appliications its purpose is not to dictate your project structure or to demonstrate a complete real world application but to provide a set of tools intended to make front end development robust easy and most importantly fun check out the full feature list below finally this project wouldn t be possible without the help of our many contributors what you see today is the product of hundreds changes made to keep up with an ever evolving ecosystem thank you thank you for all of your help  requirements requirements

your environment meets the above requirements requirements  you can create a new project based on react redux starter kit by doing the following cd my project name yarn install project dependencies or npm install after completing the installation installation step you re ready to start the project yarn start start the development server or npm start while developing you will probably rely mostly on yarn start however there are additional scripts at your disposal and yarn script and description and and and and and start and serves your app at localhost  and and build and builds the application to and dist and and test and runs unit tests with karma see testing testing and and test watch and runs test in watch mode to re run tests when changed and    build all build related code    public

trigger the application to re render from the top of the tree global state is preserved i e redux  but any local component state is reset this differs from react hot loader but we ve found that performing a full re render helps avoid subtle bugs caused by rhl patching for sass  any change will update the styles in realtime no additional configuration or reload needed using the chrome extension allows your monitors to run on a separate thread and affords better performance and functionality it comes with several of the most popular monitors is easy to configure filters actions and doesn t require installing any packages in your project however it s easy to bundle these developer tools locally should you choose to do so first grab the packages from npm yarn add dev redux devtools redux devtools log monitor redux devtools dock monitor to add a unit test create a spec js file anywhere inside of and tests karma and webpack will automatically find these files and mocha and chai will be available within your test without the need to import them here are a few important plugins and packages available to you during testing  if you mistype a property name e g expect false to be tru then the expression evaluates to undefined the magical getter on the true is never run and so your test silently passes  by default linters don t understand them and therefore mark them as unused expressions which can be annoying and and this silently passes because the getter on true is never invoked it should be true  expect false to be tru and and evalutes to undefined and and much better our assertion is invalid so it throws rather than implicitly passing it should be true  expect false to be tru and and tru is not defined out of the box this starter kit is deployable by serving the and dist folder generated by yarn build this project does not concern itself with the details of server side rendering or api structure since that demands a more opinionated structure that makes it difficult to extend the starter kit the simplest deployment strategy is a static deployment static deployments this project wouldn t be possible without help from the community so i d like to highlight some of its biggest contributors thank you all for your hard work you ve made my life a lot easier and taught me a lot in the process and to everyone else who has contributed even if

4584417, hi there my name s dayle rees and i m one of the laravel php framework team part of the laravel mentality is that coding should be enjoyable for the developer and not just for the client receiving your hard work for this reason i d like to share with you a number of themes for some popular text editors that will hopefully be pleasing to your eyes and allow you to enjoy the time you spend in front of the screen oh also i m british i m not making a spelling mistake it is colour with the u this package currently supports colour schemes for previews html previews of all schemes instead of spamming this readme file with a thousand screenshots i ve created a page where you can preview all of the schemes in html themes in this package are generated from a custom theme file they must be mapped once for each editor the mapping process varies upon the editor and for that reason some editors are considered very wip don t worry we ll get there scheme type and compatibility and sublime text colour schemes and  sublime text ui themes and  coda and  jetbrains inc phpstorm and  bootstrap variables and  vim and  google pretty print and  html previews and  highlight js and  xcode and  installation of the colour schemes depends greatly upon the type of software that you intend to use them with here are the guides for common editors and libraries atom atom bootstrap bootstrap coda  coda  highlightjs highlightjs intellij intellij sublime text sublime text sublime ui themes sublime ui themes textmate   x textmate x textmate  textmate  vim vim xcode colour schemes xcode colour schemes visual studio code visual studio code otherwise you must first find your sublime text  packages directory you can find this by using the preferences browse packages menu from within sublime text next either create a daylerees themes folder within this directory and copy the contents of the github repository inside or clone the repository using the git software within the packages directory now simply use the color schemes option of your preferences menu to switch between themes enjoy clone the repository and copy the theme files into and library and application support and textmate and themes and cd daylerees themes and sublime mkdir and library and application support and textmate and themes and cp tmtheme and library and application support and textmate and themes and clone the repository and copy the theme files into and library and application support and textmate and managed and bundles and themes tmbundle and themes and cd daylerees themes and sublime cp tmtheme and library and application support and textmate and managed and bundles and themes tmbundle and themes and note that you cannot clone the repository into the themes directory as of this writing textmate  will not recursively scan subdirectories searching for themes also note that you cannot symlink the themes into the themes directory either textmate will hang attempting to process them there are multiple methods of installing the colour schemes when using vim download or clone the colour schemes repository with git into your vim and colors directory add the following to your vimrc bundle daylerees and colour schemes  rtp vim and whichever installation method you choose simply add the following line to your vimrc colorscheme scheme name here save and re launch vim to use enjoy see the documentation for your editor this varies between each one warning these are work in progress some themes may look strange be sure to raise an issue though the above theme must be installed before enabling my ui themes since it uses its assets you must also install this colour schemes package as per usual once space gray is installed does not need to be active  add the following line to your user configuration file theme themename sublime theme  where themename is the lowercase filename of the theme located in the and sublimeui directory choose whichever theme you like it doesn t need to match the colourscheme for example theme piggy sublime theme  copy the schemes that you choose from the xcode folder to and library and developer and xcode and userdata and fontandcolorthemes now the schemes will be available within the xcode preferences to use the bootstrap colour themes you must be using the less version of bootstrap simply replace the contents of variables less with one of the files within the bootstrap directory to use the highlight js themes simply use the appropriate css file from within the highlightjs directory to install a coda theme enter the preferences for code click the colors tab hit the cog icon and choose import to select a theme from the coda directory to install an atom theme simply copy it from the atom directory to and atom and packages now you can select it from the settings menu enjoy to install an emacs theme just copy it from the emacs directory to and emacs d and and you can then select it using m x load theme or set it as the default heads up it ll ask you whether you really want to load the theme because it involves running lisp code feel free to check everything s safe before you do copy the theme you want from the vscode directory to and vscode and extensions mac and linux or userprofile vscode extensions windows start vscode or reload the window and select the theme in your preferences hyrule

requested by aur lien thieriot tron legacy aur lien thieriot wasn t happy with just one theme here s tron legacy userscape ian landsman requested a light theme i give you userscape if you would like to request a colourscheme an alternate version of an existing scheme or submit your own theme to the collection simply send an issue or a pull request if you would like to buy me a beer for the time i

23082332, we are no longer providing support for slacktextviewcontroller this project satisfied all of our ios messaging needs in the past and we are proud to have contributed it to the open source community today in order to delight our users with a solution that is highly tailored and rapidly iterated upon we have shifted focus to our internal projects unfortunately this renders us lacking the capacity to support our past projects in addition to our newer internal projects this project has been deprecated as a result important notice please update to   to avoid any risk of app rejection a drop in uiviewcontroller subclass with a growing text input view and other useful messaging features meant to be a replacement for uitableviewcontroller uicollectionviewcontroller demo gif screenshots and slacktextviewcontrollerdemo gif this library was historically used in our ios app at its inception the library satisfied our product needs and was flexible enough to be reused by others wanting to build great messaging apps for ios flexible ui built with auto layout customizable provides left and right button and toolbar outlets tap gesture for dismissing the keyboard undo and redo with

iphone ipad uipopovercontroller uitabbarcontroller container view controller auto rotation ipad multitasking ios  only localization pod slacktextviewcontroller github slackhq and slacktextviewcontroller there are two ways to do this copy and drag the source and folder to your project slktextviewcontroller is meant to be subclassed like you would normally do with uitableviewcontroller or uicollectionviewcontroller or uiscrollview this pattern is a convenient way of extending uiviewcontroller slacktextviewcontroller manages a lot behind the scenes while still providing the ability to add custom behaviours you may override methods and decide to call super and perform additional logic or not to call super and override default logic start by creating a new subclass of slktextviewcontroller in the init overriding method if you wish to use the uitableview version call super initwithtableviewstyle uitableviewstyleplain super init tableviewstyle plain or the uicollectionview version super initwithcollectionviewlayout uicollectionviewflowlayout new super init collectionviewlayout uicollectionviewflowlayout or the uiscrollview version super initwithscrollview self mystrongscrollview super init scrollview self mystrongscrollview protocols like uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource are already setup for you you will be able to call whatever delegate and data source methods you need for customising your control calling super init will call super initwithtableviewstyle uitableviewstyleplain by default when using slacktextviewcontroller with storyboards instead of overriding the traditional initwithcoder you will need to override any of the two custom methods below this approach helps preserving the exact same features from the programatic approach but also limits the edition of the nib of your slktextviewcontroller subclass since it doesn t layout subviews from the nib subviews are still initialized and layed out programatically if you wish to use the uitableview version call and uitableviewstyle tableviewstyleforcoder nscoder decoder return uitableviewstyleplain override class func tableviewstyleforcoder decoder nscoder uitableviewstyle return plain or the uicollectionview version and uicollectionviewlayout collectionviewlayoutforcoder nscoder decoder return uicollectionviewflowlayout new override class func collectionviewlayoutforcoder decoder nscoder uicollectionviewlayout return uicollectionviewflowlayout check out the sample project everything is demo d there there are  main examples different targets for testing the programatic and storyboard approaches and a swift example most of the features are implemented for you to quickly start using them feel free to contribute growing screenshots and screenshotauto expanding png the text view expands automatically when a new line is required until it reaches its maxnumberoflines value you may change

use the inverted flag property default is yes and true this will actually invert the entire scrollview object make sure to apply the same transformation to every subview in the case of uitableview the

can register markdown formatting symbols so they can easily be used to wrap a text selection with the help of the native contextual menu aka uimenucontroller this feature doesn t take care of the rendering of the markdown it s sole purpose is to ease the formatting tools to the user optionally you can enable autocompleteformatting so any pending markdown closure symbol can be added

9210604, restangular is an angularjs service that simplifies common get post delete and update requests with a minimum of client code it s a perfect fit for any webapp that consumes data from a restful api back to top table of contents restangular has several features that distinguish it from resource you can use this in routeprovider resolve as restangular returns promises you can return any of the methods in the routeprovider resolve and you ll get the real object injected into your controller if you want it doesn t have all those resource bugs restangular doesn t have problem with trailing slashes additional in the url escaping information expecting only arrays for getting lists etc it supports all http methods it supports etag out of the box you don t have to do anything etags and if none match will be used in all of your requests it supports self linking elements if you receive from the server some item that has a link to itself you can use that to query the server instead of writing the url manually you don t have to create one resource object per request each time you want to do a request you can just do it using the object that was returned by restangular you don t need to create a new object for this you don t have to write or remember any url with resource you need to write the url template in here you don t write any urls you just write the name of the resource you want to fetch and that s it it supports nested restful resources if you have nested restful resources restangular can handle them for you you don t have to know the url the path or anything to do all of the http operations you want restangular lets you create your own methods you can create your own methods to run the operation that you want the sky is the limit you can build your own urls with restangular objects easily restangular lets you create a restangular object for any url you want with a really nice builder let s see a quick and short example of these features javascript and and restangular returns promises restangular all users getlist and and get and users then function users and and returns a list of users scope user users  and and first restangular obj in list id  and and later in the code and and restangular objects are self aware and know how to make their own restful requests scope user getlist cars and and get and users and  and cars and and you can also use your own custom methods on restangular objects scope user sendmessage and and post and users and  and sendmessage and and chain methods together to easily build complex requests scope user one messages   one from   getlist unread and and get and users and  and messages and  and from and  and unread back to top table of contents you can download this by using bower and running bower install restangular using npm and running npm install restangular back to top table of contents restangular depends on angular and lodash or underscore back to top table of contents each time there re more production webapps using restangular if your webapp uses it and it s not in the list please create an issue or submit a pr life is using restangular to build the webapp version of their platform thomson reuters is using restangular for the new webapp they ve built quran com is using restangular for their alpha and beta app and soon to be main site back to top table of contents this is all you need to start using all the basic restangular features javascript and and add restangular as a dependency to your app angular module your app  restangular and and inject restangular into your controller angular module your app controller mainctrl  function scope restangular the restangular service may be injected into any controller or directive note when adding restangular as a dependency it is not capitalized restangular but when injected into your controller it is restangular back to top table of contents there are  ways of creating a main restangular object the first one and most common one is by stating the main route of all requests the second one is by stating the main route and object of all requests javascript and and only stating main route restangular all accounts and and stating main object restangular one accounts   and and gets a list of all of those accounts restangular several accounts     back to top table of contents now that we have our main object let s start playing with it javascript and and first way of creating a restangular object just saying the base url var baseaccounts restangular all accounts and and this will query and accounts and return a promise baseaccounts getlist then function accounts scope allaccounts accounts and and does a get to and accounts and and returns an empty array by default once a value is returned from the server and and that array is filled with those values so you can use this in your template scope accounts restangular all accounts getlist object var newaccount name gonto s account and and post and accounts baseaccounts post newaccount and and you can do requestless connections if you need as well and and just one get to and accounts and  and buildings and  restangular one accounts   one buildings   get and and just one get to and accounts and  and buildings restangular one accounts   getlist buildings and and here we use promises then and and get and accounts baseaccounts getlist then function accounts and and here we can continue fetching the tree var firstaccount accounts  and and this will query and accounts and  and buildings considering  is the id of the firstaccount scope buildings firstaccount getlist buildings and and get and accounts and  and places query param with request header x user mgonto scope loggedinplaces firstaccount getlist places  query param  x user mgonto and and this is a regular js object we can change anything we want firstaccount name gonto and and if we wanted to keep the original as it is we can copy it to a new element var editfirstaccount restangular copy firstaccount editfirstaccount name new name and and put and accounts and  the name of this account will be changed from now on firstaccount put editfirstaccount put and and put and accounts and  save will do post or put accordingly firstaccount save and and delete and accounts and  we don t have first account anymore firstaccount remove var mybuilding name gonto s building  place argentina and and post and accounts and  and buildings with mybuilding information firstaccount post buildings  mybuilding then function console log object saved ok  function console log there was an error saving and and get and accounts and  and users query params firstaccount getlist users  query params then function users and and instead of posting nested element a collection can post to itself and and post and accounts and  and users users post username unknown and and custom methods are available now and and get and accounts and  and users and messages param myparam users customget messages  param myparam var firstuser users  and and get and accounts and  and users and  just in case we want to update one user scope userfromserver firstuser get and and all http methods are available and and head and accounts and  and users and  firstuser head  function errorcallback alert oops error from server and and second way of creating restangular object url and id var account restangular one accounts   and and get and accounts and  single true scope account account get single true and and post and accounts and  and messages param myparam with the body of name my message account custompost name my message  messages  param myparam  back to top table of contents restangular comes with defaults for all of its properties but you can configure them so if you don t need to configure something there s no need to add the configuration you can set all these configurations in restangularprovider or restangular service to change the global configuration or you can use the withconfig method in restangular service to create a new restangular service with some scoped configuration check the section on this later these are the fields that you want to save from your parent resources if you need to display them by default this is an empty array which will suit most cases use this property to control whether restangularized elements to have a parent or not so for example if you get an account and then get a nested list of buildings you may want the buildings url to be simple and buildings and  instead of and accounts and  and buildings and  this property lets you do that this method accepts  parameter it could be boolean specifies if all elements should be parentless or not array specifies the routes types of all elements that should be parentless for example buildings this is a hook after each element has been restangularized added the new methods from restangular  the corresponding transformer will be called if it fits this should be used to add your own methods and functions to entities of certain types you can add as many element transformers as you want the signature of this method can be one of the following addelementtransformer route transformer transformer is called with all elements that have been restangularized no matter if they re collections or not addelementtransformer route iscollection transformer transformer is called with all elements that have been restangularized and match the specification regarding if it s a collection or not true and false this sets whether transformers will be run for local objects and not by objects returned by the server this is by default true but can be changed to false if needed most people won t need this this is a hook after each element has been restangularized added the new methods from restangular  this will be called it means that if you receive a list of objects in one call this method will be called first for the collection and then for each element of the collection i favor the usage of addelementtransformer instead of onelemrestangularized whenever possible as the implementation is much cleaner this callback is a function that has  parameters elem the element that has just been restangularized can be a collection or a single element iscollection boolean indicating if this is a collection or a single element what the model that is being modified this is the path of this resource for example buildings restangular the instanced service to use any of its methods this can be used together with addrestangularmethod explained later to add custom methods to an element this is deprecated use addresponseinterceptor since you can add more than one the responseinterceptor is called after we get each response from the server it s a function that receives this arguments data the data received got from the server operation the operation made it ll be the http method used except for a get which returns a list of element which will return getlist so that you can distinguish them what the model that s being requested it can be for example accounts  buildings  etc url the relative url being requested for example and api and v and accounts and  response full server response including headers deferred the deferred promise for the request some of the use cases of the responseinterceptor are handling wrapped responses and enhancing response elements with more methods among others the responseinterceptor must return the restangularized data element this is deprecated use addrequestinterceptor since you can add more than one the requestinterceptor is called before sending any data to the server it s a function that must return the element to be requested this function receives the following arguments element the element to send to the server operation the operation made it ll be the http method used except for a get which returns a list of element which will return getlist so that you can distinguish them what the model that s being requested it can be for example accounts  buildings  etc url the relative url being requested for example and api and v and accounts and  this is deprecated use addfullrequestinterceptor since you can add more than one this adds a new fullrequestinterceptor the fullrequestinterceptor is similar to the requestinterceptor but more powerful it lets you change the element the request parameters and the headers as well it s a function that receives the same as the requestinterceptor plus the headers and the query parameters in that order it can return an object with any or all of following properties headers the headers to send params the request parameters to send element the element to send httpconfig the httpconfig to call with if a property isn t returned the one sent is used the errorinterceptor is called whenever there s an error it s a function that receives the response the deferred for the promise and the restangular response handler as parameters the errorinterceptor function whenever it returns false  prevents the promise linked to a restangular request to be executed all other return values besides false are ignored and the promise follows the usual path eventually reaching the success or error hooks the feature to prevent the promise to complete is useful whenever you need to intercept each restangular error response for every request in your angularjs application in a single place increasing debugging capabilities and hooking security features in a single place javascript var refreshaccesstoken function var deferred q defer and and refresh access token logic return deferred promise restangular seterrorinterceptor function response deferred responsehandler if response status  refreshaccesstoken then function and and repeat the request and then call the handlers the usual way http response config then responsehandler deferred reject and and be aware that no request interceptors are called this way  return false and and error handled return true and and error not handled restangular requires  fields for every restangularized element these are id id of the element default id route name of the route of this element default route parentresource the reference to the parent resource default parentresource restangularcollection a boolean indicating if this is a collection or an element default restangularcollection cannonicalid if available the path to the cannonical id to use useful for pk changes etag where to save the etag received from the server defaults to restangularetag selflink the path to the property that has the url to this item if your rest api doesn t return a url to an item you can just leave it blank defaults to href also all of restangular methods and functions are configurable through restangularfields property all of these fields except for id and selflink are handled by restangular so most of the time you won t change them you can configure the name of the property that will be binded to all of this fields by setting restangularfields property you can now override http methods you can set here the array of methods to override all those methods will be sent as post and restangular will add an x http method override header with the real http method we wanted to do typical web browsers prohibit requesting data from a server in a different domain same origin policy jsonp or json with padding is a communication technique used in javascript programs running in web browsers to get around this for jsonp to work a server must know how to reply with jsonp formatted results jsonp does not work with json formatted results the jsonp parameters passed as arguments to a script are defined by the server by setting the value of setjsonp to true both get and getlist will be performed using jsonp instead of the regular get javascript restangularprovider setdefaultrequestparams jsonp  callback jsoncallback you can set default query parameters to be sent with every request and every method additionally if you want to configure request params per method you can use requestparams configuration similar to http for example restangularprovider requestparams get single true supported method to configure are remove get post put common all javascript and and set params for multiple methods at once restangular setdefaultrequestparams remove  post  confirm true and and set only for get method restangular setdefaultrequestparams get  limit  and and or for all supported request methods restangular setdefaultrequestparams apikey secret key you can set fullresponse to true to get the whole response every time you do any request the full response has the restangularized data in the data field and also has the headers and config sent by default it s set to false please note that in order for restangular to access custom http headers your server must respond having the access control expose headers set javascript and and set params for multiple methods at once restangular setfullresponse true or set it per service javascript and and restangular service that uses setfullresponse app factory restfulresponse  function restangular return restangular withconfig function restangularconfigurer restangularconfigurer setfullresponse true and and let s use it in the controller app controller mainctrl  function restangular restfulresponse and and uses full response configuration restfulresponse all users getlist then function response scope users response data console log response headers you can set default headers to be sent with every request send format headername headervalue javascript and and set default header token restangularprovider setdefaultheaders token x restangular if all of your requests require to send some suffix to work you can set it here for example if you need to send the format like and users and  json you can add that json to the suffix using the setrequestsuffix method you can set this to either true or false by default it s false if set to true then the cannonical id from the element will be used for url creation in delete put post etc what this means is that if you change the id of the element and then you do a put if you set this to true it ll use the old id which was received from the server if set to false it ll use the new id assigned to the element you can set this to true or false by default it s false if set to true data retrieved will be returned with no embed methods from restangular you can set here if you want to url encode ids or not by default it s true back to top table of contents you can also access the configuration via restangularprovider and restangular via the configuration property if you don t want to use the setters check it out restangular configuration requestsuffix and back to top table of contents you can configure this in either the config or the run method if your configurations don t need any other services then i d recommend you do them in the config if your configurations depend on other services you can configure them in the run using restangular instead of restangularprovider javascript app config function restangularprovider restangularprovider setbaseurl and api and v restangularprovider setextrafields name restangularprovider setresponseextractor function response operation return response data restangularprovider addelementtransformer accounts  false function element element accountname changed return element restangularprovider setdefaulthttpfields cache true restangularprovider setmethodoverriders put  patch and and in this case we are mapping the id of each element to the id field and and we also change the restangular route and and the default value for parentresource remains the same restangularprovider setrestangularfields id id  route restangularroute  selflink self href restangularprovider setrequestsuffix json and and use request interceptor restangularprovider setrequestinterceptor function element operation route url delete element name return element and and or use the full request interceptor setrequestinterceptor s more powerful brother restangularprovider setfullrequestinterceptor function element operation route url headers params httpconfig delete element name return element element params  extend params single true  headers headers httpconfig httpconfig javascript and and here i inject the service baseurlcalculator which i need app run function restangular baseurlcalculator restangular setbaseurl baseurlcalculator calculate back to top table of contents let s assume that for most requests you need some configuration the global one  and for just a bunch of methods you need another configuration in that case you ll need to create another restangular service with this particular configuration this scoped configuration will inherit all defaults from the global one let s see how javascript and and global configuration app config function restangularprovider restangularprovider setrequestsuffix json and and restangular service that uses bing app factory bingrestangular  function restangular return restangular withconfig function restangularconfigurer and and let s use them from a controller app controller mainctrl  function restangular bingrestangular and and uses global configuration restangular all users getlist and and uses bing configuration which is based on global one therefore json is added bingrestangular all users getlist back to top table of contents there re some times where you want to use restangular but you don t want to expose restangular object anywhere for those cases you can actually use the service feature of restangular let s see how it works and and declare factory module factory users  function restangular return restangular service users and and in your controller you inject users users get  and and get to and users and  users one  get and and get to and users and  users post data and and post to and users and and get to and users users getlist then function users var user users  and and user id  name tonto user name gonto and and put to and users and  user put you can also use withhttpconfig on objects created by restangular service var personservice restangular service person var entity personservice withhttpconfig transformrequest function data data fullname data firstname and and data lastname return json stringify data post lastname mueller  firstname gerd then function resp console log resp we can also use nested restful resources with this var cars restangular service cars  restangular one users   cars getlist and and get to and users and  and cars back to top table of contents there are  sets of methods collections have some methods and elements have others there are are also some common methods for all of them these are the methods that can be called on the restangular object one route id this will create a new restangular object that is just a pointer to one element with the route route and the specified id all route this will create a new restangular object that is just a pointer to a list of elements for the specified path oneurl route url this will create a new restangular object that is just a pointer to one element with the specified url allurl route url this creates a restangular object that is just a pointer to a list at the specified url copy fromelement this will create a copy of the from element so that we can modify the copied one restangularizeelement parent element route fromserver collection reqparams restangularizes a new element restangularizecollection parent element route fromserver reqparams restangularizes a new collection back to top table of contents get queryparams headers gets the element query params and headers are optionals getlist subelement queryparams headers gets a nested resource subelement is mandatory it s a string with the name of the nested resource and url for example buildings put queryparams headers does a put to the current element post subelement elementtopost queryparams headers does a post and creates a subelement subelement is mandatory and is the nested resource element to post is the object to post to the server head queryparams headers does a head trace queryparams headers does a trace options queryparams headers does a options patch object queryparams headers does a patch one route id used for requestless connections and url building see section below all route used for requestless connections and url building see section below several route ids used for requestless connections and url building see section below oneurl route url this will create a new restangular object that is just a pointer to one element with the specified url allurl route url this creates a restangular object that is just a pointer to a list at the specified url getrestangularurl gets the url of the current object getrequestedurl gets the real url the current object was requested with incl get parameters will equal getrestangularurl when no parameters were used before calling get  or when using on a nested child getparentlist gets the parent list to which it belongs if any clone copies the element it s an alias to calling restangular copy elem plain returns the plain element received from the server without any of the enhanced methods from restangular it s an alias to calling restangular striprestangular elem withhttpconfig httpconfig it lets you set a configuration for http only for the next call check the local config http section for an example save calling save will determine whether to do put or post accordingly back to top table of contents getlist queryparams headers gets itself again remember this is a collection get id gets one item from the collection by id post elementtopost queryparams headers creates a new element of this collection head queryparams headers does a head trace queryparams headers does a trace options queryparams headers does a options patch object queryparams headers does a patch putelement idx params headers puts the element on the required index and returns a promise of the updated new array getrestangularurl gets the url of the current object getrequestedurl gets the real url the current object was requested with incl get parameters will equal getrestangularurl when no parameters were used before calling getlist  or when using on a nested child one route id used for requestless connections and url building see section below all route used for requestless connections and url building see section below several route ids used for requestless connections and url building see section below oneurl route url this will create a new restangular object that is just a pointer to one element with the specified url allurl route url this creates a restangular object that is just a pointer to a list at the specified url clone copies the collection it s an alias to calling restangular copy collection withhttpconfig httpconfig it lets you set a configuration for http only for the next call check the local config http section for an example back to top table of contents customget path params headers does a get to the specific path optionally you can set params and headers customgetlist path params headers does a get to the specific path in this case you expect to get an array not a single element optionally you can set params and headers customdelete path params headers does a delete to the specific path optionally you can set params and headers custompost elem path params headers does a post to the specific path optionally you can set params and headers and elem elem is the element to post if it s not set it s assumed that it s the element itself from which you re calling this function customput elem path params headers does a put to the specific path optionally you can set params and headers and elem elem is the element to post if it s not set it s assumed that it s the element itself from which you re calling this function custompatch elem path params headers does a patch to the specific path accepts the same arguments as customput customoperation operation path params headers elem this does a custom operation to the path that we specify this method is actually used from all the others in this subsection operation can be one of get post put remove head options patch trace addrestangularmethod name operation path params headers elem this will add a new restangular method to this object with the name name to the operation and path specified or current path otherwise there s a section on how to do this later let s see an example of this javascript and and get and accounts and  and messages restangular one accounts   customget messages and and get and accounts and messages param param restangular all accounts customget messages  param param all custom methods have an alias where you replace custom by do for example customget is equal to doget just pick whatever syntax you prefer back to top table of contents before modifying an object we sometimes want to copy it and then modify the copied object we can t use angular copy for this because it ll not change the this bound in the functions we add to the object in this cases you must use restangular copy fromelement back to top table of contents restangular uses enhanced promises when returning what does this mean all promises returned now have  additional methods and collection promises have  these are the methods call methodname params this will return a new promise of the previous value after calling the method called methodname with the parameters params get fieldname this will return a new promise for the type of the field the param of this new promise is the property fieldname from the original promise result push object this method will only be in the promises of arrays it s a subset of the call method that does a push object this returns the reference to the object that will be filled once the server responds a value this means that if you call getlist this will be an empty array by default once the array is returned from the server this same object property will get filled with results from the server i know these explanations are quite complicated so let s see an example d javascript var buildings restangular all buildings getlist and and new promise after adding the new building and and now you can show in scope this newbuildings promise and it ll show all the buildings and and received from server plus the new one added var newbuildings buildings push name gonto var newbuildingssame buildings call push  name gonto and and this is a promise of a number value you can show it in the ui var lengthpromise buildings get length lengthpromise then function length and and here the length is the real length value of the returned collection of buildings back to top table of contents since angular   promise unwrapping in templates has been disabled by default and will be deprecated soon this means that the following will cease to work scope accounts restangular all accounts getlist as this was a really handy way of working with restangular i ve made a feature similar to resource that will enable this behavior again scope accounts restangular all accounts getlist object the object property is a new property i ve added to promises by default it ll be an empty array or object once the sever has responded with the real value that object or array is filled with the correct response therefore making the ng repeat work pretty neat d back to top table of contents a lot of rest apis return the url to self of the element that you re querying you can use that with restangular so that you don t have to create the urls yourself but use the ones provided by the server let s say that when doing a get to and people you get the following javascript name martin  lastname gontovnikas self name john  lastname wayne self in this case as you can see the url to each element can t be guessed so we need to use that to reference the element restangular supports both relative and absolute urls how do we do this with restangular first we need to configure the path for the link to self for that in the config we do javascript restangularprovider setrestangularfields selflink self link then we can just use this javascript and and instead of using all we could also use allurl to set a url restangular all people getlist then function people var gonto people  gonto name owned and and it uses the self linking property d gonto put back to top table of contents sometimes we have a lot of nested entities and their ids  but we just want the last child in those cases doing a request for everything to get the last child is overkill for those cases i ve added the possibility to create urls using the same api as creating a new restangular object this connections are created without making any requests let s see how to do this javascript var restangularspaces restangular one accounts  one buildings   all spaces and and this will do one get to and accounts and  and buildings and  and spaces restangularspaces getlist and and this will do one get to and accounts and  and buildings and  and spaces and  restangular one accounts   one buildings   one spaces   get and and post and accounts and  and buildings and  and spaces restangular one accounts   one buildings   all spaces post name new space and and delete and accounts and  and buildings and  restangular one accounts   one buildings   remove back to top table of contents there re sometimes when you want to set a specific configuration http configuration just for one restangular s call for that you can use withhttpconfig you must call that method just before doing the http request let s learn how to use it with the following example restangular one accounts   withhttpconfig timeout  getlist buildings scope account withhttpconfig timeout  put back to top table of contents let s assume that your api needs some custom methods to work if that s the case always calling customget or custompost for that method with all parameters is a pain in the ass that s why every element has a addrestangularmethod method this can be used together with the hook addelementtransformer to do some neat stuff let s see an example to learn this javascript and and in your app configuration config method and and it will transform all building elements not collections restangularprovider addelementtransformer buildings  false function building and and this will add a method called evaluate that will do a get to path evaluate with no default and and query params and with some default header and and signature is name operation path params headers elementtopost building addrestangularmethod evaluate  get  evaluate  undefined myheader value return building restangularprovider addelementtransformer users  true function user and and this will add a method called login that will do a post to the path login and and signature is name operation path params headers elementtopost user addrestangularmethod login  post  login return user and and then later in your code you can do the following and and get to and buildings and  and evaluate myparam param with headers myheader value and and signature for this custom created methods is params headers elem if it s a safe operation get options etc and and if it s an unsafe operation post put etc  signature is elem params headers and and if something is set to any of this variables the default set in the method creation will be overridden and and if nothing is set then the defaults are sent restangular one buildings   evaluate myparam param and and get to and buildings and  and evaluate myparam param with headers myheader specialheadercase restangular one buildings   evaluate myparam param  myheader specialheadercase and and here the body of the post is going to be key value as post is an unsafe operation restangular all users login key value back to top table of contents create custom methods for your collection using restangular extendcollection this is an alias for restangular addelementtransformer route true fn and and create methods for your collection restangular extendcollection accounts  function collection collection totalamount function and and implementation here return collection var accountspromise restangular all accounts getlist accountspromise then function accounts accounts totalamount and and invoke your custom collection method back to top table of contents create custom methods for your models using restangular extendmodel this is an alias for restangular addelementtransformer route false fn back to top table of contents restangular extendmodel accounts  function model model prettifyamount function return model var accountpromise restangular one accounts   get accountpromise then function account account prettifyamount and and invoke your custom model method back to top table of contents errors can be checked on the second argument of the then javascript restangular all accounts getlist then function console log all ok  function response console log error with status code  response status you can use defaultheaders property for this or httpprovider defaults headers  whichever suits you better defaultsheaders can be scoped with withconfig so it s really cool http can cache requests if you send the property cache to true you can do that for every restangular request by using defaulthttpfields property this is the way javascript restangularprovider setdefaulthttpfields cache true yes of course every method in restangular returns a promise so this can be used without any problem you must add a requestinterceptor for this restangularprovider setrequestinterceptor function elem operation if operation remove return null return elem so let s assume that your data is the following javascript and and when getting the list this is the response status success  data data id  and and more data meta totalrecord  and and when getting a single element this is the response status success  data id  and and more data in this case you d need to use restangularprovider s addresponseinterceptor see the following javascript app config function restangularprovider and and add a response interceptor restangularprovider addresponseinterceptor function data operation what url response deferred var extracteddata and and to look for getlist operations if operation getlist and and and handle the data and meta data extracteddata data data data extracteddata meta data data meta else extracteddata data data return extracteddata what you need to do is to configure the restangularfields and set the id field to id let s see how javascript restangularprovider setrestangularfields id id in some cases people have different id name for each entity for example they have customerid for customer and equipmentid for equipment if that s the case you can override restangular s getidfromelem for that you need to do restangularprovider configuration getidfromelem function elem and and if route is customers returns customerid return elem  initial elem route join and id with that you d get what you need this can be done using the custompost and customput method look at the following example restangular all users withhttpconfig transformrequest angular identity custompost formdata undefined undefined content type undefined the best option for doing crud operations with a list is to actually use the real list and not the promise it makes it easy to interact with it let s see an example javascript and and here we use then to resolve the promise restangular all users getlist then function users scope users users var userwithid  find users function user return user id  userwithid name gonto userwithid put and and alternatively delete the element from the list when finished userwithid remove then function and and updating the list and removing the user after the response is ok scope users  without scope users userwithid when you actually get a list by doing javascript scope owners house getlist owners object you re actually assigning a promise to the owners value of the scope as angular knows how to process promises if in your view you do an ng repeat of this scope variable results will be shown once the promise is resolved response arrived however changes to that promise that you do from your html won t be seen in the scope as it s not a real array it s just a promise of an array while the example above removes the deleted user from the collection it also overwrites the collection object with a plain array because of  without which no longer knows about its restangular attributes if want to keep the restangularized collection remove the element by modifying the collection in place javascript userwithid remove then function var index scope users indexof userwithid if index  scope users splice index  it won t be stripped out anymore as i ve ditched resource now you can happily put the port in order to get this done you need to use the responseextractor you need to set a property there that will point to the original response received also you need to actually copy this response as that response is the one that s going to be restangularized later javascript restangularprovider setresponseextractor function response var newresponse response if angular isarray response angular foreach newresponse function value key newresponse key originalelement angular copy value else newresponse originalelement angular copy response return newresponse alternatively if you just want the stripped out response on any given call you can use the plain method doing something like this javascript scope showdata function baseurl post somedata then function response console log response plain addendum if you want originalelement to be the original response object instead of having an original value for each key in your newresponse array replace newresponse key originalelement angular copy value newresponse originalelement key angular copy value this is typically caused by cross origin request policy in order to enable cross domain communication and get correct response with appropriate status codes you must have the cors headers attached even in error responses if the server does not attach the cors headers to the response then the xhr object won t parse it thus the xhr object won t have any response body status or any other response data inside which typically will cause your request to fail with status code  this is a very good question i could ve done the code so that i don t depend on underscore nor lodash but i think both libraries make your life so much easier they have all of the functional stuff like map reduce filter find etc with these libraries you always work with immutable stuff you get compatibility for browsers which don t implement ecma nor some of these cool methods and they re actually quicker so why not use it if you ve never heard of them by using restangular you could start using them trust me you re never going to give them up after this back to top table of contents sometimes you may wish to cancel a request this is how you would do it var canceler q defer restangular all users withhttpconfig timeout canceler promise get canceler resolve and and cancels the request this is a little counterintuitive so let me explain restangular is built on top of http  which takes a timeout parameter as per the http docs timeout in milliseconds or promise that should abort the request when resolved resolving the promise canceler in this case  will cancel the request back to top table of contents restangular supports all angular versions from   x   x back to top table of contents users reported that this server frameworks play real nice with restangular as they let you create a nested restful resources api easily ruby on rails cakephp laravel and fatfree

31524768,
45632603, this project is no longer maintained for your redux router syncing needs with react router  and  please see one of these libraries instead   this repo is for react router redux  x which is only compatible with react router  x and  x keep your router in sync with application state sparkles formerly known as redux simple router but the two libraries don t coordinate you want to do time travel with your application state but react router doesn t navigate between pages when you replay actions it controls an important part of application state the url npm install save react router redux this library allows you to use react router s apis as they are documented and you can use redux like you normally would with a single app state the library simply enhances a history instance to allow it to synchronize any changes it receives into application state let s take a look at a simple example import react from react import reactdom from react dom import createstore combinereducers from redux import provider from react redux import router route browserhistory from react router import synchistorywithstore routerreducer from react router redux and and add the reducer to your store on the routing key const store createstore combinereducers reducers routing routerreducer and and create an enhanced history that syncs navigation events with the store const history synchistorywithstore browserhistory store reactdom render provider store store and tell the router to use our enhanced history and router history history route path and component app and route and router and provider  document getelementbyid mount now any time you navigate which can come from pressing browser buttons or navigating in your application code the enhanced history will first pass the new location through the redux store and then on to react router to update the component tree if you time travel it will also pass the new state to react router to update the component tree again simply listen to the enhanced history via history listen this takes in a function that will receive a location any time the store updates this includes any time travel activity performed on the store const history synchistorywithstore browserhistory store history listen location analyticsservice track location pathname for other kinds of events in your system you can use middleware on your redux store like normal to watch any action that is dispatched to the store when using a wrapper for your store s state such as immutable js you will need to change two things from the standard setup  by default the library expects to find the history state at state routing if your wrapper prevents accessing properties directly or you want to put the routing state elsewhere pass a selector function to access the historystate via the selectlocationstate option on synchistorywithstore  provide your own reducer function that will receive actions of type locationchange and return the payload merged into the locationbeforetransitions property of the routing state for example state set routing  locationbeforetransitions action payload these two hooks will allow you to store the state that this library uses in whatever format or wrapper you would like function mapstatetoprops state ownprops return id ownprops params id filter ownprops location query filter you should not read the location state directly from the redux store this is because react router operates asynchronously to handle things such as dynamically loaded components and your component tree may not yet be updated in sync with your redux state you should rely on the props passed by react router as they are only updated after it has processed all asynchronous code react router provides singleton versions of history browserhistory and hashhistory that you can import and use from anywhere in your application however if you prefer redux style actions the library also provides a set of action creators and a middleware to capture them and redirect them to your history instance import createstore combinereducers applymiddleware from redux import routermiddleware push from react router redux and and apply the middleware to the store const middleware routermiddleware browserhistory const store createstore reducers applymiddleware middleware and and dispatch from anywhere like normal store dispatch push and foo examples from the community rarr have an example to add send us a pr  larr you must add this reducer to your store for syncing to work a reducer function that stores location updates from history if you use combinereducers  it should be nested under the routing key creates an enhanced history from the provided history this history changes history listen to pass all location updates through the provided store first this ensures if the store is updated either from a navigation event or from a time travel action such as a replay the listeners of the enhanced history will stay in sync you must provide the enhanced history to your router component this ensures your routes stay in sync with your location and your store at the same time the options object takes in the following optional keys selectlocationstate default state state routing a selector function to obtain the history state from your store useful when not using the provided routerreducer to store history state allows you to use wrappers such as immutable js adjusturlonreplay default true when false  the url will not be kept in sync during time travel this is useful when using persiststate from redux devtools and not wanting to maintain the url state when restoring state you must install routermiddleware for these action creators to work push pushes a new location to history becoming the current location replace replaces the current location in history go moves backwards or forwards a relative number of locations in history goforward moves forward one location equivalent to go  goback moves backwards one location equivalent to go  these action creators are also available in one single object as routeractions  which can be used as a convenience when using redux s bindactioncreators a middleware you can apply to your redux store to capture dispatched actions created by the action creators it will redirect those actions to the provided history instance an action type that you can listen for in your reducers to be notified of route updates fires after any changes to history

8530831, jquery menu aim  menu aim is a jquery plugin for dropdown menus that can differentiate between a user trying hover over a dropdown item vs trying to navigate into a submenu s contents this problem is normally solved using timeouts and delays menu aim tries to solve this by detecting the direction of the user s mouse movement this can make for quicker transitions when navigating up and down the menu the experience is hopefully similar to amazon com and s shop by department dropdown menu menuaim activate noop and and fired on row activation deactivate noop and and fired on row deactivation to receive events when a menu s row has been purposefully de activated the following options can be passed to menuaim all functions execute with the relevant row s html element as the execution context this menuaim and and function to call when a row is purposefully activated use this and and to show a submenu s content for the activated row activate function  and and function to call when a row is deactivated deactivate function  and and function to call when mouse enters a menu row entering a row and and does not mean the row has been activated as the user may be and and mousing over to a submenu enter function  and and function to call when mouse exits a menu row exit function  and and function to call when mouse exits the entire menu if this returns and and true the current row s deactivation event and callback function and and will be fired otherwise if this isn t supplied or it returns and and false the currently activated row will stay activated when the and and mouse leaves the menu entirely exitmenu function  and and selector for identifying which elements in the menu are rows and and that can trigger the above events defaults to li rowselector li  and and you may have some menu rows that aren t submenus and therefore and and shouldn t ever need to activate if so filter submenu rows w and and and this selector defaults to all elements submenuselector  and and direction the submenu opens relative to the main menu this and and controls which direction is forgiving as the user moves their and and cursor from the main menu into the submenu can be one of right  and and left  above  or below defaults to right submenudirection right menu aim assumes that you are using a menu with submenus that expand to the menu s right it will fire events when the user s mouse enters a new dropdown item and when that item is being intentionally hovered over play with the above example full of fun monkey pictures by opening example and example html after downloading the repo   does it support horizontal menus or submenus that open to the left yup check out the submenudirection option above  i work at a big company that requires a version number on this third party code before i can use it do you have a version number sure current version

as such if you create any issues or submit pull requests it s not very likely to be integrated thanks to all that helped make onboard better over the last few years adding the following to your podfile and running pod install should do the trick pod onboard if you don t want to use cocoapods  you can use carthage or grab the files located in the source folder and pull them into your project manually each onboarding experience is comprised of two primary components the background and the content pages the background includes the static background image and video the page control and the skip button the content pages are made up of four pieces an image and icon title body and action button create individual pages by creating instances of onboardingcontentviewcontroller provide a title body image text for an action button and within the action block handle whatever you want to do when the users press the button if you don t want a button you can leave both the button text and action handler nil objective c onboardingcontentviewcontroller firstpage onboardingcontentviewcontroller contentwithtitle page title body page body goes here image uiimage imagenamed icon buttontext text for button action and and do something here when users press the button like ask for location services permissions register for push notifications connect to social media or finish the onboarding process let firstpage onboardingcontentviewcontroller title page title  body page body goes here  image uiimage named icon  buttontext text for button void in and and do something here when users press the button like ask for location services permissions register for push notifications connect to social media or finish the onboarding process then create the onboardingviewcontroller by providing either a background image or a url to a local video file in your project and an array of content view controllers you just created you can then present the view modally and get the onboarding process started

awesome application customization  the iconimageview  titlelabel  bodylabel  and actionbutton properties are exposed for customizing fonts sizing etc  and the spacing between elements on the content pages can be customized as well objective c onboardingvc toppadding  onboardingvc undericonpadding  onboardingvc undertitlepadding  onboardingvc bottompadding  demo screenshots and key png blurring masking and fading  by default the image you use for the background will have a mask applied over it darkening it a bit this is to add a little bit of contrast so the text can more easily be seen this can easily be disabled if your image is already edited or looks fine as is objective c onboardingvc shouldmaskbackground no and and defaults to yes we can also apply a blur to your background image objective c onboardingvc shouldblurbackground yes and and defaults to no apply a fade effect to the icons text and buttons while transitioning between pages contents fade out as you scroll away and the contents for the next page fade in as they scroll in objective c onboardingvc shouldfadetransitions yes and and defaults to no note ensure you do not cause the onboard view controller s view to be loaded prior to setting these properties as these values only take effect when the view controller s viewdidload is called so doing something like setting your onboardingvc view backgroundcolor uicolor whitecolor before setting this values would lead to the setting of these to not take effect you can tweak these settings in a few different combinations to get your desired effect demo screenshots and normal png demo screenshots and dark png demo screenshots and lightblur png demo screenshots and darkblur png auto navigation  if you want to automatically move users to the next page in the onboarding process when they press the action button simply set the movestonextviewcontroller property to yes on any onboardingcontentviewcontroller that isn t the last view controller in the onboarding process coupled with this you can disable the ability to swipe between contents by setting the swipingenabled property on the onboardingviewcontroller to no this allows you to have greater control over the onboarding process if you desire finally if your design lends itself to not having a page control or if it is only one page you can set the hidepagecontrol property to yes and the page control dots will not appear objective c contentvc movestonextviewcontroller yes onboardingvc swipingenabled no onboardingvc hidepagecontrol yes  if you want to allow users to skip the onboarding process enable skipping on the onboarding view controller and set a block to be executed when the skip button is pressed objective c onboardingvc allowskipping yes onboardingvc skiphandler and and dismiss fade out etc  there may be cases in which you want to do something when the content pages are about to appear and when they did appear in this case you can set the viewwillappearblock and viewdidappearblock properties on any or all of the content pages to handle whatever you d like objective c contentvc viewwillappearblock and and do something when the view will appear here contentvc viewdidappearblock and and do something when the view appears here i m not currently supporting landscape at the moment so i would recommend either using this in an application that only supports portrait or wrapping it in a subclassed uinavigationcontroller that only supports portrait community questions comments issues and pull requests welcomed this project is made available under the mit

24650339, the physical web is an effort to extend the superpower of the web the url to everyday physical objects our premise is that you should be able to walk up to any  smart physical object e g a vending machine a poster a toy a bus stop a rental car and interact with it without first downloading an app the user experience of smart objects should be much like links in a web browser just tap and use at its base the physical web is a discovery service a smart object broadcasts relevant urls that any nearby device can receive this simple capability can unlock exciting new ways to interact with the web the url is the fundamental building block of the web giving remarkable flexibility of expression it can be a web page with just a tiny paragraph of info a fully interactive web page a deep link into a native application the number of smart objects is going to explode both in our homes and in public spaces much like the web there is going to be a long tail of interactivity for smart objects but the overhead of installing an app for each one just doesn t scale we need a system that lets you walk up and use a device with just a tap the physical web isn t about replacing native apps it s about allowing interaction for the times when native apps just aren t practical the physical web must be an open standard that everyone can use this can t be a product that is locked down by a single company like many web specifications this is an open source design that is being released early so everyone can experiment and comment on it there is much to discuss and add to this specification different physical web clients android android ios ios node nodejs this is a minimal client meant for building utilities

5741345, os x and ios application and framework to play with the apple push notification service apns installation  brew cask install pusher or download the latest pusher app binary pod nwpusher     github noodlewerk and nwpusher or simply include the source files you need nwpusher has a modular architecture and does not have any external dependencies so use what you like testing push notifications for your ios or mac app can be a pain you might consider setting up your own server or use one of the many push webservices online either way it s a lot of work to get all these systems connected properly when it is all working properly push notifications come in fast  sec and reliably however when nothing comes in it can be very hard to find out why that s why i made pusher it is a mac and iphone app for sending push notifications directly to the apple push notification service no need to set up a server or create an account online you only need the ssl certificate and a device token to start pushing directly from your mac or even from an iphone pusher has detailed error reporting and logs which are very helpful with verifying your setup pusher comes with a small framework for both os x and ios it provides various tools for sending notifications programmatically on os x it can use the keychain to retrieve push certificates and keys pusher can also be used without keychain using a pkcs  file if you want to get a better understanding of how push notifications work then this framework is a good place to start and play around mac os x application for sending push notifications through the apn service takes certificates and keys directly from the keychain fully customizable payload with syntax checking allows setting expiration and priority stores device tokens so you don t have to copy paste them every time handles pkcs  files p automatic configuration for sandbox reports detailed error messages returned by apns reads from feedback service os x and ios framework for sending pushes from your own application modular no dependencies use what you like fully documented source code detailed error handling ios compatible so you can also push directly from your iphone o demo applications for both platforms getting started  before you can start sending push notification payloads there are a few hurdles to take first you ll need to obtain the apple push services ssl certificate of the app you want to send notifications to this certificate is used by pusher to set up the ssl connection through which the payloads will be sent to apple second you ll need the device token of the device you want to send your payload to every device has its own unique token that can only be obtained from within the app it s a bit complicated but in the end it all comes down to just a few clicks on apple s dev center website some gray hairs and a bit of patience let s start with the ssl certificate the goal is to get both the certificate and the private key into your os x keychain if someone else already generated this certificate you ll need to ask for exporting these into a pkcs file if there is no certificate generated yet you can generate the certificate and the private key in the following steps  go to the provisioning portal or certificates identifiers profiles  go to certificates and create a apple push notification service ssl  from here on you will be guided through the certificate generation process keep in mind that you will eventually be downloading a certificate which you will need to install in your keychain together with the private key this should look something like this nb there is development and production certificates which should generally correspond to respectively debug and release versions of your app make sure you get the right one check development sandbox or production  ios or mac  and the bundle identifier the push certificate should be exported to a pkcs file which allows you to share these with fellow developers now you need to obtain a device token which is a  character hex string  bits this should be done from within the ios app you re going to push to add the following lines to the

token on the pasteboard you re ready to send some push notifications let s start by sending a notification using the pusher app for mac os x open the pusher xcode project and run the pushermac target the combo box at the top lists the available ssl certificates in the keychain select the certificate you want to use and paste the device token of the device you re pushing to the text field below shows the json formatted payload text that you re sending read more about this format in the apple documentation under apple push notification service now before you press push  make sure the application you re sending to is in the background  e g by pressing the home button this way you re sure the app is not going to interfere with the message yet press push wait a few seconds and see the notification coming in if things are not working as expected then take a look at the troubleshooting section below the ultimate experience is of course pushing from an iphone to an iphone directly this can be done with the pusher ios app before you run the pushertouch target make sure to include the certificate private key and device token inside the app take the pkcs file that you exported earlier and include it in the pushertouch bundle then go to nwappdelegate m in the touch folder and configure pkcsfilename  pkcspassword  and devicetoken now run the pushertouch target if everything is set up correctly you only need to connect and push then you should receive the testing push message on the device again if things are not working as expected take a look at the troubleshooting section below or post an issue on github pushing from code  pusher can also be used as a framework to send notifications programmatically the included xcode project provides examples for both os x and ios the easiest way to include nwpusher is through cocoapods pod nwpusher     before any notification can be sent you first need to create a connection when this connection is established any number of payloads can be sent note that apple doesn t like it when you create a connection for every push therefore be careful to reuse a connection as much as possible in order to prevent apple from blocking to create a connection directly from a pkcs p file objective c nsurl url nsbundle mainbundle urlforresource pusher p withextension nil nsdata pkcs nsdata datawithcontentsofurl url nserror

project for variations on this approach feedback service  the feedback service is part of the apple push notification service the feedback service is basically a list containing device tokens that became invalid apple recommends that you read from the feedback service once every  hours and no longer send notifications to listed devices note that this can be used to find out who removed your app from their device communication with the feedback service can be done with the nwpushfeedback class first connect using one of the connect methods objective c nsurl url nsbundle mainbundle

read pushing to macos  on macos you obtain a device token for your app by calling the registerforremotenotificationtypes method of the nsapplication object it is recommended that you call this method at launch time as part of your normal startup sequence the first time your app calls this method the app object requests the token from apns after the initial call the app object contacts apns only when the device token changes otherwise it returns the existing token quickly the app object notifies its delegate asynchronously upon the successful or unsuccessful retrieval of the device token you use these delegate callbacks to process the device token or to handle any errors that arose you must implement the following delegate methods to track whether registration was successful use the application didregisterforremotenotificationswithdevicetoken to receive the device token and forward it to your server use the application didfailtoregisterforremotenotificationswitherror to respond to errors note if the device token changes while your app is running the app object calls the appropriate delegate method again to notify you of the change the app delegate calls the registerforremotenotificationtypes method as part of its regular launch time setup passing along the types of interactions that you intend to use upon receiving the device token the application didregisterforremotenotificationswithdevicetoken method forwards it to the app s associated server using a custom method if an error occurs during registration the app temporarily disables any features related to remote notifications those features are re enabled when a valid device token is received objective c void applicationdidfinishlaunching nsnotification notification and and

in the wrong order or data is formatted incorrectly the service will refuse to deliver any notification but generally provides few clues about went wrong and how to fix it in the worst case it simply disconnects without even notifying the client some tips on what to look out for a device token is unique to both the device the developer s certificate and to whether the app was built with a production or development sandbox certificate therefore make sure that the push certificate matches the app s provisioning profile exactly this doesn t mean the tokens are always different device tokens can be the same for different bundle identifiers there are two channels through which apple responds to pushed notifications the notification connection and the feedback connection both operate asynchronously so for example after the second push has been sent we might get a response to the first push saying it has an invalid payload use a new identifier for every notification so these responses can be linked to the right notification if it fails to connect then check are the certificates and keys in order use the openssl commands listed above to inspect the certificate see if there is one push certificate and key present also make sure you re online try ping www apple com is the certificate properly loaded try initializing an identity using nwsectools identitywithpkcsdata data password password error error or nwsectools keychainidentitywithcertificate certificate error error are you using the right identity use nwsectools inspectidentity identity to inspect the identity instance in general nwsectools can be helpful for inspecting certificates identities and the keychain can you connect with the push servers try nwpusher connectwithidentity identity error error or nwpusher connectwithpkcsdata pkcs password password error error pusher connects on port  with hosts gateway push apple com and gateway sandbox push apple com  and on port  with hosts feedback push apple com and feedback sandbox push apple com make sure your firewall is configured to allow these connections if nothing is delivered to the device then check is the device online is it able to receive push notifications from other services try to get pushes from other apps for example a messenger many wireless connections work visibly fine but do not deliver push notifications try to switch to another wifi or cellular network are you pushing to the right device token this token should be returned by the os of the receiving device in the callback application didregisterforremotenotificationswithdevicetoken the push certificate should match the provisioning profile of the app check development or production  ios or mac  and the bundle identifier make sure the receiving app is closed so it cannot interfere with the delivery does the push call succeed isn t there any negative response from the push server or feedback server both pusher pushpayload payload token token identifier rand error error and pusher readfailedidentifier identifier apnerror apnerror error error should return yes  but wait a second between pushing and reading also try to connect to the feedback service to read feedback build with xcode  the source comes with an xcode project file that should take care of building the os x and ios demo applications alternatively you can also build pusher app from the commandline with xcodebuild xcodebuild project nwpusher xcodeproj target pushermac configuration release clean install after a successful build pusher app can be

amplitude defaults to   period to   javascript and and increase elasticity animate elements span  easing out elastic      transform translate px  translate px and default and type and and and  and number and function determines the duration of your animation in milliseconds by passing it a callback you can define a different duration for each element the callback takes the index of each element as its argument and returns a number javascript and and first element fades out in s second element in s etc animate elements span  easing linear  duration index index and   opacity   and default and type and and and  and number and function determines the delay of your animation in milliseconds by passing it a callback you can define a different delay for each element the callback takes the index of each element as its argument and returns a number javascript and and first element fades out after s second element after s etc animate elements span  easing linear  delay index index and   opacity   and default and type and and and false and boolean determines if the animation should repeat and default and type and and and normal and string determines the direction of the animation reverse runs the animation backwards alternate switches direction after each iteration if the animation loops and default and type and and and  and number determines the animation playback rate useful in the authoring process to speed up some parts of a long sequence value above  or slow down a specific animation to observe it value below  and default and type and and and false and boolean forces hardware acceleration during an animation if set to true unless you experience performance issues it s recommended to leave it off as hardware acceleration comes with potentially harmful side effects and default and type and and and null and object and function simulates a motion blur effect takes an object or a function returning an object that specifies the strength of the directional blur on the x and y axes a missing axis defaults to   which disables the blur on that axis javascript animate elements circle  easing out exponential  duration  loop true direction alternate  blur x  y   transform translate   translate  and default and type and and and null and function defines a callback invoked on every frame of the animation the callback takes as its argument the animation progress between

textcontent math round progress  animate plus lets you animate html and svg elements with any property that takes numeric values including hexadecimal colors javascript and and animate the radius and fill color of an svg circle animate elements circle  r    fill f  fc each property you animate needs an array defining the start and end values for convenience you can omit everything but the numbers in the end values javascript and and same as translate px  translate px animate elements span  transform translate px   these arrays can optionally be returned by a callback that takes the index of each element just like with duration duration and delay delay javascript and and first element translates by px second element by px etc animate elements span  transform index translate px  index and   animate returns a promise which resolves once the animation finishes the promise resolves to the object initially passed to animate  making animation chaining straightforward and convenient the getting started getting started section gives you a basic promise example since animate plus relies on native promises you can benefit from all the usual features promises provide such as promise all  promise race  and especially async and await which makes animation timelines easy to set up javascript const play async const options await animate elements span  duration  transform translatey vh   await animate options transform rotate turn   await animate options duration  easing in quintic  transform scale    stops the animations on the elements elements passed as the argument javascript

in milliseconds it differentiates from settimeout by returning a promise and being more accurate consistent and battery friendly the delay delay option relies internally on this method javascript import delay from and animateplus js delay  then time console log time ms elapsed animate plus is provided as a native es module which means you may need to transpile it depending on your browser support policy the library works as is using script type module in the following browsers chrome  safari   firefox  javascript animate elements div  transform translate    animations play a major role in the design of good user interfaces they help connecting actions to consequences make the flow of interactions manifest and greatly improve the polish and perception of a product however animations can be damaging and detrimental to the user experience if they get in the way here are a few best practices to keep your animations effective and enjoyable speed keep your animations fast a quick animation makes a software feel more productive and responsive the optimal duration depends on the effect and animation curve but in most cases you should likely stay under  milliseconds easing the animation curve contributes greatly to a well crafted animation the ease out options are usually a safe bet as animations kick off promptly making them react to user interactions instantaneously performance having no animation is better than animations that stutter when animating html elements aim for using exclusively transform and opacity as these are the only properties browsers can animate cheaply restraint tone down your animations and respect user preferences animations can rapidly feel overwhelming and cause motion sickness so it s important to keep them subtle and to attenuate them even more for users who need reduced motion for example by using matchmedia prefers reduced motion in javascript svg file

editor won t let users enter invalid data this is done by using input masks and intelligently enabling and disabling controls however in some cases it is still possible to enter data that doesn t validate against the schema you can use the validate method to check if the data is valid or not javascript and and validate the editor s current value against the schema var errors editor validate if errors length and and errors is an array of objects each with a path  property  and message parameter and and property is the schema keyword that triggered the validation error e g minlength and and

a different value you can pass it in as a parameter javascript and and validate an arbitrary value against the editor s schema var errors editor validate value to test the change event is fired whenever the editor s value changes javascript editor on change function and and do something editor off change functionreference you can also watch a specific field for changes javascript editor

supported as well json editor supports schema references to external urls and local definitions here s an example showing both type object  properties name title full name  ref and definitions and name location definitions name type string  minlength  local references must point to the definitions object of the root node of the schema so and customkey and name will throw an exception if loading an external url via ajax the url must either be on the same domain or return the correct http cross domain headers if your urls don t meet this requirement you can pass in the references to json editor during initialization see usage section above self referential refs are supported check out examples and recursive html for usage examples the links keyword from the hyper schema specification can be used to add links to related documents json editor will use the mediatype property of the links to determine how best to display them image audio and video links will display the media inline as well as providing a text link here are a couple examples simple text link js and jinja title blog post id  type integer  links rel comments  href and posts and self and comments and  and and optional set css classes for the link class comment link open in modal primary text make link download when clicked js and jinja title document filename  type string  links rel download file  href and documents and self  and and can also set download to a string as per the html spec download true show a video preview using html video js and jinja title video filename  type string  links href and videos and self mp  mediatype video and mp the href property is a template that gets re evaluated every time the value changes the variable self is always available look at the dependencies section below for how to include other fields or use a custom template engine there is no way to specify property ordering in json schema although this may change in v of the spec json editor introduces a new keyword propertyorder for this purpose the default property order if unspecified is  properties with the same order will use normal json key ordering type object  properties prop type string prop type string  propertyorder  prop type string  propertyorder  prop type string  propertyorder  in the above example schema prop does not have an order specified so it will default to  so the final order of properties in the form and in returned json data will be  prop order   prop order   prop order   prop order  the default behavior of json editor is to include all object properties defined with the properties keyword to override this behaviour you can use the keyword defaultproperties to set which ones are included type object  properties name type string  age type integer defaultproperties name now only the name property above will be included by default you can use the object properties button to add the age property back in json editor supports many different formats for schemas of type string they will work with schemas of type integer and number as well but some formats may produce weird results if the enum property is specified format will be ignored json editor uses html input types so some of these may render as basic text input in older browsers datetime datetime local number textarea here is an example that will show a color picker in browsers that support it type object  properties color type string  format color in addition to the standard html input formats json editor can also integrate with several rd party specialized editors these libraries are not included in json editor and you must load them on the page yourself sceditor provides wysiwyg editing of html and bbcode to use it set the format to html or bbcode and set the wysiwyg option to true type string  format html  options wysiwyg true you can configure sceditor by setting configuration options in jsoneditor plugins sceditor here s an example jsoneditor plugins sceditor emoticonsenabled false epiceditor is a simple markdown editor with live preview to use it set the format to markdown type string  format markdown you can configure epiceditor by setting configuration options in jsoneditor plugins epiceditor here s an example jsoneditor plugins epiceditor basepath epiceditor ace editor is a syntax highlighting source code editor you can use it by setting the format to any of the following actionscript batchfile cpp alias for c and and coffee csharp django erlang golang groovy handlebars haskell javascript makefile markdown matlab objectivec pascal python smarty stylus vbscript type string  format yaml you can use the hyper schema keyword media instead of format too if you prefer for formats with a mime type type string  media type text and html you can override the default ace theme by setting the jsoneditor plugins ace theme variable jsoneditor plugins ace theme twilight the default boolean editor is a select box with options true and false to use a checkbox instead set the format to checkbox type boolean  format checkbox the default array editor takes up a lot of screen real estate the table and tabs formats provide more compact uis for editing arrays the table format works great when every array element has the same schema and is not too complex the tabs format can handle any array but only shows one array element at a time it has tabs on the left for switching between items here s an example of the table format type array  format table  items type object  properties name type string for arrays of enumerated strings you can also use the select or checkbox format these formats require a very specific schema to work type array  uniqueitems true items type string  enum value  value by default the checkbox editor multiple checkboxes will be used if there are fewer than  enum options otherwise the select editor a multiselect box will be used you can override this default by passing in a format type array  format select  uniqueitems true items type string  enum value  value the default object layout is one child editor per row the grid format will instead put multiple child editors per row this can make the editor much more compact but at a cost of not guaranteeing child editor order type object  properties name type string format grid editor options  editors can accept options which alter the behavior in some way collapsed if set to true the editor will start collapsed works for objects and arrays disablearrayadd if set to true the add row button will be hidden works for arrays disablearraydelete if set to true all of the delete buttons will be hidden works for arrays disablearraydeleteallrows if set to true just the delete all rows button will be hidden works for arrays disablearraydeletelastrow if set to true just the delete last row buttons will be hidden works for arrays disablearrayreorder if set to true the move up and down buttons will be hidden works for arrays disablecollapse if set to true the collapse button will be hidden works for objects and arrays disableeditjson if set to true the edit json button will be hidden works for objects disableproperties if set to true the edit properties button will be hidden works for objects enumtitles an array of display values to use for select box options in the same order as defined with the enum keyword works with schema using enum values expandheight if set to true the input will auto expand and contract to fit the content works best with textareas gridcolumns explicitly set the number of grid columns   for the editor if it s within an object using a grid layout hidden if set to true the editor will not appear in the ui works for all types inputheight explicitly set the height of the input element should be a valid css width string e g px works best with textareas inputwidth explicitly set the width of the input element should be a valid css width string e g px works for string number and integer data types removeemptyproperties if set to true for an object empty object properties i e those with falsy values will not be returned by getvalue type object  options collapsed true properties name type string you can globally set the default options too if you want jsoneditor defaults editors object options collapsed true dependencies  sometimes it s necessary to have one field s value depend on another s the dependencies keyword from the json schema specification is not nearly flexible enough to handle most use cases so json editor introduces a couple custom keywords that help in this regard the first step is to have a field watch other fields for changes type object  properties firstname type string lastname type string fullname type string  watch fname firstname  lname lastname the keyword watch tells json editor which fields to watch for changes the keys fname and lname in this example are alphanumeric aliases for the fields the values firstname and lastname are paths to the fields to access nested properties of objects use a dot for separation e g path to field by default paths are from the root of the schema but you can make the paths relative to any ancestor node with a schema id defined as well this is especially useful within arrays here s an example type array  items type object  id arritem  properties firstname type string lastname type string fullname type string  watch fname arritem firstname  lname arritem lastname  now the fullname field in each array element will watch the firstname and lastname fields within the same array element watching fields by itself doesn t do anything for the example above you need to tell json editor that fullname should be fname space lname json editor uses a javascript template engine to accomplish this a barebones template engine is included by default simple variable replacement only  but many of the most popular template engines are also supported handlebars markup mustache underscore you can change the default by setting jsoneditor defaults options template to one of the supported template engines javascript jsoneditor defaults options template handlebars you can set the template engine on a per instance basis as well var editor new jsoneditor element schema schema template hogan here is the completed fullname example using the default barebones template engine js and jinja type object  properties firstname type string lastname type string fullname type string  template fname lname  watch fname firstname  lname lastname another common dependency is a drop down menu whose possible values depend on other fields here s an example type object  properties possiblecolors type array  items type string primarycolor type string let s say you want to force primarycolor to be one of colors in the possiblecolors array first we must tell the primarycolor field to watch the possiblecolors array primarycolor type string  watch colors possiblecolors then we use the special keyword enumsource to tell json editor that we want to use this field to populate a drop down primarycolor type string  watch colors possiblecolors enumsource colors now anytime the possiblecolors array changes the dropdown s values will be changed as well this is the most basic usage of enumsource the more verbose form of this property supports filtering pulling from multiple sources constant values etc here s a more complex example this uses the swig template engine syntax to show some advanced features js and jinja and and an array of sources enumsource and and constant values none  and and a watched field source source colors  and and use a subset of the array slice   and and filter items with a template if this renders to an empty string it won t be included filter if item black  endif  and and specify the display text for the enum option title item and upper  and and specify the value property for the enum option value item and trim and and another constant value at the end of the list transparent you can also specify a list of static items with a slightly different syntax js and jinja enumsource and and a watched field source source  value  title one   value  title two  title item title  value item value the colors examples used an array of strings directly using the verbose form you can also make it work with an array of objects here s an example js and jinja type object  properties possiblecolors type array  items type object  properties text type string   primarycolor type string  watch colors possiblecolors enumsource source colors  value item text all of the optional templates in the verbose form have the properties item and i passed into them item refers to the array element i is the zero based index the title keyword of a schema is used to add user friendly headers to the editing ui sometimes though dynamic headers which change based on other fields are helpful consider the example of an array of children without dynamic headers the ui for the array elements would show child   child   etc it would be much nicer if the headers could be dynamic and incorporate information about the children such as  john age    sarah age  to accomplish this use the headertemplate property all of the watched variables are passed into this template along with the static title title e g child  the  based index i e g  and   the  based index i  and the field s value self e g name john  age  js and jinja type array  title children  items type object  title child  headertemplate i self name age self age  properties name type string  age type integer if one of the included template engines isn t sufficient you can use any custom template engine with a compile method for example var myengine compile function template and and compile should return a render function return function vars and and a real template engine would render the template here var result template return result and and set globally jsoneditor defaults options template myengine and and set on a per instance basis var editor new jsoneditor element schema schema template myengine language and string customization  json editor uses a translate function to generate strings in the ui a default en language mapping is provided you can easily override individual translations in the default language or create your own language mapping entirely js and jinja and and override a specific translation jsoneditor defaults languages en errorminlength this better be at least  characters long or else and and create your own language mapping and and any keys not defined here will fall back to the en language jsoneditor defaults languages es errornotset propiedad debe existir by default all instances of json editor will use the en language to override this default set the jsoneditor defaults language property jsoneditor defaults language es custom editor interfaces  json editor contains editor interfaces for each of the primitive json types as well as a few other specialized ones you can add custom editors interfaces fairly easily look at any of the existing ones for an example json editor uses resolver functions to determine which editor interface to use for a particular schema or subschema let s say you make a custom location editor for editing geo data you can add a resolver function to use this custom editor when appropriate for example and and add a resolver function to the beginning of the resolver list and and this will make it run before any other ones jsoneditor defaults resolvers unshift function schema if schema type object schema format location return location and and if no valid editor is returned the next resolver function will be used the following schema will now use this custom editor for each of the array elements instead of the default object editor type array  items type object  format location  properties longitude type number latitude type number if you create a custom editor interface that you think could be helpful to others submit a pull request the possibilities are endless some ideas a compact way to edit objects radio button version of the select editor autosuggest for strings like enum but not restricted to those values better editor for arrays of strings tag editor canvas based image editor that produces base data urls select selectize support  select support is enabled by default and will become active if the select library is detected selectize support is enabled via the following snippet jsoneditor plugins selectize enable true see the demo for an example of the array and select editor with selectize support enabled custom validation  json editor provides a hook into the validation engine for adding your own custom validation let s say you want to force all schemas with format set to date to match the pattern yyyy mm dd and and custom validators must return an array of errors or an empty array if valid jsoneditor defaults customvalidators push function schema value path var errors if schema format date if and          and test value and and errors must be an object with path  property  and message errors push path path property format  message dates must be in the format yyyy mm dd  return errors jquery integration   warning this style of usage is deprecated and may not be supported in future versions when jquery or zepto is loaded on the page you can use json editor like a normal jquery plugin if you prefer

3748229, rails api is a subset of a normal rails application created for applications that don t require all functionality that a complete rails application provides it is a bit more lightweight and consequently a bit faster than a normal rails application the main example for its usage is in api applications only where you usually don t need the entire rails middleware stack nor template generation this is a quick walk through to help you get up and running with rails api to create api only apps covering what rails api provides for api only applications how to decide which middlewares you will want to include how to decide which modules to use in your controller traditionally when people said that they used rails as an api  they meant providing a programmatically accessible api alongside their web application with the advent of client side frameworks more developers are using rails to build a backend that is shared between their web application and other native applications instead of using rails to generate dynamic html that will communicate with the server through forms and links many developers are treating their web application as just another client consuming a simple json api this guide covers building a rails application that serves json resources to an api client or client side framework the first question a lot of people have when thinking about building a json api using rails is isn t using rails to spit out some json overkill shouldn t i just use something like sinatra for very simple apis this may be true however even in very html heavy applications most of an application s logic is actually outside of the view layer the reason most people use rails is that it provides a set of defaults that allows us to get up and running quickly without having to make a lot of trivial decisions let s take a look at some of the things that rails provides out of the box that are still applicable to api applications reloading rails applications support transparent reloading this works even if your application gets big and restarting the server for every request becomes non viable development mode rails application come with smart defaults for development making development pleasant without compromising production time performance test mode ditto test mode logging rails applications log every request with a level of verbosity appropriate for the current mode rails logs in development include information about the request environment database queries and basic performance information parameter parsing want to specify your parameters as json instead of as a url encoded string no problem rails will decode the json for you and make it available in params want to use nested url encoded params that works too caching if you use dirty with public cache control rails will automatically cache your responses you can easily configure the cache store head requests rails will transparently convert head requests into get requests and return just the headers on the way out this makes head work reliably in all rails apis while you could obviously build these up in terms of existing rack middlewares i think this list demonstrates that the default rails middleware stack provides a lot of value even if you re just generating json resourceful routing if you re building a restful json api you want to be using the rails router clean and conventional mapping from http to controllers means not having to spend time thinking about how to model your api in terms of http header and redirection responses head nocontent and redirectto userurl currentuser come in handy sure you could manually add the response headers but why basic digest and token authentication rails comes with out of the box support for three kinds of http authentication instrumentation rails   added an instrumentation api that will trigger registered handlers for a variety of events such as action processing sending a file or data redirection and database queries the payload of each event comes with relevant information for the action processing event the payload includes the controller action params request format request method and the request s full path generators this may be pass for advanced rails users but it can be nice to generate a resource and get your model controller test stubs and routes created for you in a single command plugins many third party libraries come with support for rails that reduces or eliminates the cost of setting up and gluing together the library and the web framework this includes things like overriding default generators adding rake tasks and honoring rails choices like the logger and cache backend of course the rails boot process also glues together all registered components for example the rails boot process is what uses your config and database yml file when configuring activerecord the short version is you may not have thought about which parts of rails are still applicable even if you remove the view layer but the answer turns out to be most of it if you re building a rails application that will be an api server first and foremost you can start with a more limited subset of rails and add in features as needed note rails api only supports ruby    and above install the gem if you haven t already gem install rails api then generate a new rails api app rails api new myapi this will do two main things for you make applicationcontroller inherit from actioncontroller api instead of actioncontroller base as with middleware this will leave out any actioncontroller modules that provide functionality primarily used by browser applications configure the generators to skip generating views helpers and assets when you generate a new resource rails includes all of the sub frameworks activerecord actionmailer etc by default some api projects won t need them all so at the top of config and application rb you can replace require rails and all with specific sub frameworks config and application rb require activerecord and railtie require actioncontroller and railtie require actionmailer and railtie require sprockets and railtie require rails and testunit and railtie this can also be achieved with flags when creating a new rails api app rails api new myapi skip active record skip sprockets note there are references to actionmailer and activerecord in the various config and environment files if you decide to exclude any of these from your project its best to comment these out in case you need them later comment out this in config and environments and development rb config activerecord migrationerror pageload config actionmailer raisedeliveryerrors false comment out this in config and environments and test rb config actionmailer deliverymethod test if you want to take an existing app and make it a rails api app you ll have to do some quick setup manually add the gem to your gemfile gem rails api and run bundle to install the gem change app and controllers and applicationcontroller rb class applicationcontroller actioncontroller base class applicationcontroller actioncontroller api and comment out the protectfromforgery call if you are using it you aren t using cookie based authentication for your api are you if you want to use the rails default middleware stack avoid the reduction that rails api does  you can just add config apionly false to config and application rb file we suggest using activemodel serializers ams to serialize your activemodel and activerecord objects into the desired response format e g json an api application comes with the following middlewares by default actiondispatch debugexceptions log exceptions actiondispatch paramsparser parse xml yaml and json parameters when the request s content type is one of those actiondispatch reloader in development mode support code reloading actiondispatch remoteip protect against ip spoofing attacks actiondispatch requestid makes a unique request id available sending the id to the client via the x request id header the unique request id can be used to trace a request end to end and would typically end up being part of log files from multiple pieces of the stack actiondispatch showexceptions rescue exceptions and re dispatch them to an exception handling application rack cache caches responses with public cache control headers using http caching semantics rack head dispatch head requests as get requests and return only the status code and headers rack conditionalget supports the stale feature in rails controllers rack etag automatically set an etag on all string responses this means that if the same response is returned from a controller for the same url the server will return a  not modified  even if no additional caching steps are taken this is primarily a client side optimization it reduces bandwidth costs but not server processing time rack lock if your application is not marked as threadsafe config threadsafe  this middleware will add a mutex around your requests rack runtime adds a header to the response listing the total runtime of the request rack sendfile uses a front end server s file serving support from your rails application rails rack logger log the request started and flush all loggers after it other plugins including activerecord  may add additional middlewares in general these middlewares are agnostic to the type of app you are building and make sense in an api only rails application you can get a list of all middlewares in your application via rake middleware rails ships with a number of other middlewares that you might want to use in an api app especially if one of your api clients is the browser rack methodoverride allows the use of the method hack to route post requests to other verbs actiondispatch cookies supports the cookie method in actioncontroller  including support for signed and encrypted cookies actiondispatch flash supports the flash mechanism in actioncontroller actiondispatch beststandards tells internet explorer to use the most standards compliant available renderer in production mode if chromeframe is available use chromeframe session management if a config sessionstore is supplied and config apionly false  this middleware makes the session available as the session method in actioncontroller any of these middlewares can be added via config middleware use rack methodoverride if you don t want to use a middleware that is included by default in the api middleware set you can remove it using config middleware delete config middleware delete rack sendfile keep in mind that removing these features may remove support for certain features in actioncontroller an api application using actioncontroller api comes with the following controller modules by default actioncontroller urlfor makes urlfor and friends available actioncontroller redirecting support for redirectto actioncontroller rendering basic support for rendering actioncontroller renderers all support for render json and friends actioncontroller conditionalget support for stale actioncontroller forcessl support for forcessl actioncontroller rackdelegation support for the request and response methods returning actiondispatch request and actiondispatch response objects actioncontroller datastreaming support for sendfile and senddata abstractcontroller callbacks support for beforefilter and friends actioncontroller rescue support for rescuefrom other plugins may add additional modules you can get a list of all modules included into actioncontroller api in the rails console actioncontroller api ancestors actioncontroller metal ancestors all action controller modules know about their dependent modules so you can feel free to include any modules into your controllers and all dependencies will be included and set up as well some common modules you might want to add abstractcontroller translation support for the l and t localization and translation methods these delegate to in translate and in localize actioncontroller httpauthentication basic controllermethods or digest or token support for basic digest or token http authentication actionview layouts support for layouts when rendering actioncontroller mimeresponds and actioncontroller implicitrender for rails  support for content negotiation respondto  respondwith actioncontroller cookies support for cookies  which includes support for signed and encrypted cookies this requires the cookie middleware the best place to add a module is in your applicationcontroller you can also add modules to individual controllers  fork it  create your feature branch git checkout b my new feature  commit your changes git commit am added some feature  push

require the machine to be unlocked backdoors and remote access persist even after device is removed and attacker sashays away  live demonstration and more details available in the video released november   poisontap produces a cascading effect by exploiting the existing trust in various mechanisms of a machine and network including usb and thunderbolt dhcp dns and http to produce a snowball effect of information exfiltration network access and installation of semi permanent backdoors in a nutshell poisontap performs the following poisontap emulates an ethernet device eg ethernet over usb and thunderbolt by default windows os x and linux recognize an ethernet device automatically loading it as a low priority network device and performing a dhcp request across it even when the machine is locked or password protected poisontap responds to the dhcp request and provides the machine with an ip address however the dhcp response is crafted to tell the machine that the entire ipv space         is part of the poisontap s local network rather than a small subnet eg         normally it would be irrelevant if a secondary network device connects to a machine as it will be given lower priority than the existing trusted network device and won t supersede the gateway for internet traffic but any routing table and gateway priority and network interface service order security is bypassed due to the priority of lan traffic over internet traffic poisontap exploits this network access even as a low priority network device because the subnet of a low priority network device is given higher priority than the gateway default route of the highest priority network device this means if traffic is destined to     while normally this traffic would hit the default route and gateway of the primary non poisontap network device poisontap actually gets the traffic because the poisontap local network and subnet supposedly contains     and every other ip address in existence because of this all internet traffic goes over poisontap even though the machine is connected to another network device with higher priority and proper gateway the true wifi ethernet etc you can see this for yourself go into your devtools and inspector typically cmd and shift and i or ctrl and shift and i  go to a heavily visited website click on the network tab and watch as remote resources continue to be accessed even as you take no action on the page if the dns server is pointing to an internal ip lan that poisontap cannot get privilege for the attack continues to function as the internal dns server will produce public ip addresses for the various domains attacked and it is the public ip addresses that poisontap has already hijacked once the internal dns server responds the web browser hits the public ip ultimately hitting the poisontap web server node js in either scenario when the node web server receives the request poisontap responds with a response that can be interpreted as html or as javascript both of which execute properly many websites will load html or js in background requests the html and js agnostic page then produces many hidden iframes each iframe across a different alexa top  million domain any x frame options security on the domain is bypassed as poisontap is now the http server and chooses which headers to send to the client any httponly cookie security is bypassed and those cookies are captured as no javascript is executed on the domain itself but rather only used to load the iframe in the first place any cross origin resource sharing or same origin policy security is bypassed as the domain being accessed appears legitimate to the browser because we re capturing cookies rather than credentials any fa and mfa implemented on the site is bypassed when the attacker uses the cookie to login this is because we re not actually performing the login function but rather continuing an already logged in session which does not trigger two factor authentication while poisontap was producing thousands of iframes forcing the browser to load each one these iframes are not just blank pages at all but rather html and javascript backdoors that are cached indefinitely because poisontap force caches these backdoors on each domain the backdoor is tied to that domain enabling the attacker to use the domain s cookies and launch same origin requests in the future even if the user is currently not logged in additional http headers are added to cache the page indefinitely the actual response of the page is a combination of html and javascript that produces a persistent websocket out to the attacker s web server over the internet not on the poisontap device the websocket remains open allowing the attacker to at any point in the future connect back to the backdoored machine and perform requests across any origin that has the backdoor implemented the alexa top  sites see below again any x frame options  cross origin resource sharing and same origin policy security on the domain is entirely bypassed as the request will hit the cache that poisontap left rather than the true domain the one network poisontap is not able to hijack is the actual lan subnet of the true network interface for example if the user s wifi subnet is    x this network is unaffected  but poisontap force caches a backdoor on a special host specifically the target router s ip prepended to ip samy pl  e g     ip samy pl essentially producing a persistent dns rebinding attack when using poisontap as the dns server victim using public dns server  poisontap responds with the specialized poisontap ip temporarily      meaning any requests at that moment will hit the poisontap web server if instead the dns server is set to the internal network e g     x  an additional specially crafted request is made to     pin ip samy pl which tells my specialized dns server on the public internet to temporarily respond to any ip address ip samy pl address with the pinned address     for several seconds this means if loading the     ip samy pl and poisontap host in an iframe remotely over the backdoor you can now perform ajax get and posts to any other page on the internal router entirely remotely  thus allowing remote access to the internal router this can lead to other attacks on the router which the attacker may have never had access to in the first place such as default admin credentials on the router being used to overwrite dns servers or other authentication vulnerabilities being exposed ip addy ip samy pl normally responds with ip addy     ip samy pl     a record ip addy pin ip samy pl temporarily  seconds points ip samy pl to ip addy     pin ip samy pl         ip samy pl     a record short ttl after  seconds     ip samy pl     a record additionally poisontap replaces thousands of common cdn based javascript files e g google and jquery cdns with the correct code plus a backdoor that gives the attacker access to any domain loading the infected cdn based javascript file because a backdoor is left on each domain this allows the attacker to remotely force the backdoored browser to perform same origin requests ajax get and posts on virtually any major domain even if the victim does not currently have any open windows to that domain the backdoor will now live on any additional site that also uses one of these infected http based cdn javascript frameworks when the victim visits the site if you are running a web server securing against poisontap is simple use https exclusively  at the very least for authentication and authenticated content honestly you should use https exclusively and always redirect http content to https preventing a user being tricked into providing credentials or other pii over http ensure secure flag is enabled on cookies preventing https cookies from leaking over http closing your browser every time you walk away from your machine can work but is entirely impractical disabling usb and thunderbolt ports is also effective though also impractical locking your computer has no effect as the network and usb stacks operate while the machine is locked however going into an encrypted sleep mode where a key is required to decrypt memory e g  filevault and deep sleep solves most of the issues as your browser will no longer make requests even if woken up sudo bash branch next rpi update echo e nauto usb nallow hotplug usb niface usb inet static n taddress     n tnetmask     and etc and network and interfaces echo dtoverlay dwc and boot and config txt echo e dwc ngether and etc and modules sudo sed in place and exit  and d and etc and rc local echo and bin and sh and home and pi and poisontap and pistartup sh and etc and rc local mkdir and home and pi and poisontap chown r pi and home and pi and poisontap apt get update apt get upgrade apt get y install isc dhcp server dsniff screen nodejs place dhcpd conf in and etc and dhcp and dhcpd conf and the rest of the files in and home and pi and poisontap then reboot to ensure everything is working backendserver js this is the node js server that you run on your internet accessible server it is what the backdoor html connects to eg samy pl  this is the same server you connect to send commands to your poisontapped minion machines eg pipoisontap js this runs via node js on the raspberry pi zero and is the http server responsible for handling any http requests intercepted by poisontap storing siphoned cookies and injecting the cached backdoors pistartup sh this runs upon startup on the raspberry pi zero in order to set the device up to emulate an ethernet over usb gadget set up our evil dhcp server allow traffic rerouting dns spoofing and to launch pipoisontap js above targetbackdoor js this file is prepended to any cdn related javascript files thus backdooring them e g google cdn s jquery url poisontap cookies log this file is generated once the user s machine starts sending http requests to poisontap and logs the cookie from the browser along with the associated url and domain it belongs to q how do you add additional domains to be backdoored a the list of domains to be backdoored is set in targetinjectedxhtmljs html by the getdoms function this itself is populated by the alexam sh script in the root of the repo if you wish to add additional domains to this list you can simply amend the return call in getdoms q how do you use the captured cookies q how do i clean poisontap from a machine a you should clear the local os dns cache as well as any browser caches you may also need to invalidate any logged in sessions at the time which may have leaked cookies ensure that these invalidate existing cookies rather than simply logging you out if you want to safetly work with a poisontap device on your current machine make sure to exit any browser then you should be able to safetly connect it to your machine

and enjoy node server js net welcomes javascript if you want to use net core as your runtime and are running in a dual runtime environment i e windows with net   installed as well or linux with mono installed  you will need to tell edge to use net core by setting the edgeusecoreclr environment variable edgeusecoreclr  node server js net welcomes javascript edge provides several ways to integrate c code into a node js application regardless of the way you choose the entry point into the net code is normalized to a func objecttask object delegate this allows node js code to call net asynchronously and avoid blocking the node js event loop edge provides a function that accepts a reference to c code in one of the supported representations and returns a node js function which acts as a javascript proxy to the func objecttask object net delegate javascript var edge require edge var myfunction edge func the function proxy can then be called from node js like any asynchronous function javascript myfunction some input  function error result and and alternatively if you know the c implementation will complete synchronously given the circumstances you can call this function as any synchronous javascript function as follows javascript var result myfunction some input  true the true parameter instead of a callback indicates that node js expects the c implementation to complete synchronously if the clr function implementation does not complete synchronously the call above will result in an exception one representation of clr code that edge js accepts is c source code you can embed c literal representing a net async lambda expression implementing the func objecttask object delegate directly inside node js code javascript var add edge func async input return int input and  in another representation you can embed multi line c source code by providing a function with a body containing a multi line comment edge extracts the c code from the function body using regular expressions javascript var add edge func function and async input return int input and  javascript var add edge func async input return int input and  if your c code is more involved than a simple lambda you can specify entire class definition by convention the class must be named startup and it must have an invoke method that matches the func objecttask object delegate signature this method is useful if you need to factor your code into multiple methods javascript var add edge func function and using system threading tasks public class startup public async task object invoke object input  int v int input return helper addseven v  static class helper public static int addseven int v  return v and   if your c code grows substantially it is useful to keep it in a separate file you can save it to a file with csx or cs extension and then reference from your node js application javascript var add edge func require path join dirname add csx if you integrate c code into your node js application by specifying c source using one of the methods above edge will compile the code on the fly if you prefer to pre compile your c sources to a clr assembly or if your c component is already pre compiled you can reference a clr assembly from your node js code in the most generic form you can specify the assembly file name the type name and the method name when creating a node js proxy to a net method javascript var clrmethod edge func assemblyfile my edge samples dll  typename samples foobar mytype  methodname mymethod and and this must be func objecttask object if you don t specify methodname invoke is assumed if you don t specify typename a type name is constructed by assuming the class called startup in the namespace equal to the assembly file name without the dll in the example above if typename was not specified it would default to my edge samples startup the assemblyfile is relative to the working directory if you want to locate your assembly in a fixed location relative to your node js application it is useful to construct the assemblyfile using dirname if you are using net core assemblyfile can also be a project name or nuget package name that is specified in your project json or deps json dependency manifest you can also create node js proxies to net functions specifying just the assembly name as a parameter javascript var clrmethod edge func my edge samples dll in that case the default typename of my edge samples startup and methodname of invoke is assumed as explained above when you provide c source code and let edge compile it for you at runtime edge will by default reference only mscorlib dll and system dll assemblies if you re using net core we automatically reference the most recent versions of the system runtime system threading tasks system dynamic runtime and the compiler language packages like microsoft csharp in applications that require additional assemblies you can specify them in c code using a special hash pattern similar to roslyn for example to use ado net you must reference system data dll javascript var add edge func function and r system data dll using system data using system threading tasks public class startup public async task object invoke object input  and and  if you prefer instead of using comments you can specify references by providing options to the edge func call javascript var add edge func source function and using system data using system threading tasks public class startup  public async task object invoke object input  and and   references system data dll set edgeapproot c dotnet myproject bin release netstandard  node app js edge js also supports running published net core applications on servers that do not have the net core sdk and cli installed which is a common scenario in production environments to do so the project json for your application should meet the following requirements  it should target the netcoreapp  framework moniker  it should reference microsoft netcore dotnethost and microsoft netcore dotnethostpolicy this is required so that the publish process can provide all the native libraries required to create a completely standalone version of your application  emitentrypoint true should be present under buildoptions you can add an empty main implementation to your project to accomodate it this method will not be called but is just a requirement in order for dotnet publish to generate a completely standalone app on your development machine you would run dotnet publish r target runtime for your production server i e dotnet publish r ubuntu   x to aggregate the package assemblies and native libraries necessary to run your application you can copy the contents of the publish directory up to your sdk and cli less server and use them directly in edge js by setting the edgeapproot environment variable to the directory on the server that you copied the published application to edge js can marshal any json serializable value between net and node js although json serialization is not used in the process edge also supports marshalling between node js buffer instance and a clr byte array to help you efficiently pass binary data you can call net from node js and pass in a complex javascript object as follows javascript var dotnetfunction edge func edge sample dll var payload aninteger  anumber   astring foo  aboolean true abuffer new buffer   anarray  foo  anobject a foo  b  dotnetfunction payload function error result in net javascript objects are represented as dynamics which can be cast to idictionary stringobject if desired  javascript arrays as object  and javascript buffer as byte scalar javascript values have their corresponding net types int  double  bool  string here is how you can access the data in net using system threading tasks public class startup public async task object invoke dynamic input int aninteger int input aninteger double anumber double input anumber string astring string input astring bool aboolean bool input aboolean byte abuffer byte input abuffer object anarray object input anarray dynamic anobject dynamic input anobject return null similar type marshalling is applied when net code passes data back to node js code in net code you can provide an instance of any clr type that would normally be json serializable including domain specific types like person or anonymous objects for example using system threading tasks public class person public int aninteger  public double anumber   public string astring foo public bool aboolean true public byte abuffer new byte  public object anarray new object  foo public object anobject new a foo  b  public class startup public async task object invoke dynamic input person person new person return person in your node js code that invokes this net method you can display the result object that the callback method receives javascript var edge require edge var getperson edge func function and using system threading tasks public class person public int aninteger  public double anumber   public string astring foo public bool aboolean true public byte abuffer new byte  public object anarray new object  foo public object anobject new a foo  b  public class startup public async task object invoke dynamic input  person person new person return person  getperson null function error result if error throw error console log result passing this net object to node js generates a javascript object as follows node sample js aninteger  anumber   astring foo  aboolean true abuffer buffer            anarray  foo  anobject a foo  b  when data is marshalled from net to node js no checks for circular references are made they will typically result in stack overflows make sure the object graph you are passing from net to node js is a tree and does not contain any cycles set edgeenablescriptignoreattribute  edge js by default does not observe the scriptignoreattribute to avoid the associated performance cost in addition to marshalling data edge can marshal proxies to javascript functions when invoking net code from node js this allows net code to call back into node js suppose the node js application passes an add function to the net code as a property of an object the function receives two numbers and returns the sum of them via the provided callback javascript var edge require edge var addandmultiplyby edge func function and async dynamic input var add func object task object input add var twonumbers new a int input a b int input b var addresult int await add twonumbers return addresult  var payload a  b  add function data callback callback null data a and data b addandmultiplyby payload function error result if error throw error console log result the net code implements the addandmultiplyby function it extracts the two numbers passed from node js calls back into the add function exported from node js to add them multiplies the result by  in net and returns the result back to node js node sample js the node js function exported from node js to net must follow the prescriptive async pattern of accepting two parameters payload and a callback the callback function accepts two parameters the first one is the error if any and the second the result of the operation javascript function payload callback var error and and must be null or undefined in the absence of error var result and and do something callback error result the proxy to that function in net has the following signature func objecttask object using tpl in clr to provide a proxy to an asynchronous node js function allows the net code to use the convenience of the await keyword when invoking the node js functionality the example above shows the use of the await keyword when calling the proxy of the node js add method similarly to marshalling functions from node js to net edge js can also marshal functions from net to node js the net code can export a func objecttask object delegate to node js as part of the return value of a net method invocation for example javascript var createhello edge func function and async input return func objecttask object async i console writeline hello from net return null  var hello createhello null true hello null true and and prints out hello from net this mechanism in conjunction with a closure can be used to expose clr class instances or clr state in general to javascript for example javascript var createcounter edge func function and async input var k int input return func objecttask object async i return and and k var counter createcounter  true and and create counter with  as initial state console log counter null true and and prints  console log counter null true and and prints  note this functionality requires ironpython and has been tested on windows only edge js enables you to run python and node js in process install edge and edge py modules npm install edge npm install edge py in your server js javascript var edge require edge var hello edge func py  function and def hello input return python welcomes and input lambda x hello x hello node js  function error result if error throw error console log result run and enjoy node py js python welcomes node js your python script must evaluate to a lambda expression that accepts a single parameter the parameter represents marshalled input from the node js code the return value of the lambda expression is passed back as the result to node js code the python script can contain constructs e g python functions that are used in the closure of the lambda expression the instance of the script with associated state is created when edge func is called in node js each call to the function referes to that instance the simplest echo python script you can embed in node js looks like this python lambda x x to say hello you can use something like this python lambda x hello and x to maintain a running sum of numbers python current  def add x global current current current and x return current lambda x add x you can reference python script stored in a py file instead of embedding python code in a node js script in your hello py file python def hello input return python welcomes and input lambda x hello x in your hello js file javascript var edge require edge var hello edge func py  hello py hello node js  function error result if error throw error console log result run and enjoy node hello js python welcomes node js in the examples above python script was executing asynchronously on its own thread without blocking the singleton v thread on which the node js event loop runs this means your node js application remains responsive while the python code executes in the background if you know your python code is non blocking or if you know what you are doing you can tell edge js to execute python code on the singleton v thread this will improve performance for non blocking python scripts embedded in a node js application javascript var edge require edge var hello edge func py  source function and def hello input return python welcomes and input lambda x hello x sync true console log hello node js  true the sync true property in the call to edge func tells edge js to execute python code on the v thread as opposed to creating a new thread to run python script on the true parameter in the call to hello requests that edge js does in fact call the hello function synchronously i e return the result as opposed to calling a callback function note this functionality only works on windows install edge and

next to the node exe file note this is windows only functionality on windows you can debug the net code running as part of your node js application by attaching a managed code debugger e g visual studio to node exe you can debug net code in a pre compiled clr assembly as well c literals embedded in the application and compiled by edge js at runtime if you have integrated net code into a node js application using a pre compiled clr assembly like this javascript var hello edge func my assembly dll then the best way to debug your net code is to attach a managed code debugger e g visual studio to the node exe process since the node exe process runs both native and managed code make sure to select managed code type as target from there you can set breakpoints in your net code and the debugger will stop when they are reached debugging embedded c code on windows requires that edgecsdebug environment variable is set in the environment of the node exe process set edgecsdebug  without this setting the default  edge js will not generate debugging information when compiling embedded c code you can debug c code embedded into a node js application using a reference to a cs or csx file javascript var hello edge func myclass cs you can also debug c code embedded directly into a js file using the function comment syntax javscript var hello edge func function and async input system diagnostics debugger break var result net welcomes and input tostring return result you cannot debug c code embedded as a simple string literal javascript var hello edge func async input return  int input after setting edgecsdebug  environment variable before starting node exe and attaching the managed debugger to the node exe process you can set breakpoints in c code which may appear as a javascript comment  or use system diagnostics debugger break to break into the debugger from net code you must have visual studio  toolset python   x and node gyp installed for building to build and test the project against all supported versions of node js in x and x flavors run the following tools buildall bat test testall bat npm run jshint build bat release    to build the c and and cli native extension using the version of node js installed on your machine issue the following command npm install g node gyp node gyp configure msvsversion  node gyp build debug you can then set the edgenative environment variable to the fully qualified file name of the built edge node binary edge nativeclr node if you re using the native clr runtime or edge coreclr node if you re using net core it is useful during development for example set edgenative c projects edge build debug edgenativeclr node you can also set the edgedebug environment variable to  to have the edge module generate debug traces to the console when it runs you must have mocha installed on the system then or from the root of the enlistment mocha r spec note in environments with both desktop clr and mono and net core installed tests will by default use desktop clr and mono to run tests against net core use edgeusecoreclr  npm test note this is windows only functionality if you want to run tests after building against a specific version of node js that one of the previous builds used issue the following command test bat ia    which will run the tests using node js x v   similarly test bat x    would run tests against node js    on x architecture lastly you can run jshint on the project with npm run jshint prerequisities you can use edge js on osx with either mono or net core installed or both then install and build edge js brew install pkg config npm install edge note if the build process complains about being unable to locate mono libraries you may need to specify the search path explicitly this may be installation dependent but in most cases will look like pkgconfigpath and library and frameworks and mono framework and versions and current and lib and pkgconfig npm install edge if you installed both mono and net core by default edge will use mono you opt in to using net core with the edgeusecoreclr environment variable edgeusecoreclr  node myapp js to build edge from a clone of the repository or source code node gyp configure build to build a debug build instead of release you need to node gyp configure build debug export edgenative and users and tomek and edge and build and debug and edgenativeclr node if you have only net core installed on your system and not mono you can run edge with no changes however if you have both runtimes installed edge will automatically use mono unless directed otherwise to use net core in a dual runtime environment set the edgeusecoreclr  environment variable when starting node i e edgeusecoreclr  node sample js edge will try to find the net core runtime in the following locations the path in the coreclrdir environment variable if provided the current directory the directory containing edge node directories in the path environment variable once a directory containing the dotnet executable is located we then do the following to decide which version of the framework you can have several installed at once to load if the coreclrversion environment variable was specified we try to load that version else if the project json and deps json has a reference to microsoft netcore app  indicating that it was built for a specific framework version we try to load that version otherwise we pick the maximum installed version so if the clr is another location or you want to use a version of the clr other than the default that you ve set the best way to specify that is through the coreclrdir or coreclrversion environment variables i e edgeusecoreclr  coreclrdir and usr and share and dotnet and dnx coreclr linux x    beta  node sample js if you are writing a clr application e g a c console application or asp net web app  this section explains how you include and run node js code in your app currently it works on windows using desktop clr but support for macos and linux as well as net core is coming soon you need windows with edge js support for scripting node js ships as a nuget package called edge js it comes with everything you need to get started writing applications for x and x architectures however if you want to use additional node js packages from npm you must separately install node js runtime to access the npm package manager the latest edge js nuget package has been developed and tested with node js v   older edge js packages exist for prior versions of node js if you choose a different version of node js to install npm packages your mileage can vary note you cannot use native node js extensions when scripting node js from clr using edge create a net   console application in visual studio add the edge js nuget package to the project then in your code using system using system threading tasks using edgejs class program public static async task start var func edge func return function data callback callback null node js welcomes and data   console writeline await func net static void main string args start wait compile and run c project sample bin debug sample exe node js welcomes net the edge js nuget package contains a single managed assembly edgejs dll with a single class edgejs edge exposing a single static function func the function accepts a string containing code in node js that constructs and returns a javascript function the javascript function must have the signature required by edge js s prescriptive interop pattern it must accept one parameter and a callback and the callback must be called with an error and one return value var func edge func return function data callback callback null hello and data edge js creates a func objecttask object delegate in clr that allows net code to call the node js function asynchronously you can use the standard tpl mechanisms or the async and await keywords to conveniently await completion of the asynchornous node js function var result await func net and and result hello net note that the node js code snippet is not a function definition instead it must create and return a function instance this allows you to initialize and maintain encapsulated node js state associated with the instance of the created function the initialization code will execute only once when you call edge func conceptually this is similar to defining a node js module that exports a single function by returning it to the caller for example var increment edge func var current  return function data callback current and data callback null current console writeline await increment  and and outputs  console writeline await increment  and and outputs  using multiline c string literals is convenient for short node js code snippets but you may want to store larger node js code in its own js file or files one pattern is to store your node js code in a myfunc js file javascript return function data callback callback null node js welcomes and data and then load such file into memory with file var func edge func file readalltext myfunc js another pattern is to define a node js module that itself is a function javascript module exports function data callback callback null node js welcomes and data and then load and return this module with a short snippet of node js var func edge func return require and and myfunc js note the relative location of the file you can use node js built in modules out of the box for example you can set up a node js http server hosted in a net application and call it from c var createhttpserver edge func var http require http return function port cb var server http createserver function req res res end hello world and new date listen port cb await createhttpserver  you can use external node js modules for example modules installed from npm note most node js modules are written in javascript and will execute in edge as is however some node js external modules are native binary modules rebuilt by npm on module installation to suit your local execution environment native binary modules will not run in edge unless they are rebuilt to link against the nodejs dll that edge uses c projects websockets npm install ws ws    nodemodules ws    tinycolor       options       nan       commander    you can then use the installed ws module to create a websocket server inside of a net application class program public static async void start var createwebsocketserver edge func var websocketserver require ws server return function port cb var wss new websocketserver port port wss on connection  function ws ws on message  function message ws send message touppercase  ws send hello  cb   await createwebsocketserver  static void main string args task run action start new manualresetevent false waitone this websocket server sends a hello message to the client when a new connection is established and then echos a capitalized version of every message it receives back to the client you can test this webserver with the wscat tool included with the ws module to make it convenient to use first install the ws module globally npm install ws g then start the net application conatining the websocket server and establish a connection to it with wscat c projects websockets wscat c ws and and localhost  and connected press ctrl and c to quit a self contained node js websocket server even if running within a net application is rather unexciting after all the same could be accomplished with a stand alone node js process ideally you could extablish a websocket server in node js but handle the messages in net let s do it read on it is often useful to handle certain events raised by the node js code within net for example you may want to establish a websocket server in node js and handle the incoming messages in the net part of your application this can be accomplished by passig a net callback function to node js when the the websocket server is created class program public static async void start and and define an event handler to be called for every message from the client var onmessage func object task object async message  return received string of length and string message length  and and the websocket server delegates handling of messages from clients and and to the supplied net handler var createwebsocketserver edge func var websocketserver require ws server return function options cb var wss new websocketserver port options port wss on connection  function ws ws on message  function message options onmessage message function error result if error throw error ws send result   ws send hello  cb   and and create a websocket server on a specific tcp port and using the net event handler await createwebsocketserver new  port  onmessage onmessage  static void main string args task run action start new manualresetevent false waitone using wscat  you can verify the net handler is indeed invoked for every websocket message c projects websockets wscat c ws and and localhost  and connected press ctrl and c to quit received string of length  received string of length  this example shows how edge js can create javascript proxies to net functions and marshal calls across the v and clr boundary in process read more about data marshaling between node js and clr how to marshal data between c and nodejs in the previous example a node js http server was created and started from net how to use nodejs built in modules suppose at some point you want to stop the http server from your net code given that all references to it are embedded within node js code it is not possible however just as edge js can pass a net function to node js how to handle nodejs events in net  it also can export a node js function to net moreover that function can be implemented as a closure over node js state this is how it would work var createhttpserver edge func var http require http return function port cb var server http createserver function req res res end hello world and new date listen port function error cb error function data cb server close cb   var closehttpserver func objecttask object await createhttpserver  await closehttpserver null notice how the createhttpserver function in addition to starting an http server in node js is also returning a net proxy to a javascript function that allows that server to be stopped using node js via edge js in asp net web applications is no different than in a net console application the edge js nuget package must be referenced in your asp net web application if you are using any external node js modules the entire nodemodules subdirectory structure must be binplaced to the bin folder of you web application and deployed that way to the server note this mechanism requires hardening expect the road ahead to be bumpy these are unstructions for building the edge js nuget package on windows the package will support running apps in both x and x architectures using a selected version of node js the resulting nuget package is all inclusive with the only dependency being net   preprequisties visual studio  node js tested with v   python   x node gyp tested with    to buid the nuget package open the visual studio  developer command prompt and call tools builddouble bat    you can substitite another version of node js the script takes several minutes to complete and does the following builds a few helper tools in c downloads sources of the selected node js version builds node js shared library for the x and x flavor builds edge js module for the x and x flavor builds managed edgejs dll library that bootstraps running node js in a clr process and provides the edge func programming model packs everything into a nuget package if everything goes well the resulting nuget package is located in the tools build nuget directory there are functional tests in test double doubletest and stress tests in test double doublestress before you can compile these tests you must register the location of the built nuget package as a local nuget feed through the nuget configuration manager in visual studio after you have compiled the function tests the best way to run them is from the command line c projects edge test double doubletests bin release mstest and testcontainer doubletest dll and noisolation after you have compiled the stress tests simply launch the executable attach resource monitor to the process and leave it running to observe stability c projects edge test double doublestress bin release doublestress exe i do welcome contributions via pull request and derived work the edge module is intended to remain a very small component with core functionality that supports interop between net and node js domain

quite different with phantomjs  so when you update old visual tests will start failing if your tests are green and passing before updating i would recommend rebasing the visual tests i e delete them and run the test suite to create a new baseline phantomcss can be downloaded in various ways npm install phantomcss phantomcss is not itself a node js module bower install phantomcss git clone git and and github com and huddle and phantomcss git if you are not installing via npm you will need to run npm install in the phantomcss root folder please note that depending on how you have installed

change some css in the file demo and coffeemachine html e g make mug bright green run the tests again you should see some reported failures in the failures folder some images should have been created

responsive feedback form try not to use complex css selectors for asserting or creating screenshots in the same way that css should be written with good content and container separation so should your test selectors be agnostic of location and context this might mean you need to add more id s or data attributes into your mark up but it s worth it your tests will be more stable and more explicit this is not a good idea javascript phantomcss screenshot sidebar li nth child  div form but this is javascript phantomcss screenshot feedback form if you needed functional tests before then you still need them automated visual regression testing gives us coverage of css and design in a way we didn t have before but that doesn t mean that conventional test assertions are now invalid feedback time is crucial with test automation the longer it takes the easier it is to ignore the easier it is to ignore the sooner trust is lost from the team unfortunately comparing images is not and never will be as fast as simple dom assertion i d argue this applies to all automated testing approaches as a rule try to maximise coverage with fewer tests this is a difficult balancing act because granular feedback and reporting is very important for debugging and build analysis testing many things in one assert and screenshot might tell you there is a problem but makes it harder to get to the root of the bug as a css and html dev you ll know what components are more fragile than others which are reused and which aren t concentrate your visual tests on these areas if you try to test too much in one screenshot then you could end up with lots of failing tests every time someone makes a small change say you ve set up full page visual regression tests for your  page website and someone adds px padding to the footer that s  failed tests because of one change it s better to test ui components individually in this example the footer could have its own test there is also a technical problem with this approach the larger the image the longer it takes to process an added pixel padding on the page body will offset everything at best you ll have a sea of pink in the failed diff at worse you ll get a timeout because it took too long to analyse javascript phantomcss screenshot feedback form  undefined input type file below is an example of a false negative caused by antialiasing

31871464, blackbird bitcoin arbitrage is a c and and trading system that does automatic long and short arbitrage between bitcoin exchanges bitcoin is still a new and inefficient market several bitcoin exchanges exist around the world and the bid and ask prices they propose can be briefly different from an exchange to another the purpose of blackbird is to automatically profit from these temporary price differences while being market neutral here is a real example where an arbitrage opportunity exists between bitstamp long and bitfinex short at the first vertical line the spread between the exchanges is high so blackbird buys bitstamp and short sells bitfinex then when the spread closes second vertical line  blackbird exits the market by selling bitstamp and buying bitfinex back unlike other bitcoin arbitrage systems blackbird doesn t sell but actually short sells bitcoin on the short exchange this feature offers two important advantages  the strategy is always market neutral the bitcoin market s moves up or down don t impact the strategy returns this removes a huge risk from the strategy the bitcoin market could suddenly lose half its value that this won t make any difference in the strategy returns  the strategy doesn t need to transfer funds usd or btc between bitcoin exchanges the buy and sell and sell and buy trading activities are done in parallel on two different exchanges independently advantage no need to deal with transfer latency issues use the software at your own risk you are responsible for your own money past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results  the authors and all affiliates assume no responsibility for your trading results  the trade results are stored in csv files and the detailed activity is stored in log files new files are created every time blackbird is started it is possible to automatically stop blackbird after the next trade has closed by creating at any time an empty file named stopafternotrade please make sure that you understand the disclaimer above if you want to test blackbird with real money and start with a small amount of money important all your btc accounts must be empty before starting blackbird make sure that you only have usd on your accounts and no btc  it is never entirely safe to just tell blackbird to use say  per exchange you also need to only have  available on each of your trading accounts as well as  btc in this case you are sure that even with a bug your maximum loss on an exchange won t be greater than  no matter what note on bitfinex your money has to be available

14812903, a simple intuitive audio framework for ios and osx ezaudio has recently been deprecated in favor of audiokit however since some people are still forking and using ezaudio i ve decided to restore the readme as it was check out the note below deprecated i d really like to start creating a list of projects made using ezaudio if you ve used ezaudio to make something cool whether it s an app or open source visualization or whatever please email me at syedhali at gmail com and i ll add it to our wall of fame to start it off piano tuner home edition piano tuner pro edition music pitch detector piano prober multi tuner awesome components i ve designed six audio components and two interface components to allow you to immediately get your hands dirty recording playing and visualizing audio data these components simply plug into each other and build on top of the high performance low latency audiounits api and give you an easy to use api written in objective c instead of pure c ezaudiodevice ezaudiodevice a useful class for getting all the current and available inputs and output on any apple device the ezmicrophone and ezoutput use this to direct sound in and out from different hardware components ezmicrophone ezmicrophone a microphone class that provides its delegate audio data from the default device microphone with one line of code ezoutput ezoutput an output class that will playback any audio it is provided by its datasource ezaudiofile ezaudiofile an audio file class that reads and seeks through audio files and provides useful delegate callbacks ezaudioplayer ezaudioplayer a replacement for avaudioplayer that combines an ezaudiofile and a ezoutput to perform robust playback of any file on any piece of hardware ezrecorder ezrecorder a recorder class that provides a quick and easy way to write audio files from any datasource ezaudioplot ezaudioplot a core graphics based audio waveform plot capable of visualizing any float array as a buffer or rolling plot ezaudioplotgl ezaudioplotgl an opengl based gpu accelerated audio waveform plot capable of visualizing any float array as a buffer or rolling plot cross platform ezaudio was designed to work transparently across all ios and osx devices this means one universal api whether you re building for mac or ios for instance under the hood an ezaudioplot knows that it will subclass a uiview for ios or an nsview for osx and the ezmicrophone knows to build on top of the remoteio audiounit for ios but defaults to the system defaults for input and output for osx within this repo you ll find the examples for ios and osx to get you up to speed using each component and plugging them into each other with just a few lines of code you ll be recording from the microphone generating audio waveforms and playing audio files like a boss see the full getting started guide for an interactive look into each of components ezaudiocoregraphicswaveformexample shows how to use the ezmicrophone and ezaudioplot to visualize the audio data from the microphone in real time the waveform can be displayed as a buffer or a rolling waveform plot traditional waveform look ezaudioopenglwaveformexample shows how to use the ezmicrophone and ezaudioplotgl to visualize the audio data from the microphone in real time the drawing is using opengl so the performance much better for plots needing a lot of points ezaudioplayfileexample shows how to use the ezaudioplayer and ezaudioplotgl to playback pause and seek through an audio file while displaying its waveform as a buffer or a rolling waveform plot ezaudiorecordwaveformexample shows how to use the ezmicrophone  ezrecorder  and ezaudioplotgl to record the audio from the microphone input to a file while displaying the audio waveform of the incoming data you can then playback the newly recorded audio file using avfoundation and keep adding more audio data to the tail of the file ezaudiowaveformfromfileexample shows how to use the ezaudiofile and ezaudioplot to animate in an audio waveform for an entire audio file ezaudiopassthroughexample shows how to use the ezmicrophone  ezoutput  and the ezaudioplotgl to pass the microphone input to the output for playback while displaying the audio waveform as a buffer or rolling plot in real time ezaudiofftexample shows how to calculate the real time fft of the audio data coming from the ezmicrophone and the accelerate framework the audio data is plotted using two ezaudioplots for the time and frequency displays to begin using ezaudio you must first make sure you have the proper build requirements and frameworks below you ll find explanations of each component and code snippets to show how to use each to perform common tasks like getting microphone data updating audio waveform plots reading and seeking through audio files and performing playback accelerate audiotoolbox avfoundation accelerate audiotoolbox audiounit coreaudio quartzcore pod ezaudio     if you re also using the amazing audio engine then use the ezaudio and core subspec like so pod ezaudio and core      ezaudio now supports carthage thanks andrew and tommaso you can refer to carthage s installation for a how to guide  alternatively you can check out the ios and mac examples for how to setup a project using the ezaudio project as an embedded project and utilizing the frameworks be sure to set your header search path to the folder containing the ezaudio source ezaudio currently offers six audio components that encompass a wide range of functionality in addition to the functional aspects of these components such as pulling audio data reading and writing from files and performing playback they also take special care to hook into the interface components to allow developers to display visual feedback see the interface components interfacecomponents below provides a simple interface for obtaining the current and all available inputs and output for any apple device for instance the iphone  has three microphones available for input while on osx you can choose the built in microphone or any available hal device on your system similarly for ios you can choose from a pair of headphones connected or speaker while on osx you can choose from the built in output any available hal device or airplay to get all the available input devices use the inputdevices class method objectivec nsarray inputdevices ezaudiodevice inputdevices or to just get the currently selected input device use the currentinputdevice method objectivec and and on ios this will default to the headset device or bottom microphone while on osx this will and and be your selected inpupt device from the sound preferences ezaudiodevice currentinputdevice ezaudiodevice currentinputdevice similarly to get all the available output devices use the outputdevices class method objectivec nsarray outputdevices ezaudiodevice outputdevices or to just get the currently selected output device use the currentinputdevice method objectivec and and on ios this will default to the headset speaker while on osx this will be your selected and and output device from the sound preferences ezaudiodevice currentoutputdevice ezaudiodevice currentoutputdevice provides access to the default device microphone in one line of code and provides delegate callbacks to receive the audio data as an audiobufferlist and float arrays relevant example projects ezaudiocoregraphicswaveformexample ios ezaudiocoregraphicswaveformexample osx ezaudioopenglwaveformexample ios ezaudioopenglwaveformexample

following people rock as of today june   i m officially deprecating ezaudio i d like to thank everyone for the support over the last few years i ve been hacking on ezaudio and working to make it better ezaudio started as a pet project of mine in  in an attempt to reduce the amount of duplicate code i was writing for my own ios and mac audio projects i originally just wanted to record audio from an iphone s mic and plot a waveform this over time quickly grew into the collection of classes you may know today ezmicrophone ezaudioplot etc i apologize for not being more active in addressing the issues and pull requests but i m hoping you all understand i m only one person ezaudio was solely written and maintained by me out of love during weeks of time i wasn t making any money all while living in one of the most expensive cities in the world like many of you i spend the majority of my time working full time to sustain myself i have bills and rent to pay too i m transitioning to non audio ventures and will hopefully be able to share another cool open source project soon enough getting the opportunity to work on ezaudio with all of you has been an incredibly insightful experience and i m incredibly grateful to have gotten a chance to share it with all of you thank you as i m writing this i m a little hesitant to say it s all broken despite all the issues filed  but i d recommend forking this repo from this point forward and using at your own risk i ll probably be continuing to use ezaudio s ezaudioplot for rendering waveforms in my future projects however please don t expect any updates to this repo deprecated means i won t be responding to issues ezaudio related emails or pushing any new changes to this repo

35507603, aerosolve  machine learning for humans what is it  a machine learning library designed from the ground up to be human friendly it is different from other machine learning libraries in the following ways this library is meant to be used with sparse interpretable features such as those that commonly occur in search search keywords filters or pricing number of rooms location price it is not as interpretable with problems with very dense non human interpretable features such as raw pixels or audio samples there are a few reasons to focus on interpretability your corpus is new and not fully defined and you want more insight into your corpus having interpretable models lets you iterate quickly figure out where the model disagrees most and have insight into what kind of new features are needed debugging noisy features by plotting the feature weights you can discover buggy features or fit them to splines and discover features that are unexpectedly complex which usually indicates overfitting you can discover relationships between different variables and your target prediction e g for the airbnb demand model plotting graphs of reviews and  star reviews is more interpretable than many nested if then else rules graph of reviews and  star reviews and feature weight reviews png how to get started  as a repository and automatically fetch the artifacts check out the image impression demo where you can learn how to teach the algorithm to paint in the pointillism style of painting there is also an income prediction demo based on a popular machine learning benchmark feature representation  features are grouped into logical groups called families of features the reason for this is so we can express transformations on an entire feature family at once or interact two different families of features together to create a new feature family there are three kinds of features per featurevector stringfeatures this is a map of feature family to binary feature strings for example geo san francisco  ca  usa floatfeatures this is a map of feature family to feature name and value for example loc latitude   longitude   densefeatures this is a map of feature family to a dense array of floats not really used except for the image content analysis code example representation  examples are the basic unit of creating training data and scoring a single example is composed of context this is a featurevector that occurs once in the example it could be the features representing a search session for example e g keyword free parking example  n this is a repeated list of featurevectors that represent the items being scored these can correspond to documents in a search session e g listing city san francisco the reasons for having this structure are having one context for hundreds of items saves a lot of space during rpcs or even on disk you can compute the transforms for the context once then apply the transformed context repeatedly in conjunction with each item having a list of items allows the use of list based loss functions such as pairwise ranking loss domination loss etc where we evaluate multiple items at once feature transform language  feature transforms allow us to modify featurevectors on the fly this allows engineers to rapidly iterate on feature engineering quickly and in a controlled way here are some examples of feature transforms that are commonly used although there are several models in the model directory only two are the main debuggable models the rest are experimental or sub models that create transforms for the interpretable models supports hinge logistic epsilon insensitive regression ranking loss functions only operates on stringfeatures the label for the task is stored in a special feature family and specified by rankkey in the config note that in conjunction with quantization and crosses you can get incredible amounts of complexity from the linear model so it is not actually your regular linear model but something more complex and can be thought of as a bushy very wide decision tree with millions of branches a general additive linear piecewise spline model the training is done at a higher resolution specified by numbuckets between the min and max of a feature s range at the end of each iteration we attempt to project the linear piecewise spline into a lower dimensional function such as a polynomial spline with dirac delta endpoints if the rmse of the projection is above threshold we leave the spline alone in the high resolution piecewise linear mode this allows us to debug the spline model for features that are buggy or unexpectedly complex e g jumping up and down when we expect some kind of smoothness boosted stumps model small compact model not very interpretable but at small sizes useful for feature selection decision tree model in memory only mostly used to generate transforms for the linear or spline model maxout neural network model experimental and mostly used as a comparison baseline if you use intellij try build first so that thrift classes is available and to fix the spark compiling error inside intellij type command and and click dependency and change related files from test to compile such as org apache spark and org apache hadoop hadoop common we keep gradle config as testcompile so that to reduce jar file size in the wild organizations and

7147058, the core library sets up the presentation javascript  provides a simple control api control api and manages events events any other functionality is implemented as a plugin plugins npm install g generator bespoke yo bespoke in your newly scaffolded project you can use the following gulp tasks gulp serve to run a preview server with livereload gulp deploy to deploy to github pages gulp to compile static assets to public it s completely up to you which tags you use but the following is a good starting point section slide  and section section slide  and section section slide  and section and article to create a new presentation bespoke js provides the from selector  plugins method which takes a selector or element reference and an array of plugins plugins  and returns a deck instance deck instances var deck bespoke from presentation  plugins and and next slide deck next and and previous slide deck prev and and go to a specific slide deck slide  and and get the active slide index deck slide and and  by default all non script child elements of the resolved parent element become slides you can customize this behavior by passing a custom selector all official plugins can be installed from npm or bower e g npm install bespoke keys or bower install bespoke touch var bespoke require bespoke  classes require bespoke classes  keys require bespoke keys  touch require bespoke touch var deck bespoke from presentation  classes  keys  touch if you re using browser globals all official plugins are added to the bespoke plugins object for example var deck bespoke from presentation  bespoke plugins classes  bespoke plugins keys  bespoke plugins touch the first slide is activated automatically after all plugins are called unless one of those plugins has already activated a slide as with plugins all official themes can be installed from npm or bower e g npm install bespoke theme cube or bower install bespoke theme voltaire themes are included just like any other plugin var bespoke require bespoke  cube require bespoke theme cube  keys require bespoke keys  touch require bespoke touch var deck bespoke from presentation  cube  keys  touch if you re using browser globals all official themes are added to the bespoke themes object for example var deck bespoke from presentation  bespoke themes cube  bespoke plugins keys  bespoke plugins touch if you already have a reference to a dom node you can pass it directly to the from method bespoke from element you can specify which elements become slides by passing an options hash containing the key parent and optionally the key slides to the from method the value of either key can be a css selector or a dom node bespoke from parent selectororelement slides selectororelementlist for example bespoke from parent presentation  slides presentation section this advanced usage allows you to include auxiliary html inside the parent element skip slides that don t match the selector or explicitly filter out slides before passing on the collection deck instances are provided to plugins and returned when instantiating a presentation the following properties are available on each instance note the optional eventdata custom event data parameter is an object that will be merged with the event object in subsequent event handlers events events are bound via the deck instance deck instances each event is passed an event object containing a reference to the relevant slide and its index deck on eventname function event event slide and and relevant slide event index and and index of relevant slide and and prevent default functionality for deck interaction events only return false in most cases you will only need to use these standard events these events are fired when the deck has been interacted with but before the interaction has had any effect this allows you to intercept the default behaviour by returning false from the event handler when binding events the on method returns a function that can be used to remove the event handler var off deck on activate  function and and unbind event you can also use the off method however you must use the same function reference that was used when registering the event and and bind event deck on activate  onactivate and and unbind event deck off activate  onactivate if you d like to learn by example check out the list of existing plugins plugins plugins are simply functions that are called when presentations are created they are passed a deck instance deck instances which allows you to interact with the deck s state bind events and modify its elements to be consistent with the suite of official bespoke js plugins it is highly recommended that you implement your plugin as a function that takes configuration and returns a plugin function and and creating the plugin var myplugin function return function deck on activate  function e console log activated slide and e index and  and of and deck slides length the plugin can now be provided in the plugins array when using the from selector  plugins method and and using the plugin bespoke from presentation  myplugin if your plugin needs some configurability your plugin factory function can take options and return a configured plugin function and and creating the plugin with options var myplugin function options return function deck var showtotal options options showtotal deck on activate  function e console log activated slide and e index and  and showtotal of and deck slides length and and using the plugin with options bespoke from presentation  myplugin showtotal true additional event data can be supplied to next  prev and slide  which is merged with the final event object in subsequent event handlers this functionality is particularly useful if you need to differentiate between events caused by your plugin and those caused by your end users or other plugins var myplugin function return function deck and and differentiating our plugin s events deck on activate  function event if event foo bar and and triggered by my plugin else and and triggered by end user or another plugin and and providing custom event data deck next foo bar themes are essentially just plugins that also happen to insert styles into the page

3932983, retina js makes it easy to serve high resolution images to devices with displays that support them you can prepare images for as many levels of pixel density as you want and let retina js dynamically serve the right image to the user there are  ways to use retina js  automatically swapping out src paths on img tags  automatically swapping out background image urls in inline styles  manually specifying the location of a high res image variant works for src attributes and inline styles  automatically creating media queries for css background images retina js assumes you are using apple s prescribed high resolution modifiers x x etc to denote high res image variants on your server it also assumes that if you have prepared a variant for a given high res environment that you have also prepared variants for each environment below it for example if you have prepared x variants retina js will assume that you have also prepared x variants with this in mind you ll specify your highest environment level with the data rjs attribute and let retina js take it from there let s say you have an image on your page that looks like this in this case we ve set our resolution cap at   denoting that we ve prepared x and x image variants when the page loads retina js will check the actual resolution of the device environment to decide whether it should really serve up a x image if the user happens to be in a x environment retina js will serve up the x image instead assuming it will find the image at and images and myimage x png if the environment does have x capabilities retina js will serve up the x image it will expect that url to be and images and myimage x png if the environment has the ability to display images at higher densities than x retina js will serve up the image of the highest resolution that you ve provided in this case x previous versions of retina js were unable to target background images set via inline styles now if you apply a data rjs attribute to any kind of element other than an img  the script will target inline background images instead of src attributes so if you created an element like this retina js would convert it to something like this the logic behind image swapping is exactly the same when dealing with background images as it is when dealing with src attributes if the user s environment only supports x variants retina js will load the x variant instead of the x note that it is up to you in a case like this to correctly apply background sizing and any other necessary background related styles to the element retina js will not affect these  in previous versions you could tell the script where to find your high res file by using the data atx attribute now if you pass a url to the data rjs attribute retina js will use the image at the path you specify for all high resolution environments instead of trying to dynamically serve an auto suffixed image path based on the environment s capabilities this will work for both src attributes on img tags and inline background images on all other tags for example you might write something like this style background url and images and myimage png data rjs and images and x and my image png if the user then loads the page in any kind of high resolution environment they ll get the following style background url and images and x and my image png data rjs and images and x and my image png retina js comes with mixins for scss sass less and stylus these mixins work similarly to the javascript version in that they will dynamically serve images for as many high res environments as you ve prepared image variants for previously these mixins were named atx but because they now serve images for multiple environments they have been renamed retina in each language the retina mixin allows  parameters  path the path to your standard resolution image  cap optional  the highest resolution level for which you have prepared images defaults to   size optional  a value to be applied to the background size property defaults to auto auto  extras optional  any other values to be added to the background property defaults to nothing here is an example wherein we are specifying that we have prepared images for both x and x environments include retina and images and myimage png   cover center center no repeat and retina and images and myimage png   cover center center no repeat retina and images and myimage png   cover center center no repeat stylus stylus retina and images and myimage png   cover center center no repeat regardless of the dialect the output is effectively the same background url and images and myimage png center center no repeat background size cover media all and webkit min device pixel ratio    all and o min device pixel ratio  and   all and min moz device pixel ratio    all and min device pixel ratio   item background url and images and myimage x png center center no repeat background size cover media webkit min device pixel ratio   min resolution dpi item background url and images and myimage x png center center no repeat background size cover media webkit min device pixel ratio   min resolution dpi item background url and images and myimage x png center center no repeat background size cover retina js is compatible with all modern browsers and should not throw errors in old browsers all the way back through ie there are  ways to use the javascript version of retina js  the old school way manually dropping the script into an html file  the new school way importing it into a larger javascript build process to use retina js the old school way download retina min js and put it on your server then include the script in your html file at the bottom of your template before your closing and body tag using this technique retina js will run automatically on page load it will also create a globally available function called retinajs whenever you d like to manually re initialize the script simply call window retinajs if you don t pass any arguments to the retinajs function it will only attempt to process images that have not previously been processed by the script optionally you can pass a collection of html elements to the script in which case it will only attempt to process elements in that collection specifically the ones that have not been processed before your collection may take the form of an array nodelist or jquery selection javascript retinajs and and finds all images not previously processed and processes them retinajs img img img and and only attempts to process the images in the collection retinajs img retinajs document queryselectorall img to use retina js the new school way you ll want to require it or import it if you re using es into your gulp and webpack and grunt and commonjs and etc application in this case the script won t run automatically instead it ll let you determine when you d like it to run javascript import retina from retina window addeventlistener load  retina notice that the retina function can be called as often as you need in order to re initialize the image swapping if you don t pass any arguments to the retina function it will only attempt to process images that have not previously been processed by the script optionally you can pass a collection of html elements to the script in which case it will only attempt to process elements in that collection specifically the ones that have not been processed before your collection may take the form of an array nodelist or jquery selection javascript retina and and finds all images not previously processed and processes them retina img img img and and only attempts to process the images in the collection retina img retina document queryselectorall img the process for including the css mixins is relatively straightforward here is a breakdown for each add the mixin retina mixin from retina scss to your scss stylesheet or reference it in an import in your stylesheet call the mixin using include retina anywhere instead of using background or background image add the retina mixin from retina sass to your sass stylesheet or reference it in an import in your stylesheet call the mixin using and retina anywhere instead of using background or background image add the retina mixin from retina less to your less stylesheet or reference it in an import in your stylesheet call the mixin using retina anywhere instead of using background or background image add the retina mixin from retina styl to your stylus stylesheet or reference it in an import in your stylesheet call the mixin using retina anywhere instead of using background or background image or any framework that embeds some digest and hash to the asset urls based on the contents e g and images and image hash jpg the problem with this is that the high resolution version would have a different hash and would not conform to the usual pattern i e and images and image x hash jpg so automatic detection would fail because retina js would check the existence of and images and image hash x jpg there s no way for retina js to know beforehand what the high resolution image s hash would be without some sort of help from the server side so in this case there are a couple of options for handling it although it s not quite as fancy as dynamically serving up files based on the resolution of the user s environment this may be a good time to pass a url string to the data rjs attribute so that you can manually tell retina js exactly where to look for a high resolution variant of your image

21748166, smoothstate js  built with smoothstate js built with smoothstatejs need help need help intro intro options options methods and properties methods and properties faq faq contribute contribute if you need a little help implementing smoothstate there are a couple things you could do to get some support please avoid creating a github issue with personal support requests to keep the tracker clear for bugs and pull requests imagine for a second how disorienting it would be if touching a doorknob teleported you to the other side of the door navigating the web feels like using a teleporting doorknob layouts change elements rearrange or disappear and it takes time for the user to adjust smooth transitions reduce the effort it takes for users to get settled into a new environment javascript spa frameworks sometimes referred to as mvc frameworks are a common way to solve this issue these frameworks often lose the benefits of unobtrusive code writing unobtrusive javascript gives us more resilience to errors and improved performance and accessibility smoothstate js provides hooks that can be used to choreograph how elements enter and exit the page during navigation it uses the time the animations are running to fetch content via ajax to inject into the page the project s main goal is to allow developers to add page transitions without having to add any logic to the backend we keep things unobtrusive at all times smoothstate js initializes on containers not links think of a container as a small window object embedded in the page  every url on your site should return a full layout not just an html fragment  the smoothstate container needs to have an id set a unique hook to tell us what to update on the page  all links and forms on the page should live within the container these requirements makes the website resilient since it smoothstate js can abort and simply redirect the user if an error occurs making each link return a full page also ensures that pages are created with progressive enhancement in mind all we need to do to get started is  include a copy of jquery and jquery smoothstate js on your page  add a container with an id of main and include some links inside of it  create a new js file and run main smoothstate function main smoothstate by default smoothstate js will prevent links and forms from triggering a full page load if possible use ajax to request pages and replace the content appropriately update urls and browsing history so that browsing expectations aren t broken smoothstate js will not add page transitions to pages you ll need to define the animations you want to run using the hooks smoothstate js provides onbefore onbefore runs before a page load has been started onstart onstart runs once a page load has been activated onprogress onprogress runs if the page request is still pending and the onstart animations have finished onready onready run once the requested content is ready to be injected into the page and the previous animations have finished onafter onafter runs after the new content has been injected into the page and all animations are complete smoothstate js provides some options that allow customization of the plugin s functionality the default options are overridden by passing an object into the smoothstate function function use strict var options prefetch true cachelength  onstart

html newcontent smoothstate main smoothstate options data smoothstate if set to true  smoothstate js will log useful debug information to the console instead of aborting for example instead of

17996971, build status image travis pypi version pypi augmented traffic control atc is a tool to simulate network conditions it allows controlling the connection that a device has to the internet developers can use atc to test their application across varying network conditions easily emulating high speed mobile and even severely impaired networks aspects of the connection that can be controlled include bandwidth latency packet loss corrupted packets packets ordering in order to be able to shape the network traffic atc must be running on a device that routes the traffic and sees the real ip address of the device like your network gateway for instance this also allows any devices that route through atc to be able to shape their traffic traffic can be shaped and unshaped using a web interface allowing any devices with a web browser to use atc without the need for a client application atc is made of multiple components that interact together django atc demo ui atc and django atc demo ui a django app that provides a simple web ui to use atc from a mobile phone django atc profile storage atc and django atc profile storage a django app that can be used to save shaping profiles making it easier to re use them later without manually re entering those settings by splitting atc in sub components it make it easier to hack on it or build on top of it while django atc demo ui is shipped as part of atc s main repository to allow people to be able to use atc out of the box by providing a rest api to atcd  it makes it relatively easy to interact with atcd via the command line and opens the path for the community to be able to build creative command line tools web ui or mobile apps that interact with atc atc architecture atcarchitecture python   currently atc is only supported on python version   django   currently atc is only supported using django version   the fact that atc is splitted in multiple packages allows for multiple deployment scenarii however deploying all the packages on the same host is the simplest and most likely fitting most use cases to get more details on how to install and configure each packages please refer to the packages respective readmes the easiest way to install atc is by using pip pip install atcthrift atcd django atc api django atc demo ui django atc profile storage now that we have all the packages installed we need to create a new django project in which we will use our django app django admin startproject atcui now that we have our django project we need to configure it to use our apps and we need to tell it how to route to our apps open atcui and settings py and enable the atc apps by adding to installedapps python installedapps django atc api restframework  atcapi  django atc demo ui bootstrapthemes  djangostaticjquery  atcdemoui  django atc profile storage atcprofilestorage  now open atcui and urls py and enable routing to the atc apps by adding the routes to urlpatterns python from django views generic base import redirectview from django conf urls import include urlpatterns django atc api url r api and v and  include atcapi urls  django atc demo ui url r atcdemoui and  include atcdemoui urls  django atc profile storage url r api and v and profiles and  include atcprofilestorage urls  url r  redirectview asview url and atcdemoui and  permanent false  finally let s update the django db python manage py migrate all require packages should now be installed and configured we now need to run the daemon and the ui interface while we will run atc straight from the command line in this example you can refer to example sysvinit chef and atc and files and default and init d and upstart chef and atc and templates and default and upstart scripts atcd modifies network related settings and as such needs to run in privileged mode sudo atcd supposing eth is your interface to connect to the internet and eth  your interface to connect to your lan this should just work if your setting is slightly different use the command line arguments atcd wan and atcd lan to adapt to your configuration the ui on the other hand is a standard django web app and can be run as a normal user make sure you are in the directory that was created when you ran django admin startproject atcui and run python manage py runserver      atc source code is available under the atc atc and directory it is currently composed of atcthrift atc and atcthrift the thrift interface s library atcd atc and atcd the atc daemon that runs on the router doing the traffic shaping django atc api atc and django atc api a django app that provides a restful interface to atcd django atc demo ui atc and django atc demo ui a django app that provides a simple demo ui leveraging the restful api django atc profile storage atc and django atc profile storage a django app that allows saving shaping profiles to db allowing users to select their favorite profile from a list instead of re entering all the profile details every time the chef chef and directory contains  chef cookbooks atc chef and atc and a cookbook to deploy atc it also allows to deploy atc in a virtual box vm in order to develop on atc atclient chef and atcclient set up a linux desktop vm that can be used to test shaping end to end atcthrift defines the thrift interface to communicate with the atcd daemon django atc api is a django app that provide a rest api to the atcd daemon web applications command line tools can use the api in order to shape and unshape traffic django atc profile storage allows saving profiles to db a typical use case will be to save a list of predefined and often used shaping settings that you want to be able to accessing in just a few clicks and taps to make atc development easier we use virtual box and vagrant to provision and run a vm that will run the atc daemon and the atc ui from your git checkout interacting with atc will only shape the traffic within the vm and not on the host note vagrant is an easy way to set up a test environment but virtualization will produce different results than a setup on bare metal we recommend using vagrant only for testing and development and using bare metal for setups which require realistic shaping settings you will need to install virtualbox vagrant and a couple of plugins install some vagrant plugins vagrant plugin install vagrant berkshelf plugin version    vagrant plugin install vagrant omnibus clone this repo git clone git github com facebook and augmented traffic control git atc once in the repo go to the chef and atc directory and run vagrant up trusty this will take some time before it completes once the vm is provision ssh into it vagrant ssh trusty once you ve got atc up and running you can run the script utils and restore profiles sh to setup the set of default profiles the script needs to be passed a hostname port with the location of your atc instance utils and restore profiles sh localhost  after doing this you should see the  sample profiles listed below in your atc instance g developing rural g developing urban g average g good cable edge average edge good edge lossy no connectivity naturally you cannot improve your natural network speed by selecting a faster profile than your service for example selecting the cable profile will not make your network faster if your natural connection speed resembles dsl more closely hacking on atc is done from the host and tested in the vm in order to reflect the changes you will need to start the services manually both atcd and atcui have their python libraries installed in a python virtualenv so you will need to activate the environment in order to be able to run the services the virtualenv is installed in and usr and local and atc and venv and bin and activate source and usr and local and atc and venv and bin and activate the atcd daemon is running under the root user privileges all operations below needs to be done as root to run the daemon manually first make sure it is not running in the background service atcd stop and run the daemon once you are happy with your changes and you want to test them you will need to kill the daemon and restart it in order to apply the changes this is a django project and when running the django built in http server will detect code changes and reload automatically to run the http rest api and ui cd and var and django python manage py runserver

97027254, this tutorial tries to do what most most machine learning tutorials available online do not it is not a  minute tutorial which teaches you how to train your own neural network or learn deep learning in under  minutes it s a full pipeline which you would need to do if you actually work with machine learning introducing you to all the parts and all the implementation decisions and details that need to be made the dataset is not one of the standard sets like mnist or cifar you will make you very own dataset then you will go through a couple conventional machine learning algorithms before finally getting to deep learning in the fall of  i was a teaching fellow harvard s version of ta for the graduate class on advanced topics in data science cs and  at harvard university i was in charge of designing the class project given to the students and this tutorial has been built on top of the project i designed for the class if you would like to use this work please cite the work using the doi if you would like to access to code please go through the ipython notebook deeplearningproject ipynb we will be using python   primary reason is that tensorflow is not compatible with python   and some other libraries are not compatible with python  to make setup easy we are going to use conda the repository has a conda config file which will make setting up super easy it s the file deeplearningprojectenvironment yml then create a new conda environment using the command with conda env create f deeplearningprojectenvironment yml now you can activate the environment with source activate deeplearningproject jupyter notebook if all the isntallations go through you are good to go if not here is a list of packages that need to be installed requests imdbpy wget tmdbsimple seaborn sklearn pillow keras tensorflow hpy gensim nltk stopwords please install imdbpy using pip install imdbpy   since earlier versions are broken to be able to run the environment you just created on a juputer notebook first check that you have the python package ipykernel installed if you don t simply install it using pip install ipykernel now add this to your jupyter notebook using the command python m ipykernel install user name deeplearningproject display name deeplearningproject needless to say remove all single quotes before running commands go to the directory and run jupyter notbeook by jupyter notebook and open the respective notebook on browser to install tmdb pip install tmdbsimple use import tmdbsimple as tmdb to work with an isolate environment and be able to run it on many systems without troubles you can run this docker compose command docker compose up it will build deeplearningproject image according to dockerfile and then run dokcer container via docker compose see docker and docker compose docs for more informations you should notice that notebooks have been copied from root to notebooks folder to mount them into container via bind volume any changes you make will be saved on host notebooks dir you can add conda or pip packages to image and thus container by updating deeplearningprojectenvironment yml file and then run docker compose build it will build a new deeplearningproject image with new conda and pip packages installed stop your running container ctrl c and then docker compose up to rerun a fresh new container i will keep updating this as issues pop up on this repository one known bug is because keras   is not compatible with some keras   functionalities you may run into errors with importing vgg if so just update keras using the following command sudo pip install git and git and and github com and fchollet and keras git upgrade os error too many open files or shut down notebook and execute following the the same terminal ulimit sn  and restart the jupyter notebook hope this repo helps introduce you to a full machine learning pipeline if you spot an error please create an issue to help out others using this resource to prevent problems with installation and setting up this repository comes with a conda environment profile the only thing you will need is to install the newest version of conda and use this profile to create a new environment and it will come set up with all the libraries you will need for the tutorial

14386080, introducing b jbchartview and b jawbone s ios based charting library for both line and bar graphs it is easy to set up and highly customizable drop in uiview subclass supported across all devices line and bar graph support simple to use protocols modeled after a uitableview highly customizable expand collapse animation support requires ios  or later requires automatic reference counting arc build and run the i jbchartviewdemo and i project in xcode the demo demonstrates the use of both the line and bar charts it also outlines how a chart s appearance can be customized simply add the following line to your code podfile and code platform ios   pod jbchartview the simplest way to use jbchartview with your application is to drag and drop the i and classes and i folder into you re xcode  project it s also recommended you rename the i and classes and i folder to something more descriptive ie i jawbone jbchartview and i and center all jbchartview implementations have a similiar data source and delgate pattern to i uitableview and i if you re familiar with using a i uitableview and i or i uitableviewcontroller and i  using a jbchartview subclass should be a breeze to use jbcartview in a swift project add the following to your bridging header jbchartview bridging header h import uikit and uikit h import jbchartview h import jbbarchartview h import jblinechartview h to initialize a i jbbarchartview and i  you only need a few lines of code see below bar charts can also be initialized via a b nib and b or with a b frame and b jbbarchartview barchartview jbbarchartview alloc init barchartview datasource self barchartview delegate self self addsubview barchartview just like you would for a uitableview  ensure you clear these properties in your dealloc void dealloc jbbarchartview barchartview and and i e barchartview barchartview delegate nil barchartview datasource nil at a minimum you need to inform the data source how many bars are in the chart nsuinteger numberofbarsinbarchartview jbbarchartview barchartview return and and number of bars in chart secondly you need to inform the delegate the height of each bar automatically normalized across the entire chart cgfloat barchartview jbbarchartview barchartview heightforbarviewatindex nsuinteger index return and and height of bar at index lastly ensure you have set the frame of your barchartview call reloaddata at least once barchartview frame cgrectmake barchartview reloaddata subsequent changes to the chart s frame will not invoke reloaddata it must be called directly afterwards for any changes to take effect void reloaddataanimated bool animated state changes during a reload will be ignored as well subsequent calls to reloaddata or reloaddataanimated before any previous reloads are complete will also be ignored lastly all touch events will be ignored until a reload has completed you can always check on the state of the animation via the exposed read only property property nonatomic readonly bool reloading by default the animation will complete in approximately   seconds the animation duration is independent from the data model size note the above restrictions apply only to animated reloads as non animated reloads are synchronous similiarily to initialize a jblinechartview you only need a few lines of code see below line charts can also be initialized via a b nib and b or with a b frame and b jblinechartview linechartview jblinechartview alloc init linechartview datasource self linechartview delegate self self addsubview linechartview just like you would for a uitableview  ensure you clear these properties in your dealloc void dealloc jblinechartview linechartview and and i e linechartview linechartview delegate nil linechartview

linechartview verticalvalueforhorizontalindex nsuinteger horizontalindex atlineindex nsuinteger lineindex return and and y position y axis of point at horizontalindex x axis note you can return nan instead of cgfloat to indicate missing values the chart s line will begin at the first non nan value and end at the last non nan value the line will interopolate any nan values in between ie the line will not be interrupted return nsnumber numberwithfloat nan floatvalue lastly ensure you have set the frame of your linechartview call reloaddata at least once linechartview frame cgrectmake linechartview reloaddata note subsequent changes to the chart s frame will not invoke reloaddata it must be called directly afterwards for any changes to take effect by default a chart s minimum and maximum values are equal to the min and max supplied by the datasource you can override either value via void setminimumvalue cgfloat minimumvalue void setmaximumvalue cgfloat maximumvalue if value s are supplied they must be  otherwise an assertion will be thrown to reset the values back to their original defaults void resetminimumvalue void resetmaximumvalue the min and max values are clamped to the ceiling and floor of the actual min and max values of the chart s data source for example if a maximumvalue of  is supplied the chart s actual max is  then  will be used for min and max modifications to take effect reloaddata must be called the nature of charting is to display all available information unlike a uitableview which can cache rows that are offscreen jbchartview s performance will suffer if the number of data points exceed the resolution of the device the same issue exists with mkmapview when hundreds of pins are supplied within a certain geographic area it s why apple recommends clustering to avoid performance issues as such for large datasets we recommend that your datasource to supply a subset of points clustering those that are close to one another

errors console c redirect console logs to terminal index i specify a different index html file poll p enable polling when watch is given show s show the browser window default false headless h do not open the devtools window timeout t if specified will close after x seconds break insert a breakpoint in entry point config a path to devtoolrc config file verbose verbose chromium logging version v log versions of underlying tools require r require path s before running entry browser field bf resolve using browser field no source maps no sm disable source map generation no node timers no nt use browser timers no browser globals no bg removes windowdocumentnavigator from required files examples devtool src and index js index index html watch devtool main js q c foo txt devtool writer js readme md devtool app js watch entry devtool r babel register app js you can specify watch multiple times to watch different files and globs if a custom index is passed it will also be watched for changes if is given anything after it will be used as the arguments for the app s process argv this way you can avoid polluting your program arguments with those specific to devtool the no browser globals or no bg flag makes required modules behave a little more like node in that window  navigator  document and some other browser globals will be undefined in required files note the console and repl may still show some of these globals you can also specify advanced electron and node options in a rc configuration file such as devtools themes and v flags see rc configuration and docs and rc config md for more details and and build js var browserify require browserify and and start devtools profiling console profile build and and bundle some browser application browserify client js bundle function err src if err throw err and and finish devtools profiling console profileend build now we can run devtool on our file devtool build js some screenshots of the profiling and debugging experience note performance may vary between node and electron so always take the results with a grain of salt you can also set an initial breakpoint with the break flag this will insert a debugger statement hidden behind source maps at the start of your entry file this way you can add breakpoints without having to reload the program or manually add them to your source code devtool src and index js break we can also use the devtools console as a basic node repl with some nice additional features the require statements will be relative to your current working directory you can run the command without any entry file like this when you don t specify an entry file you can pipe javascript in to execute it in the browser for example browserify client js and devtool c devtool street js index street html quit bf street png note for the output to drain correctly we need to close the window after the buffer has been written process stdout write buffer function window close to debug grunt and gulp and mocha and other commands you will need to pass the javascript file that runs them you should also include to avoid any argument conflicts devtool nodemodules and gulp and bin and gulp js c watch devtool nodemodules and grunt cli and bin and grunt c devtool nodemodules and mocha and bin and mocha qc and tests and my spec js see the example and and example and folder for more ideas and the package json and package json scripts which run them it also includes some additional features on top of electron improved error handling more detailed syntax errors in console improved source map support for required files console redirection back to terminal optional file watching for development and quit on error flags for unit testing e g continuous integration handles process exit and error codes supports browser field resolution optional can hide browser globals like window and navigator for better compatibility with node js modules optional supports config files for v flags color themes and other options since this is running in electron and chromium instead of node you might run into some oddities and gotchas window and other browser apis are present this may affect modules using these globals to detect browser and node environments the no browser globals may help mitigate these issues you must call window close to stop the process apps will not quit on their own if you want to close or exit after writing to stderr and stdout you should do so after a callback outstream write buf callback this project is experimental and has not been tested on a wide range of applications or node and os environments if you want to help please open an issue or submit a pr some outstanding areas to explore improving syntax error handling e g adding it to sources panel exposing an api for programmatic usage exploring native addons testing against a wide range of node js applications and modules you can git clone and npm install this repo to start working from source type npm run to list all available commands in some ways devtool is a spiritual successor to hihat the architecture is cleaner and better suited for large node and electron applications whereas devtool is more focused on the command line unix style piping and redirection and electron and browser apis for interesting use cases e g google streetview browser apis devtool shims various features to behave more like node js like require main and process exit and overrides the internal require mechanism for source maps improved error handling and browser field resolution this means your code will run in a true node environment without any window or other browser and electron apis that may pollute scope and cause problems with certain modules it has stronger support for large node js applications i e native addons and more control over the devtools instance i e can inject breakpoints and support network requests however since it re implements much of the debugging experience it may feel clunky and fragile compared to developing inside the latest chrome devtools e g console profile does not exist whereas devtool aims to make the experience feel more familiar to those coming

some of these features in the objective c demo resources and features testing png  get the component import the header import tlyshynavbar and tlyshynavbarmanager h import the header import tlyshynavbar and tlyshynavbar h import the header import tlyshynavbarmanager h  write one line of code to get started and in your uiviewcontroller viewdidload or after creating the scroll view and self shynavbarmanager scrollview self scrollview important notes  don t use with uitableviewcontroller add a uitableview as a subview of uiviewcontroller instead  if you are assigning a delegate to your scrollview do that before assigning the scrollview to the tlyshynavbarmanager to learn more see below how it works then you should be able to follow the objective c instructions since the code is almost identical and ease of use this is the most important and should never be compromised even if compatability breaks or versatility is limited the component should remain easy to integrate and portable less dependencies lightweight self contained etc and compatability whenever possible the component should simply work with whatever you throw at it the above example while small is complete it makes the navigation bar enriched with humility that it will start getting out of the way when the scroll view starts scrolling but you may want to do more than that simply access it within your uiviewcontroller subclass as a property the property is lazy loaded for you so you don t have to instantiate anything self shynavbarmanager you can assign your own extension view and it will appear right beneath the navigation bar it will slide beneath the navigation bar before the navigation bar starts shrinking contracting adding an extension view is as simple as and also in your uiviewcontroller subclass and self shynavbarmanager setextensionview self toolbar to stick the extension view to the top and have it remain visible when the navigation bar has been hidden and also in your uiviewcontroller subclass and self shynavbarmanager setstickyextensionview yes when you starting scrolling up going down the view or scrolling down going up the view  you may want the navigation bar to hold off for a certain amount tolerance before changing states i e if the user scrolls down  px don t immediately start showing the contracted navigation bar but wait till he scrolls say  px you can control that using the following properties on the shynavbarmanager and control the resistance when scrolling up and down before the navbar expands and contracts again property nonatomic cgfloat expansionresistance and and default  property nonatomic cgfloat contractionresistance and and default  you can customize the fade behavior of the uinavigationbar through this property and choose how the navbar fades as it contracts and expands defaults to fadesubviews property nonatomic tlyshynavbarfade fadebehavior ok i ll admit that i added this section purely to rant about how this project came together and the decision making process behind it at a component user level this works by adding a category to uiviewcontroller with a tlyshynavbarmanager property the property is lazily loaded to cut any unnecessary overhead and lower the barrier of entry from the property you can start customizing the tlyshynavbarmanager for that view controller now you may start asking what about the navigation bar well the navigation bar is accessed from the view controller your using the manager in let s break that down  when you access the shynavbarmanager for the first time it is created with the self parameter passed to it effectively binding the shynavbarmanager to the uiviewcontroller  the shynavbarmanager accesses the uinavigationbar through the assigned uiviewcontroller and that is how the basic setup is done when you call setextensionview  it simply resizes an internal container view and adds your extension view to it there is no magic here just simple single view extension this one was a pain first the experiments that this project went through included and observing the contentoffset property and adding self as a uigesturerecognizer target and adding a uipangesturerecognizer to the scroll view and make the user implement uiscrollviewdelegate  and send us the events the above didn t yield the perfect experience we were hoping for except the last one it did however make for redundant code everywhere and forced the component user to implement the uiscrollviewdelegate that s when the nsproxy happened when you assign the scrollview property to the tlyshynavbarmanager we attach a proxy object to the uiscrollview as the delegate and then the original delegate to that proxy the proxy forwards the events we are interested in to the tlyshynavbarmanager  and of course does everything else normally for the original selector you won t even notice a thing the way the offsets are applied to the navigation bar and extension view is through an elegant doubly linked list implementation we set the offset to the first node navigation bar  and and if it is contracting we pass the contraction amount to the next node and it returns a residual amount and if we are expanding we process the offset in the first node and pass the residual to the next node it is a simple concept say we dragged down by  px while the navbar was contracted the navigation bar would take  px of that to expand and then pass the residual  px to the next node extension view to calculate its offset the same goes for contracting but it starts from the last node all the way up to the navigation bar we also add a parent relationship for a single purpose make the child follow its parent s offset so if the parent e g navigation bar is scrolling away to the top we make sure the child accommodates the parent s offset in the calculation so it appears as if the child is a subview of the parent note even though there might be an illusion that the views are expanding and contracting it s really just a translation scrolling of the views there might be an advantage to actually resizing the bounds so the extension view doesn t appear behind the navigation bar for example so that approach might be explored in the future you have to check the  extend edges under opaque bars in the view controller configuration credit for this solution goes to tiois there are downsides in making this component as easy to use as it is if you have read the how it works section carefully you d realize that trying to configure the the shynavbarmanager before it is included in the uinavigationcontroller hierarchy will break the component since within the component we cannot find the navigation bar and an assert is triggered nsassert navbar nil please make sure the viewcontroller is already attached to a navigation controller of course that can be avoided by creating your own tlyshynavbarmanager  like so tlyshynavbarmanager shymanager tlyshynavbarmanager new shymanager expansionresistance  f and sometime after the view controller is added to the hierarchy and viewcontroller shynavbarmanager shymanager prs are welcome it is important to test changes though simply go over the demo make sure nothing is broken please do check both translucent and opaque modes once all is good you re good to go if it is a feature or bug it would be greatly appreciated if a new view is added to the demo project demonstrating the bug and feature

project is unmaintained i consider it an interesting experiment but i have no intention to keep updating the benchmark results with every new browser release or to add new features i invite folks to keep using it but to be aware that they should heavily benchmark their own websites to ensure it s actually a significant performance improvement in their target browsers  npm install g optimize js

function console log wrap me you can also pass in arguments var optimizejs require optimize js var input function console log wrap me var output optimizejs input sourcemap true and and now the output has source maps modern javascript engines like v chakra and spidermonkey have a heuristic where they pre parse most functions before doing a full parse the pre parse step merely checks for syntax errors while avoiding the cost of a full parse this heuristic is based on the assumption that on the average web page most javascript functions are never executed or are lazily executed so a pre parse can prevent a slower startup time by only checking for what the browser absolutely needs to know about the function i e whether it s syntactically well formed or not unfortunately this assumption breaks down in the case of immediately invoked function expressions iifes  such as these function console log executed function console log executed crockford style function console log executed uglifyjs style the good news is that js engines have a further optimization where they try to detect such iifes and skip the pre parse step hooray the bad news though is that these heuristics don t always work because they re based on a greedy method of checking for a token immediately to the left of the function the parser avoids anything more intricate because it would amount to parsing the whole thing negating the benefit of the pre parse in cases without the paren which include common module formats like umd and browserify and webpack and etc  the browser will actually parse the function twice first as a pre parse and second luckily because the optimization for iifes is so well established we can exploit this during our build process by parsing the entire javascript file in advance a luxury the browser can t afford and inserting parentheses in the cases where we know the function will be immediately executed or where we have a good hunch that s what optimize js does the current implementation is to parse to a syntax tree and check for functions that  are immediately invoked via any kind of call statement function  function  etc  are passed in directly as arguments to another function the first method is an easy win  those functions are immediately executed the second method is more of a heuristic but tends to be a safe bet given common patterns like node style errbacks promise chains and umd and browserify and webpack module declarations in all such cases optimize js wraps the function in parentheses yes optimize js might add as many as two bytes horror per function which amounts to practically nil once you take gzip into account to prove it here are the gzipped sizes for the libraries i use in the benchmark and script and size bytes and difference bytes

eagerly invoked functions it may actually hurt your performance in some cases see benchmarks below for examples be sure to check that optimize js is a help rather than a hindrance for your particular codebase using something like var start performance now and script var end performance now console log took and end start and ms and script note that the script boundaries are actually recommended in order to truly measure the full parse and compile time which allows you to easily set mark and measure points that you can visually inspect in the dev tools timeline to ensure that the full compile time is being measured possibly this is a free and open source library so i encourage anybody to borrow the code or the good ideas as described above the pre parsing optimization in browsers is a very good idea for the vast majority of the web where most functions aren t immediately executed however since optimize js knows when your functions are immediately executed or can make reasonable guesses  it can be more judicious in applying the paren hack based on my tests this optimization seems to work best for v chrome  followed by chakra edge  followed by spidermonkey firefox for javascriptcore safari it seems to be basically a wash and may actually be a slight regression overall depending on your codebase again this is why it s important to actually measure on your own codebase on the

configuration system configuration usage usage suitable scenarios suitable scenarios how to use how to use demo server demo server evaluation evaluation nginx nginx haproxy haproxy online evaluation online evaluation new features new features contacts contacts asplos  with a rapid growth of nic bandwidth and cpu cores on one single machine a scalable tcp network stack is performance critical however stock linux kernel does not scale well when cpu core number is above  it is even worse that the throughput could collapse when there are more than  cpu cores fastsocket is a scalable kernel tcp socket implementation and achieves a straight linear performance growth when scaling up to  cpu cores meanwhile the underlying kernel optimization of fastsocket is transparent for socket applications which means existing applications can take advantage of fastsocket without changing their codes currently fastsocket is implemented in the linux kernel kernel       el x of centos   which is the latest version of redhat el since centos   is our major production environment system according to our evaluations fastsocket increases throughput of nginx and haproxy measured by connections per second by  and  on a  core machine compared to the base centos   kernel moreover fastsocket can further exploit more from the hardware with fastsocket hyper threading can make an extra  performance increase with fastsocket nic that support flow director like intel  can increase the throughput by  if the server works as a proxy like haproxy fastsocket v  has already been deployed in the sina production environment fastsocket is used with haproxy to provide http load balance service and has been running stably since march  more details are in the evaluation online evaluation fastsocket is released under gplv and we promise that we would never ask for any payment to use our codes fastsocket is started and mainly developed by xiaofeng lin from the os team of sina com os center of tsinghua is cooperating closely with sina com to further enhance fastsocket fastsocket is also supported by intel with extensive assistance zeuux community is providing open source consulting for fastsocket here is a brief introduction to the directories in the repository kernel source code of the fastsocket customized kernel module source code of the fastsocket kernel module library source code of user level library to support fastsocket scripts scripts to set nic and system environment not compulsory for fastsocket demo source code of a demo server to demonstrate performance of fastsocket the following commands will build and install the kernel after fastsocket repository is downloaded from git you can customize the config file if you are sure you will not miss some important component fastsocket can be built smoothly on  bit centos  x systems problems may arise on  bit systems and centos  systems root localhost cd fastsocket and kernel root localhost kernel make defconfig root localhost kernel make root localhost kernel make modulesinstall root localhost kernel make install enter the library directory and make the library root localhost fastsocket cd library root localhost library make after that libfsocket so is created in the same directory when the installation is done remember to modify grub file to switch to the fastsocket kernel and reboot the system after booting into the kernel with fastsocket load the fastsocket module with default parameters root localhost modprobe fastsocket for more detailed information of modules parameters please refer to module module and readme md fastsocket module two ways to check if the module is loaded successfully check lsmod root localhost lsmod and grep fastsocket fastsocket   check dmesg root localhost dmesg and tail fastsocket load module fastsocket enable listen spawn mode  fastsocket enable recieve flow deliver fastsocket enable fast epoll run nic sh provided in the scripts directory of the repository to take care of remaining configuration root localhost cd fastsocket root localhost fastsocket scripts and nic sh i eth eth is the interface to be used and should be changed according to your system configuration the script will automatically check system and nic parameters then configures various features if you are interested in how nic sh works please refer to scripts scripts and readme md configuration scripts generally scenarios meeting the following conditions will benefit the most from fastsocket v  the machine has no less than  cpu cores large portion of the cpu cycles is spent in network softirq and socket related system calls short tcp connections are heavily used application uses non blocking io over epoll as the io framework application uses multiple processes to accept connections individually meanwhile we are developing fastsocket to improve the network stack performance in more general scenarios you can refer to new features new features fastsocket is enabled by preloading a shared library named libfsocket so when launching an application for example ngnix can be started with fastsocket by root localhost fastsocket cd library root localhost library ldpreload and libfsocket so nginx without the preloaded library applications can run as if they are on the original kernel which provides a super quick rollback in case there is a need root localhost nginx for more information about the library please refer to library library and readme md fastsocket library here we list a few applications that are working fine with fastsocket haproxy nginx do disable accept mutex lighttpd we are also using fastsocket on the load generators in our benchmark tests this is very helpful since fastsocket greatly increases the maximum work load that could be generated from a single machine which saves machines and operations these load generators are httpload we provide a demo server in the demo directory of the repository the demo server does nothing but read and write messages from and to network sockets and is purely used to study and benchmark the performance of network stack of linux kernel when the demo server is running it has little user cpu consumption which makes it a perfect network application to observe the network stack performance moreover it is also used to demonstrate the scalability and performance improvement of fastsocket over the base linux kernel for more information about the demo server please refer to demo demo and readme md demo server some important configurations worker number is set to the number of cpu cores http keep alive is disabled on nginx for a short connection test httpload fetches a  bytes static file from nginx with a concurrency of  multiplied by the number of cores we enable memory cache for that static file in order to rule out any disk affection accept mutex is disabled the default value of nginx is on note you d better do disable acceptmutex with default fastsocket module parameters fastsocket has partioned listen socket therefore there is no need to force user to accept connections one by one if some cpu had no chance to receive packet especially the tcp syn packet by rps or others the nginx would fail to accept the new conn forever with acceptmutex enabled so you should make sure the new request could be passed to every cpu if you want load blance the accept with accept mutex of nginx from the figure below fastsocket on  cpu cores achieves k connection per second cps  with a speed up of x the throughput of base centos   kernel increases non linearly up to  cpu cores and drops dramatically to k cps with  cpu cores the latest   kernel doubles the throughput to k cps when using  cpu cores compared with the base centos   kernel however it has not completely solved the scalability bottlenecks preventing it from scaling beyond  cpu cores some important configurations worker number is set to the number of cpu cores rfd receive flow deliver in fastsocket is enabled http keep alive is disabled on haproxy for a short connection test a client runs httpload with a concurrency of  multiplied by number of cores a backend server responds each incoming http request with a  bytes message as shown in the same figure fastsocket presents an excellent scalability performance which is very similar to the previous nginx case fastsocket outperforms linux   by k cps and base centos   kernel by k cps when using  cpu cores though the one core throughputs are very close among all the three kernels throughput images and throughput png throughput as mentioned before fastsocket has already been deployed in the sina production environment one typical scenario is using fastsocket with haproxy to provide http load balance service to weibo and other sina productions in the figure below it is the cpu utilization of an  core servers within  hours figure a shows the cpu utilization before deploying fastsocket and figure b shows the cpu utilization after deploying fastsocket online images and online png online we can see from the figure what happened after fastsocket is used the load of each cpu core is perfect balanced the average cpu utilization of all cpu cores is reduced by  as a result the effective capacity of the haproxy server is increased by  moreover since the server is an old  core machine we expect fastsocket would make more performance improvement when fastsocket is deployed on a machine with more cpu cores it is already observed on a  core machine after updating fastsocket we are now improving network stack efficiency in the case of long tcp connection four more features are introduced direct tcp skip the route process when receiving packets if these packets belong to upper tcp sockets skb pool get skb from per core pre allocated skb pool instead of kernel slab receive cpu select steer a packet to a cpu core where application is waiting for it the idea is similar with rfs from google however it is lighter and more accurate rps framework we extend the idea of rps that is to redispatch the receiving packets before they entering the network stack we build a framework where developers can implement their own packets redispatching rules in out of tree module and hook into the rps framework we evaluated our new work on redis which is a typical and popular key value cache application some important configurations redis works in persistent tcp connection mode multiple redis instances are set up each redis instance listens on a different port and binds to a different cpu core the  redis instance test shows with commodity nic supporting rss fastsocket improves the throughput by more than  with advanced nic supporting flow director intel   a  improvement can be reached these new features are in the experimental stage neither well tuned for performance nor proved stable by long time production environment running there new features are complementary to the features in v  therefore nginx and haproxy performance can be further increased by fastsocket with these new features mailing list fastsocket librelist com sending a mail to the address above will subcribe to the mailing list the subject and message do not matter
28438, statemachine adds support for creating state machines for attributes on any ruby class development git and and github com and pluginaweek and statemachine git mailing list state machines make it dead simple to manage the behavior of a class too often the state of an object is kept by creating multiple boolean attributes and deciding how to behave based on the values this can become cumbersome and difficult to maintain when the complexity of your class starts to increase statemachine simplifies this design by introducing the various parts of a real state machine including states events transitions and callbacks however the api is designed to be so simple you don t even need to know what a state machine is some brief high level features include defining state machines on any ruby class multiple state machines on a single class namespaced state machines before and after and around and failure transition hooks with explicit transition requirements integration with activemodel activerecord datamapper mongoid mongomapper and sequel state predicates state driven instance and class behavior state values of any data type dynamically generated state values event parallelization attribute based event transitions path analysis inheritance internationalization graphviz visualization creator yard integration ruby   and only flexible machine syntax examples of the usage patterns for some of the above features are shown below you can find much more detailed documentation in the actual api below is an example of many of the features offered by this plugin

vehicle statename parked in addition to being able to define state machines on all ruby classes a set of out of the box integrations are available for some of the more popular ruby libraries these integrations add library specific behavior allowing for state machines to work more tightly with the conventions defined by those libraries the integrations currently available include activemodel classes activerecord models datamapper resources mongoid models mongomapper models sequel models a brief overview of these integrations is described below the activemodel integration is useful for both standalone usage and for providing the base implementation for orms which implement the activemodel api this integration adds support for validation errors dirty attribute tracking and observers

transition parked idling state firstgear secondgear do validatespresenceof seatbelton def putonseatbelt def benchmark yield for more information about the various behaviors added for sequel state machines see statemachine integrations sequel every event defined for a state machine generates an instance method on the class that allows the event to be explicitly triggered most of the examples in the statemachine documentation use this technique however with some types of integrations like activerecord you can also implicitly fire events by setting a special attribute on the instance suppose you re using the activerecord integration and the following model is class vehicle activerecord base statemachine initial parked do event ignite do transition parked idling to trigger the ignite event you would typically call the vehicle ignite method like so vehicle vehicle create vehicle id  state parked vehicle ignite true vehicle state idling this is referred to as an explicit event transition the same behavior can also be achieved implicitly by setting the state event attribute and invoking the action associated with the state machine for example vehicle vehicle create vehicle id  state parked vehicle stateevent ignite ignite vehicle save true vehicle state idling vehicle stateevent nil as you can see the ignite event was automatically triggered when the save action was called this is particularly useful if you want to allow users to drive the state transitions from a web api see each integration s api documentation for more information on the implicit approach in all of the examples used throughout the documentation you ll notice that states and events are almost always referenced as symbols this isn t a requirement but rather a suggested best practice you can very well define your state machine with strings like so class vehicle statemachine initial parked do event ignite do transition parked idling  you could even use numbers as your state and event names the important thing to keep in mind is that the type being used for referencing states and events in your machine definition must be consistent if you re using symbols then all states and events must use symbols otherwise you ll encounter the following class vehicle statemachine do event ignite do transition parked idling there is an exception to this rule the consistency is only required within the definition itself however when the machine s helper methods are called with input from external sources such as a web form statemachine will map that input to a string and symbol for example class vehicle statemachine initial parked do event ignite do transition parked idling v vehicle new vehicle xbdaf state parked v state parked true v state parked true note that none of this actually has to do with the type of the value that gets stored by default all state values are assumed to be string regardless of whether the state names are symbols or strings if you want to store states as symbols instead you ll have to be explicit about it class vehicle statemachine initial parked do event ignite do transition parked idling states each do and state and self state state name value state name tosym v vehicle new vehicle xbdaf state parked v state parked true v state parked true although statemachine introduces a simplified syntax it still remains backwards compatible with previous versions and other state related libraries by providing some flexibility around how transitions are defined see below for an overview of these syntaxes in general it s recommended that state machines use the implicit syntax for transitions however you can be a little more explicit and verbose about transitions by using the from  exceptfrom  to  and exceptto options for example transitions and callbacks can be defined like so class vehicle statemachine initial parked do beforetransition from parked exceptto parked do putonseatbelt aftertransition to parked do and transition and self seatbelt off self is the record event ignite do transition from parked to idling some flexibility is provided around the context in which transitions can be defined in almost all examples throughout the documentation transitions are defined within the context of an event if you prefer to have state machines defined in the context of a state either out of preference or in order to easily migrate from a different library you can do so as shown below class vehicle statemachine initial parked do state parked do transition to idling on ignite shiftup  if seatbelton def speed  end state firstgear do transition to secondgear on shiftup def speed  end state idling firstgear do transition to parked on park in the above example there s no need to specify the from state for each transition since it s inferred from the context you can also define transitions completely outside the context of a particular state and event this may be useful in cases where you re building a state machine from a data store instead of part of the class definition see the example below class vehicle statemachine initial parked do transition parked idling on ignite shiftup transition firstgear secondgear secondgear thirdgear on shiftup transition idling firstgear parked on park transition idling firstgear parked on park notice that in these alternative syntaxes you can continue to configure if and unless conditions you can continue to define from states when in the machine context using the all  any  and same helper methods in most cases the definition of a state machine is static that is to say the states events and possible transitions are known ahead of time even though they may depend on data that s only known at runtime for example certain transitions may only be available depending on an attribute on that object it s being run on all of the documentation in this library define static machines class vehicle statemachine state initial parked do event park do transition idling firstgear parked however there may be cases where the definition of a state machine is dynamic this means that you don t know the possible states or events for a machine until runtime for example you may allow users in your application to manage the state machine of a project or task in your system this means that the list of transitions and their associated states and events could be stored externally such as in a database in a case like this you can define dynamically generated state machines like so class vehicle attraccessor state make sure the machine gets initialized so the initial state gets set properly def initialize super machine replace this with an external source like a db def transitions parked idling on ignite  idling firstgear firstgear secondgear on shiftup  create a state machine for this vehicle instance dynamically based on the transitions defined from the source above def machine vehicle self machine and and machine new vehicle initial parked action save do vehicle transitions each and attrs and transition attrs def save save the state change class machine def self new object args block machineclass class new machine machineclass statemachine args block attribute machine

state idling vehicle state idling vehicle machine statetransitions statemachine transition vehicle machine definition states keys firstgear secondgear parked idling as you can see statemachine provides enough flexibility for you to be able to create new machine definitions on the fly based on an external source of transitions by default statemachine extends the ruby core with a statemachine method on class all other parts of the library are confined within the statemachine namespace while this isn t wholly necessary it also doesn t have any performance impact and makes it truly feel like an extension to the language this is very similar to the way that you ll find yaml  json  or other libraries adding a simple method to all objects just by loading the library however if you d like to avoid having statemachine add this extension to the ruby core you can do so like so require statemachine and core class vehicle extend statemachine macromethods statemachine do  if you re using a gem loader like bundler you can explicitly indicate which file to load gem statemachine  require statemachine and core this library comes with built in support for generating di graphs based on the this requires that both the ruby graphviz gem and graphviz library be installed on the system to generate a graph for a specific file and class rake statemachine draw file vehicle rb class vehicle to save files to a specific path rake statemachine draw file vehicle rb class vehicle target files to customize the image format and orientation rake statemachine draw file vehicle rb class vehicle format jpg orientation landscape supported image formats if resolution is an issue the svg format may offer better results to generate multiple state machine graphs rake statemachine draw file vehicle rbcar rb class vehiclecar to use human state and event names rake statemachine draw file vehicle rb class vehicle humannames true note that this will generate a different file for every state machine defined in the class the generated files will use an output filename of the format classname  machinename format for examples of actual images generated using this task see those under the examples folder is a great tool for simulating visualizing and transforming finite state automata and turing machines it can help in the creation of states and events for your models it is cross platform written in java if you use yard to generate documentation for your projects statemachine can be enabled to generate api docs for auto generated methods from each state machine definition as well as providing embedded visualizations see the generated api documentation under the examples folder to see what the output looks like to enable the yard integration you ll need to add statemachine to the list of yard s plugins by editing the global yard config and yard and config loadplugins true autoloadplugins statemachine once enabled simply generate your documentation like you normally do note that this only works for ruby   and integrating statemachine into your ruby on rails application is straightforward and provides a few additional features specific to the framework to get started following the steps below if using rails  x rails initializer run do and config and config gem statemachine  version   if using rails  x or up gem statemachine gem ruby graphviz  require graphviz optional only required for graphing as usual run bundle install to load the gems create a model with a field to store the state along with other any other fields your application requires rails generate model vehicle state string rake db migrate add the state machine to your model following the examples above app and models and vehicle rb might become class vehicle activerecord base statemachine initial parked do beforetransition parked any parked do putonseatbelt there is a special integration rake task for generating state machines for classes used in a ruby on rails application this task will load the application environment meaning that it s unnecessary to specify the actual file to load for example rake statemachine draw class vehicle if you are using this library as a gem in rails  x the following must be added to the end of your application s rakefile in order for the above task to work require tasks and statemachine like ruby on rails there is a special integration rake task for generating state machines for classes used in a merb application this task will load the application environment meaning that it s unnecessary to specify the actual files to load for example rake statemachine draw class vehicle to run the core test suite does not test any of the integrations bundle install bundle exec rake test to run integration tests bundle install rake appraisal install rake appraisal test you can also test a specific version rake appraisal activemodel    test rake appraisal activerecord    test rake appraisal datamapper    test rake appraisal mongoid    test rake appraisal mongomapper    test rake appraisal sequel    test the following caveats should be noted when using statemachine overridden event methods won t get invoked when using attribute based event transitions datamapper attribute based event transitions are disabled when using dm validations       datamapper transitions cannot persist states when run from after create and save callbacks jruby and rubinius aroundtransition callbacks in orm integrations won t work on jruby since it doesn t support continuations factory girl dynamic initial states don t work because of the way factorygirl builds objects you can work around this in a few ways  use a default state that is common across all objects and rely on events to determine the actual initial state for your object  assuming you re not using state driven behavior on initialization you can re initialize states after the fact factorygirl define do factory vehicle do afterbuild and user and user send initializestatemachines dynamic

alternatively if you have a icns file gallium bundle myapp icon myapp icns you can write c or objective c code that interfaces directly with native windowing apis the following example uses the macos native api nswindow setalphavalue to create a semi transparent window package main runtime github com and alexflint and gallium void setalpha void window float alpha and and cocoa requires that all ui

which is not the architecture being linked x go and src and github com and alexflint and gallium and dist and gallium framework and gallium then you probably have an issue with git lfs you can confirm that this is the problem by checking the size of the file in the error message it should be over  mb but if you see a much smaller file then this is your problem to fix this try re installing git lfs as described in the installation section above then delete and re install gallium no console output when you run an app bundle with open foo app  osx launch services discards standard output and standard error if you need to see this output for debugging purposes use a redirect gallium redirectstdoutstderr output log app does not start when you run an app bundle with open foo app  osx launch services will only start your app if there is not already another instance of the same application running so if your app refuses to start then try checking the activity monitor for an already running instance menus not visible if you run the binary directly without building an app bundle then your menus will not show up and the window will initially appear behind other applications it is very important that the first statement in your main function be runtime lockosthread the reason is that gallium calls out to various c functions in order to create and manage osx ui elements and many of these are required to be called from the first thread created by the process but the go runtime creates many threads and any one piece of go code could end up running on any thread the solution is runtime lockosthread  which tells the go scheduler to lock the current goroutine so that it will only ever run on the current thread since the main function always starts off on the main thread this wil guarantee that the later call to gallium loop will also be on the main thread at this point gallium takes ownership of this thread for its main event loop and calls the onready callback in a separate goroutine from this point forward it is safe to call gallium functions from any goroutine gallium is based on chromium which it accesses via gallium framework that framework in turn contains libchromiumcontent dylib  which is a shared library containing the chromium content module and is distributed in binary form by the same folks responsible for the excellent electron framework when you build your go executable the directives in gallium framework instruct the linker to set up the executable to look for gallium framework in two places at runtime  dir containing executable and and frameworks and gallium framework this will resolve correctly if you choose to build and run your app as a bundle and also means you can distribute the app bundle as a self contained unit  gopath and src and github com and alexflint and dist and gallium framework this will resolve if you choose to run your executable directly

resolves when unliked type string like a comment returns a promise and resolves when liked type string unlike a comment returns a promise and resolves when unliked gitment is easy to customize you can use your own css or write a theme the difference is that customized css can t modify dom structure gitment does t use any atomic css making it easier and more flexible to customize you can inspect the dom structure in the browser and write your own styles a gitment theme is an object contains several render functions by default gitment has five render functions render  renderheader  rendercomments  rendereditor  renderfooter the last four render independent components and render functions render them together all of them can be used independently you can override any render function above or write your own render function for example you can override the render function to put an editor before the comment list and render a new component javascript const mytheme render state instance const

necessary for oauth without which users can t login or comment with their github accounts although github does t recommend to hard code client secret in the frontend you can still do that because github will verify your callback url in theory no one else can use your secret except your site because github doesn t attach a cors header to it this service won t record or store anything it only attaches a cors header to that request and provides proxy so that users can login in the frontend without any server side implementation
79343907, the organisation is inspired by the tf slim models repository containing the implementation of popular architectures resnet inception and vgg hence it is separated in three main parts datasets interface to popular datasets pascal voc coco and scripts to convert the former to tf records networks definition of ssd networks and common encoding and decoding methods we refer to the paper on this precise topic pre processing pre processing and data augmentation routines inspired by original vgg and inception implementations the ssd notebook notebooks and ssdnotebook ipynb contains a minimal example of the ssd tensorflow pipeline shortly the detection is made of two main steps running the ssd network on the image and post processing the output using common algorithms top k filtering and non maximum suppression algorithm here are two examples of successful detection outputs pictures and ex png ssd anchors pictures and ex png ssd anchors to run the notebook you first have to unzip the checkpoint files in and checkpoint unzip ssdvgg ckpt zip and then start a jupyter notebook with jupyter notebook notebooks and ssdnotebook ipynb the current version only supports pascal voc datasets  and  in order to be used for training a ssd model the former need to be converted to tf records using the tfconvertdata py script datasetdir and voc and test and outputdir and tfrecords python tfconvertdata py datasetname pascalvoc datasetdir datasetdir outputname voctrain outputdir outputdir note the previous command generated a collection of tf records instead of a single file in order to ease shuffling during training the present tensorflow implementation of ssd models have the following performances and model and training data and testing data and map and fps and and and and and and and after downloading and extracting the previous checkpoints the evaluation metrics should be reproducible by running the following command evaldir and logs and checkpointpath and checkpoints and vggvocssdxftiter ckpt python evalssdnetwork py evaldir evaldir datasetdir datasetdir datasetname pascalvoc datasetsplitname test modelname ssdvgg checkpointpath checkpointpath batchsize  the evaluation script provides estimates on the recall precision curve and compute the map metrics following the pascal voc  and  guidelines in addition if one wants to experiment and test a different caffe ssd checkpoint the former can be converted to tensorflow checkpoints as following caffemodel and ckpts and ssdxftvoc and vggvocssdxftiter caffemodel python caffetotensorflow py modelname ssdvgg numclasses  caffemodelpath caffemodel the script trainssdnetwork py is in charged of training the network similarly to tf slim models one can pass numerous options to the training process dataset optimiser hyper parameters model in particular it is possible to provide a checkpoint file which can be use as starting point in order to fine tune a network the easiest way to fine the ssd model is to use as pre trained ssd network vgg  or vgg  for instance one can fine a model starting from the former as following datasetdir and tfrecords traindir and logs and checkpointpath and checkpoints and ssdvgg ckpt python trainssdnetwork py traindir traindir datasetdir datasetdir datasetname pascalvoc datasetsplitname train modelname ssdvgg checkpointpath checkpointpath savesummariessecs  saveintervalsecs  weightdecay   optimizer adam learningrate   batchsize  note that in addition to the training script flags one may also want to experiment with data augmentation parameters random cropping resolution in ssdvggpreprocessing py or and and network parameters feature layers anchors boxes in ssdvgg and  py furthermore the training script can be combined with the evaluation routine in order to monitor the performance of saved checkpoints on a validation dataset for that purpose one can pass to training and validation scripts a gpu memory upper limit such that both can run in parallel on the same device if some gpu memory is available for the evaluation script the former can be run in parallel as follows evaldir traindir and eval python evalssdnetwork py evaldir evaldir datasetdir datasetdir datasetname pascalvoc datasetsplitname test modelname ssdvgg checkpointpath traindir waitforcheckpoints true batchsize  maxnumbatches

you use to run babel presets env  targets node current check out the many options especially usebuiltins to polyfill less this should be straightforward to do in most cases there might be cases where plugins should be split up more or certain plugins aren t standalone enough or impossible to do default behavior without options is the same as babel preset latest if you are targeting ie  and chrome  it will include all plugins required by ie  since you would need to support both still for example if you are building on node  arrow functions won t be converted but they will if you build on node   npm install save dev babel preset env yarn add babel preset env dev presets env string number and string  defaults to takes an object of environment versions to support each target environment takes a number or a string we recommend using a string when specifying minor versions like node   example environments chrome  opera  edge  firefox  safari  ie  ios  android  node  electron number and string and current and true if you want to compile against the current node version you can specify node true or node current  which would be the same as node process versions node array string and string note browsers results are overridden by explicit items from targets when using uglify js to minify your code you may run into syntax errors when targeting later browsers since uglify js does not support any es and syntax to prevent these errors set the uglify option to true  which enables all transformation plugins and as a result your code is fully compiled to es however the usebuiltins option will still work as before and only include the polyfills that your target s need boolean  defaults to false enable more spec compliant but potentially slower transformations for any plugins in this preset that support them boolean  defaults to false enable loose transformations for any plugins in this preset that allow them amd and umd and systemjs and commonjs and false  defaults to commonjs enable transformation of es module syntax to another module type setting this to false will not transform modules boolean  defaults to false array string  defaults to note whitelist is deprecated and will be removed in the next major in favor of this an array of plugins to always include valid options include any this option is useful if there is a bug in a native implementation or a combination of a non supported feature and a supported one doesn t work for example node  supports native classes but not spread if super is used with a spread argument then the transform es classes transform needs to be include d as it is not possible to transpile a spread with super otherwise array string  defaults to an array of plugins to always exclude and remove the possible options are the same as the include option boolean  defaults to false a way to apply babel preset env for polyfills via babel polyfill note this does not currently polyfill experimental and stage x built ins like the regular babel polyfill does this will only work with npm  which should be used with babel  anyway npm install babel polyfill save this option enables a new plugin that replaces the statement import babel polyfill or require babel polyfill with individual requires for babel polyfill based on environment note only use require babel polyfill once in your whole app multiple imports or requires of babel polyfill will throw an error since it can cause global collisions and other issues that are hard to trace we recommend creating a single entry file that only contains the require statement import babel polyfill out different based on environment import core js and modules and es string pad start import core js and modules and es string pad end import core js and modules and web timers import core js and modules and web immediate import core js and modules and web dom iterable this will also work for core js directly import core js npm install core js save export class a babelrc

3100494, a remote monitoring application using node js mongodb and twitter bootstrap tweak frequency of monitoring on a per check basis up to the second check the presence of a pattern in the response body receive notifications whenever a check goes down by email on the console monitor availability responsiveness average response time and total uptime and downtime get details about failed checks http error code etc group checks by tags and get reports by tag complete api for integration with third party monitoring services powerful plugin system to ease extension and customization easy installation and zero administration installing uptime  uptime   requires node js   and mongodb   older versions provide compatibility with node   uptime v  and   uptime v  to install from github clone the repository and install dependencies using npm git clone git and and github com and fzaninotto and uptime git cd uptime npm install lastly start the application with node app if you want a production environment nodeenv production node app upgrading from a   install  if you have been using uptime   or   you have to execute the migration script before using the new release node models and migrations and upgradeto adding checks  by default the web ui runs on port  so just browse to and you re ready to begin create your first check by entering an url wait for the first ping and you ll soon see data flowing through your charts configuring  server localhost database uptime user root password connectionstring alternative to setting server database user and password separately name origin pollinginterval  ten seconds timeout  five seconds analyzer updateinterval  one minute qosaggregationinterval  ten minutes pinghistory  three months autostartmonitor true and plugins and console and plugins and patternmatcher and plugins and httpoptions and plugins and email to modify this configuration create a development yaml or a production yaml file in the same directory and override just the settings you need for instance to run uptime on port  in production create a production yaml file as follows node that uptime works great behind a proxy it uses the httpproxy environment variable transparently architecture  uptime is composed of two services a webapp in app js  and a polling monitor in monitor js for your convenience the two services start together when you call node app however heavily browsing the webapp may slow down the whole server including the polling monitor in other terms using the application can influence the uptime measurements to avoid this effect it is recommended to run the polling monitor in a separate process to that extent set the autostartmonitor setting to false in the production yaml  and launch the monitor by hand node monitor node app don t forget to set nodeenv production if you want to run the app in production environment you can also run the monitor in a different server this second server must be able to reach the api of the webapp server set the monitor apiurl setting accordingly in the production yaml file of the monitor server monitoring from various locations  you can even run several monitor servers in several datacenters to get average response time in that case make sure you set a different monitor name setting for all monitor servers to be able to tell which server make a particular ping using plugins  plugins can add more notification types more poller types new routes to the webapp etc uptime currently bundles three plugins to enable plugins just add a line to the plugins section of the configuration file three of the bundled plugins are already enabled by default and plugins and console and plugins and patternmatcher and plugins and httpoptions and plugins and email and plugins and basicauth you can override these settings in your environment configuration for instance and plugins and console and plugins and patternmatcher and plugins and httpoptions and plugins and email and plugins and basicauth third party plugins writing plugins  a plugin is a simple node js module which hooks into predefined extension points uptime automatically requires plugin modules when starting the webapp and the monitor and tries to call the two following functions initwebapp options when starting the webapp initmonitor options when starting the monitor for instance if you had to recreate a simple version of the console plugin you could write it as follows and and in plugins and console and index js var checkevent require and and models and checkevent exports initwebapp function

download the diff of the pull request and figure out which files and lines have been touched for these it will download the associated blame to figure out who last touched that line as they may be a good reviewer after running the algorithm algorithm described in the next section it will comment on the pull request notifying those people and go back to sleep the problem of finding who the best reviewers are is really hard and i don t think that any algorithm will achieve perfection instead what we want here is to be best effort we want to notify people that are likely going to be interested and be good reviewers if we ping a few too many people that s not the end of the world neither if we don t ping the exact right person we use two heuristics if a line was deleted or modified the person that last touched that line is likely going to care about this pull request if a person last touched many lines in the file where the change was made they will want to be notified initialization create two empty hash map deletedlines for authors of deleted lines alllines for authors of lines in the changed files filling the data structures for each deleted line find the author in the blame and increase its count by one in the deletedlines map for each line in every file that was changed find the author in the blame and increase its count by one in the alllines map since getting the blame information is sending an http request to github it is pretty expensive we first sort the files by number of deleted lines and only pick the top  since we re only looking for  names and the algorithm is best effort this greatly speeds up the algorithm in case of large pull requests for little loss in precision putting it all together delete from alllines all the names that appear in both maps we don t want to mention the same person twice sort each map by count concat deletedlines with alllines take the first three names if you want to use a different account for the bot change the message or extend it with more functionalities we ve tried to make it super easy cd mention bot npm install npm start alternatively click the button below if you would like the mention bot

5546286, and and and and and and and and  and  and and  and with grunticon version   we ve added the enhancesvg option which allows you to easily style and animate your svgs with css or add interactivity with javascript standard grunticons are static background images that can t be styled or scripted because svg only supports this ability if the svg data is in the html document in   you can now choose which icons you want to enhance and the new loader script will copy the icon svg paths from the cached grunticon stylesheet and inject them as an embedded svg element for you to script and style as needed this allows us to offer the best of both worlds the full power of embedded svgs but with none the wasted bandwidth of including svgs in your page markup remember that only browsers that support svgs will see these effects so use them only for enhancements that don t break the experience when not present embedding icons also has some degree of execution overhead so we recommend using this feature sparingly only embed an icon if you need to apply style or scripting otherwise use the classic background image icon to start in your gruntfile js set the value for enhancesvg to true so the loader will parse the markup for icons that should be embedded at runtime javascript grunticon files and and handle files here options and and handle your options as you normally would here enhancesvg true just after the loader you ll need to call grunticon and pass your  css file paths to it as usual additionally though you ll want to add a fourth argument to kick off the svg embedding which we ve pre defined for you as grunticon svgloadedcallback in all your call to grunticon will now look something like this javascript grunticon icons data svg css  icons data png css  icons fallback css  grunticon svgloadedcallback after you ve done this you can have any icon embedded in the page and ready for styling just by adding a data grunticon embed attribute once the loader runs the svg will be embedded g class hamburger and path and path and path and path and path and path and path now style appropriately icon burger width px height px display inline block icon burger alt cheese fill red icon burger alt buns fill orange icon burger alt burger fill yellow icon burger alt lettuce fill green and voila styled svg icons if you re hosting your grunticon css on a different domain than your html you will need to do a little extra configuration to use svg embedding  set the corsembed option to true in your gruntfile this adds a little extra scripting to the grunticon loader so that it can make a cross domain request  once that s in change the callback at the end of your grunticon call to reference svgloadedcorscallback instead of the one listed above  that might be enough but if not you ll need to enable cross domain requests on the server where the css is hosted here s how that looks in apache htaccess for example ifmodule modheaders c header add access control allow origin and ifmodule that can be a particular domain if you want this plugin requires grunt    once you re familiar with that process you may install this plugin with this command npm install grunt grunticon save dev once the plugin has been installed it may be enabled inside your gruntfile with this line of javascript grunt loadnpmtasks grunt grunticon grunticon has a files object that needs to be filled in order to run this files object currently requires that a cwd and a dest dir are placed and therefore will blow up without it this will be fixed to better fit the pattern set by grunt for this these can be set in your gruntfile js config file grunticon is a multitask making it easy to create as many export batches as you d like just create one or more custom named objects within the grunticon object and configure grunticon options within it like so javascript grunticon myicons files expand true cwd example and source  src svg  png  dest example and output options important note grunticon will overwrite any files in the dest directory if they are of the same name as a file that grunticon needs to create for easiest results you can set dest to a folder that does not yet exist in your directory and grunticon will create that folder or set it to an existing folder and be sure to configure grunticon to create file names that do not already exist in that folder with these configuration properties set you can add grunticon to your default tasks list that ll look something like this grunt registertask default  jshint  qunit  concat  uglify  grunticon myicons grunticon will now batch your icons whenever you run grunt type string default value icons data svg css the name of the generated css file containing svg data uris type string default value icons data png css the name of the generated css file containing png data uris type string default value icons fallback css the name of the generated css file containing external png url

methods in the loader script to offer cross domain svg embedding options enhancesvg must be true for this option to be respected type string default value png and the name of the generated folder containing the generated png images type string default value value of options pngfolder allows you to specify a custom url to serve fallback pngs at pngpath and assets and icons and png will generate png fallbacks like icon bar background image url and assets and icons and png and bar png background repeat no repeat type string default value icon a string to prefix all icon selectors with currently only classes or ids are guaranteed to work with the preview type object allows you to specify custom selectors for individual files this is in addition to the selectors generated using cssprefix and filename extension javascript foo icon bar  baz will produce icon bar icon foo you can also use an asterisk in your custom selector the filename can be referenced with  examples javascript customselectors icon  before  icon  what  hey  cssprefix icon should give the file bear svg the css icon bear before icon bear what hey bear icon bear and and css things and if there are files bear svg and cat svg the css should be like icon bear before icon bear what hey bear icon bear and and css things icon cat before icon cat what hey cat icon cat and and css things this should give you more flexibility with your selectors type string default value px a string that must be defined in px that will be the size of the png if there is no width given in the svg element type string default value px similar to defaultwidth but for height type string default value goes to the example and preview hbs file takes a path to the template that will be used for the preview html

background image url datauri background repeat no repeat type boolean default value false will compress the converted png files using optipng type integer default value  if compress is set to true  this will set the optimationlevel for optipng grunticon allows you to output any icon in different colors simply by changing its filename to the following syntax myfilename colors red aa gray svg in this example any color names or hexidecimal values that follow colors and are separated by a dash will be used to generate additional icons of that color by default each icon will be assigned a numbered class name for css use you can improve the class naming conventions by defining color variables in your gruntfile s colors option shown below when defined you can reference a color variable in place of a color in your file names and the generated classes will use that variable name as well see the gruntfile js s colors and dynamiccoloronly options for an example of how color automation a note on filesize impact adding color variations of an icon involves creating duplicates of that icon s svg source in the css so unfortunately each color variation will cause an increase in filesize however transferring css with gzip compression can negate much of this filesize increase and we highly recommend always transferring with gzip in testing we found that creating a color variation of every icon in our example set increased overall size by   rather than  as a raw text duplicate would increase that said size increases for non svg supporting browsers will be more dramatic as the fallback pngs will not have the heavy transfer compression as svg enjoys we advise using this feature on a case by case basis to ensure overhead is kept to a minimum allows you to predefine colors as variables that can be used in filename color configuration options colors myawesomered fcd  coolblue ff type boolean default value false allows you to tell directory colorfy to ignore the original file when using colors for example if given a file named like so bear colors white svg and dynamiccoloronly is set to true dynamiccoloronly true then only a single file bear white svg  will be generated rather than two bear svg with the original colors and bear white svg with white colors with enhancesvg turned on the grunticon loader has a few exposed methods and attributes on the grunticon object that you can use type string the url that is being loaded by grunticon type string is svg if the page loaded the svg based css is datapng if the page loaded the png with datauri based css is png if the page loaded the plain link to png based css arguments string returns object fetch a stylesheet link by its href arguments string returns object takes a stylesheet node link or style and returns all of the icon selectors and the svgs contained within it in an object formatted in this way grunticon selector svg content in string arguments object returns nodelist takes icons in the object format outputted by geticons and then queries the page for all icons with the data grunticon embed attribute for each of these that it finds it places the svg contents associated with the relevant selector in the icons it then returns the nodelist of all of the elements that had svgs embedded arguments function returns none an alternative to listening for the domcontentloaded event takes a function as a callback and calls the function when the dom is ready arguments function returns none uses the above methods to call var svgloadedcallback function embedcomplete ready function embedicons geticons grunticon href embedcomplete if embedcomplete is defined the loader will call it when svg embedding is complete this is true for both local and cors embedding so if you need to run logic after svg markup is appended to the dom just pass a callback to grunticon svgloadedcallback or grunticon svgloadedcorscallback with enhancesvg and corsembed turned on the grunticon loader has a few exposed  more methods and attributes on the grunticon object that you can use arguments string  function returns object first argument is a string reference to a url to request via cross domain ajax second argument is an optional callback when the request finishes loading in the callback this refers to the xhr object arguments function returns none uses the above methods to make svg embedding work when css is hosted on another domain cors must be allowed on the external domain the generated asynchronous css loader script delivers an appropriate icon stylesheet depending on a device and browser s capabilities grunticon is supported in cases where icon fonts fail browsers that render the svg data url stylesheet chrome  and maybe older too safari  and maybe older too firefox   and maybe older too opera  and ios  and safari and chrome android   chrome caveat svg icons do not scale in vector but do appear to draw in high resolution android   ics browser blackberry playbook browsers that receive the png data url stylesheet all versions of opera opera mini and opera mobile before chrome integration v  android   browser android   browser android   browser android   browser android   browser browsers that receive the fallback png request non javascript environments in earlier versions of grunticon we included svgo to optimize the svg output in the   version we removed this dependency to ease the installation complexity but still recommend that svg optimization is part of the grunticon workflow when producing svgs through a tool like illustrator there is a lot of unnecessary markup comments and general code written into your svg if run before running grunticon it can greatly reduce your filesizes here s an example svgmin options plugins and and don t remove xml declaration needed to avoid errors creating png on win  removexmlprocinst false files expand true cwd example and svgs  src svg  dest example and source grunticon files expand true cwd example and source  src svg  png  dest example and output options the svgmin options section is only needed to avoid errors under windows and can be omitted for smaller svg files on other platforms for a more extensive example check out our gruntfile example project one of the great benefits to data uris is the ability to compress the images heavily via gzip compression be sure to enable gzip of css on your server as it ll cut your icon transfer size greatly the workflow we ve been using so far involves creating a new illustrator file with the artboard set to the desired size of the icon you want set in the css export the artwork by choosing file save as in the dialog choose svg as the format and enter a name for the file this wil be used as your class name later so keep it free of any disallowed css class characters like     etc in the save svg dialog that opens up there are lots of options svg has a ton of formats so here are a few tips we ve learned svg profile seems like svg   tiny is really well supported across even older mobile platforms so if you have simple artwork that doesn t use gradients or opacity this will yield a smaller and more compatible graphic if you want to use all the fancy effects save artwork as svg   type convert to outline before export subsetting none i usually convert all text to outlines ahead of time images embed don t check preserve

using shape shifter ask your manager to support us we ll display your logo below with a link to your site here are some example icon animations created by shape shifter writing high quality path morphing animations adp path morphing is a tedious and time consuming task in order to morph one shape into another the svg paths describing the two must be compatible with each other mdash that is they need to have the same number and type of drawing commands this is problematic because design tools mdash such as sketch sketch and illustrator illustrator mdash do not easily expose the order of points in a shape making it difficult to change their order as a result engineers will often have to spend time tweaking the raw svg path strings given to them by designers before they can be morphed which can take a significant amount of time design tools often map to shape primitives not supported in certain platforms e g circles need to be represented by a sequence of curves and and or arcs not simply by their center point and radius design tools cannot place multiple path points in the same location a technique that is often necessary when making two shapes compatible with each other design tools provide no easy way to visualize the in between states of the desired path morph animation to address these problems shape shifter provides the following features the ability to add and remove points to each path without altering their original appearance the added points can be modified by dragging them to different positions along the path and they can be later deleted using the keyboard as well the ability to reverse and shift the relative positions of each path s points while reordering points won t affect whether or not two paths are compatible it often plays a huge role in determining the appearance of the resulting animation shape shifter automatically converts incompatible pairs of svg commands into a compatible format there s no longer any need to convert l s into q s and a s into c s by hand in order to make your paths compatible mdash shape shifter does this for you behind the scenes shape shifter provides a useful utility called auto fix  which takes two incompatible paths and attempts to make them compatible in an optimal way depending on the complexity of the paths auto fix may or may not generate a satisfying final result so further modification may be necessary in order to achieve the animation you re looking for the ability to export the results to svg spritesheets css keyframes and animatedvectordrawable format for use on the web and in android applications i m open to adding support for other export formats as well so feel free to file a feature request report feature request pretty much all of the graphics in this app are powered by bezier curve approximations under the hood i learned most of what i needed to know from this excellent primer on bezier curves primer on bezier curves especially sections  and  which explain how to split and project points onto bezier curves without altering their original appearance most of the interesting svg related code auto fix is powered by an adaptation of the needleman wunsch algorithm needleman wunsch  which is used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences instead of aligning dna base pairs shape shifter aligns the individual svg commands that make up each path instead you can view the current implementation of the algorithm in the let me know if you encounter any issues with the app attach svg files and and or screenshots if you can before you do take a look at the list of known issues on the existing bugs you want to see fixed in a future release i am open to pretty much any feature request so don t be afraid to ask i ll likely work on the most popular feature requests first i m especially curious how i can make this web app more useful for ios and web developers if you want to contribute you can build and serve the web app locally as

73660839, some of deepmind s recent papers are tricky to reproduce the paper also omitted specific details about the implementation and we had to fill the gaps in our own way here are a few important notes first while the paper used the timit dataset for the speech recognition experiment we used the free vtck dataset third since the timit dataset has phoneme labels the paper trained the model with two loss terms phoneme classification and next phoneme prediction we instead used a single ctc loss because vctk provides sentence level labels as a result we used only dilated convd layers without any dilated convd layers finally we didn t do quantitative analyses such as bleu score and post processing by combining a language model due to the time constraints the final architecture is shown in the following figure current version       if you have problems with the librosa library try to install ffmpeg by the following command ubuntu   sudo add apt repository ppa mcman and trusty media sudo apt get update sudo apt get dist upgrade y sudo apt get y install ffmpeg and code and pre total number of sentences in the training set composed of the above three corpus is  valid and test set is built using only librispeech and tedlium corpuse because vctk corpus does not have valid and test set after downloading the each corpus extract them in the asset and data and vctk corpus  asset and data and librispeech and asset and data and tedliumrelease directories thanks migvel for your kind information the tedlium release  dataset provides audio data in the sph format so we should convert them to some format librosa library can handle run the following command in the asset and data directory convert sph to wave format find type f name sph and awk printf sox t sph s b  t wav s n    wav and bash and code and pre if you don t have installed sox  please installed it first sudo apt get install sox and code and pre we found the main bottle neck is disk read time when training so we decide to pre process the whole audio data into the mfcc feature files which is much smaller and we highly recommend using ssd instead of hard drive run the following command in the console to pre process whole dataset python preprocess py and code and pre python train py use all available gpus cudavisibledevices  python train py use only gpu   and code and pre to train the network you can see the result ckpt files and log files in the asset and train directory launch tensorboard logdir asset and train and log to monitor training process we ve trained this model on a  nvidia  pascal gpus during  hours until  epochs and we picked the epoch when the validatation loss is minimum in our case it is epoch  if you face the out of memory error reduce batchsize in the train py file from  to  the ctc losses at each epoch are as following table and epoch and train set and valid set and test set and and and and and and and  and   and   and   and and  and   and   and   and and  and   and   and   and and  and   and   and   and after training finished you can check valid or test set ctc loss by the following command python test py set train and valid and test frac       and code and pre the frac option will be useful if you want to test only the fraction of dataset for fast evaluation python recognize py file wavefile path and code and pre to transform a speech wave file to the english sentence the result will be printed on the console for example try the following command python recognize py file asset and data and librispeech and test clean and  and  and    flac python recognize py file asset and data and librispeech and test clean and  and  and    flac python recognize py file asset and data and librispeech and test clean and  and  and    flac python recognize py file asset and data and librispeech and test clean and  and  and    flac python recognize py file asset and data and librispeech and test clean and  and  and    flac and code and pre the result will

62973876, discovering ketosis how to effectively lose weight  weight vs time in the past  months or so weight  png weight loss progress in the following i ll describe the thought process some other people ideas and the code i used to separate signal from noise this separation was critical to help lead me in the right direction this github repository includes my code a q a section qanda md  and links for further reading the below is what worked for me your situation may be different listen to your own body the code here is designed to be used on your own data not on mine also this was not a scientific experiment or a study rather it was a personal journey of experimentation and discovery i used to be a pretty thin person my st dmv card below says  lb unfortunately since moving to the us i ve been gaining more and more weight i peaked in  over  lbs higher the us is a country where obesity is an epidemic poorer demographics in the us have higher levels of obesity first dmv photo and weight with full clothing  ariel dmv png  pounds sometime in the  s does a us typical lifestyle has anything to do with this epidemic after reading on the subject i could point at a few of the main suspects fast food is highly available and is very cheap compared to most alternatives no fat and low fat labels are everywhere on supermarket shelves as in many other instances i realized i need to think for myself ignore all expert advice question widely accepted ideas like the fda food pyramid start listening to my own body my own logic data i can collect myself and trust once i did the results followed in the past i tried several times to change my diet after reading one of atkins books i realized checked and accepted the fact that excess carbs are a major factor in gaining weight but that realization alone has not led to success my will power apparently was insufficient i had too much love of pizza and bread i would reduce my carb consumption lose a few pounds typically  pounds  and then break down go back to consuming excess carbs and gain all these pounds back and then some my longest diet stretch lasted just a few months it was obvious that something was missing in my method i just had to find it i could increase my physical activity say start training for a mini marathon but that s not something i felt comfortable with i realized early on that i need to adopt a lifestyle that not just reduces carbs or add exercise but is also sustainable and even enjoyable so it can turn into a painless routine something that i could do for years never feel the urge to break habits is not hard or unpleasant for me to do the file i kept was fairly simple a csv with  columns date  morningweight  yesterday s lifestyle and food and actions the last column is a arbitrary length list of word weight items the optional numerical weight following  expresses higher and lower quantities the default weight when missing is  comment lines ignored

you gain weight  while the negative ones bottom make you lose weight disclaimer please don t read too much into the particulars of this data working with this particular data set was pretty challenging since the number of original data points a bit over  days may be too small to establish enough significance typical daily changes in body weight are very small often   lb my scales are not accurate you may note that my data has   pound resolution this is not ideal getting scales with   pound resolution is highly recommended you may also note that the loss convergence chart hits a hard floor at   even when you do multiple passes over the data overfit the training set for a similar reason items that make you lose and gain weight often appear together on the same line so they cancel each other this throws the automatic learning process off course there were some misspellings in the original data i hope i fixed all of these by now so i focused mostly on the extremes start and end of the list as presented above and just used the hints as general guidance for further study experimentation and action despite the noisy insufficient data and the inaccuracies in weighting the machine learning experiments made  facts pretty clear pretty early sleeping longer consistently appeared as the  factor in losing weight lack of sleep did the opposite too little sleep lead to weight gains carbs made me gain weight the worst were high starch and sugary foods fatty and oily foods tended to do the opposite they were positively correlated with weight loss the stayhome lifestlye which fell mostly on weekends may have been a red herring i slept longer when i didn t have to commute to work otoh my diet on stay home days may have been different it took me a while to figure out the sleep part when we sleep we don t eat it is that simple moreover we tend to binge and snack while not particularly hungry but we never do it during sleep our sleeping time is our longest daily fasting time please note that my explanations of the effects may not in fact be accurate or deeply scientific the goal of all this was incremental discovery experiment check effect rinse repeat you may note that in the top date vs weight chart there s a notable acceleration in the rate of weight loss the cause was deeper insights and better ability to sustain the diet the more i understood the problem extending the fasting time was one major accelerator of weight loss rate i did that by skipping breakfast and stop eating earlier in the evening before going to bed this gave me   hours of fasting each day rather than the more typical   hours and day of fasting the nd accelerator was consuming fatty stuff instead of carbs in order to feel full i now believe and hope that i can go all the way back to my original weight when i first landed on us soil if i can keep the present rate it should take   years to completely reverse the damage of the past  years it is important to stress that i also feel much better the more weight i lose as a welcome side effect the few borderline and high levels in my blood tests have moved significantly towards normal averages during the period i lost weight cholesterol by the way is an essential building block for many essential body by products the liver produces as much cholesterol as we need our body is an amazing machine billions of years of evolution have made it extremely adaptive it is not our high fat consumption  it is the storage of fat process that makes us acummulate fat in the tissues and become unhealthy in a low carb and high fat lchf regime our night sleep fasting time becomes our friend the fat breaking agents keep working while we sleep breaking up the stored fat this leads to weight loss and a healthier state and when we push even further and cut carbs to really low levels we may reach a new steady state called ketosis in which practically all our energy comes from fat and that s when we really win big in the weight loss battle the above is a very simplified and hopefuly easy to digest version of what some diet books try to explain in hundreds of pages the hardest part especially at the beginning is reducing carbs the worst are starch rich foods pizza pasta bread etc  then processed foods with high sugar content sweet sodas no pulp juices etc this doesn t mean no carbs you may afford yourself carbs from time to time say a pizza once a week as it turns out an occasional lapse isn t enough to completely reverse any steady state however you need to make sure you consume much less carbs and less frequently than before in particular you must avoid binging on snacks like chips pizza doughnuts pasta and bread or drinking sugar rich drinks high fat i switched from milk to half and half and am considering heavy and unsweetened whipped cream it has less carbs lactose and more fat plus it tastes better eat avocados olive oil mayo coconut oil nuts i never worry about natural fat i eat as much fat as i want this is what makes it much easier to avoid carbs when i stuff myself with fat i feel much less hungry and miss the carbs less the body is very good at figuring this out i have too much fat in the blood so let s increase the amount of enzymes which break up fat and this makes me lose weight in the long run most importantly i always avoid any products labeled low fat or fat free the food industry usually replaces fat with sugar so it tastes better otherwise it tastes awful you ll often hear about bad vs good fat my take as long as it is natural it is ok the worst trans fat is fat that s artificially hydrogenated to increase shelf life by the food industry the less saturated fat is the better mono saturated plant liquid oil is the best then come the poly unsaturated fats and finally near saturated but not fully saturated fats that come from animals my buttery spread spectrum is margarine no butter ok earth balance no problem at any rate even the most saturated fat gets broken and depleted by the natural processes in the body a bit of exercise of course more is better but for many this may prove difficult i don t excercise too much i just bike to work and back about  min each way meaning  min and day  out of  days and week you can try walking the dog but walk faster  or zumba dance to music the trick is to find something that you don t find hard to do or find company to do it together then do a little bit of it every day longer fasting periods this is the  contributor to weight loss sleep longer stop eating as early as possible before going to sleep and start eating as late as possible after sleeping skip breakfast  after some time you won t feel hungry in the morning anymore after long periods of fasting the body chemistry adjusts it needs atp but there s a too low level of glucose in the blood the glycogen in the liver is fully consumed this takes about   days of low or no carbs so there s no other option but to start looking for other sources like stored fat this elevates the enzymes that help with breaking up fat and the krebs cycle reverses direction in the critical paths instead of transforming excess carbs into stored fat we break up stored fat for energy eat eggs they are a wonderful combo of fat and protein with no carbs at all i read an interview with a japanese woman who reached  years longevity md and one of her secrets was to eat eggs daily my favorite food is a scrambled egg with grilled onions onions are a bit high on carbs but too tasty to give up and olives eat slower and chew longer don t swallow just yet humans just like dogs tend to swallow too soon stop eating when you feel full there s about  min delay before your brain registers that you are full so don t over eat a nice   minute video of

547820, jquery templates is no longer in active development and has been superseded by jsrender functionality is a superset of the jquery templates feature set and brings many improvements the template tag syntax is similar rendering and compiling performance of jsrender is considerably better than jquery templates performance note this is the original official jquery templates plugin the project was maintained by the jquery team as an official jquery plugin since the jquery team has decided not to take this plugin past beta it has been returned to the principal developer s github account boris moore for more information on the history of jquery templates and the roadmap going forward see see vbeta   tag for released beta version requires jquery version    jquery templates contain markup with binding expressions template tags templates are applied to data objects or arrays and rendered into the html dom note that documentation for the jquery templates plugin is no longer maintained on the jquery documentation site an archive copy of the original documentation previously at api jquery com and category and plugins and templates and can be found for more background live versions of some of the demos from this repository can be found at and ul and p the following is a restoration of jquery s official documentation on tmpl as it was on  and  and  jquery is copyright  john resig render the specified html content as a template using the specified data version added    jquery tmpl template  data  options template the html markup or text to use as a template data the data to render this can be any javascript type including array or object options an optional map of user defined key value pairs extends the tmplitem data structure available to the template during rendering the jquery tmpl method is designed for chaining with appendto  prependto  insertafter or insertbefore as in the following example javascript tmpl li name and li  name john doe appendto target the template parameter can be any of the following a string containing markup an html element or jquery object that wraps an element whose content is to be used as the template a string corresponding to the name of a named template see jquery template and template a compiled template function see jquery template and template if data is an array the template is rendered once for each data item in the array if data is an object or if the data parameter is missing or null a single template item is rendered the return value is a jquery collection of elements made up of the rendered template items one for each data item in the array if the template contains only one top level element then there will be one element for each data item in the array to insert the rendered template items into the html dom the returned jquery collection should not be inserted directly into the dom but should be chained with appendto  prependto  insertafter or insertbefore  as in following example javascript tmpl mytemplate mydata appendto target see also tmpl the following example shows how to use jquery tmpl to render local data using a template provided as a string javascript var movies name the red violin  releaseyear   name eyes wide shut  releaseyear   name the inheritance  releaseyear  var markup li b name and b releaseyear and li and and compile the markup as a named template template movietemplate  markup and and render the template with the movies data and insert and and the rendered html under the movielist element tmpl movietemplate  movies appendto

render the data function showmovies data and and render the template with the movies data and insert and and the rendered html under the movielist element tmpl movietemplate  data appendto movielist you can get the markup for the template from inline markup in the page or from a string possibly computed or obtained remotely for an example of how to use inline markup see tmpl when a template is rendered the markup is first converted into a compiled template function every time tmpl markup  mydata appendto target is called the template is recompiled if the same template is to be used more than once for rendering data you should ensure that the compiled template is cached to cache the template when using markup that is obtained from a string rather than from inline markup in the page  use template name markup to create a named template for reuse see jquery template template tags such as the tag can used within jquery templates in addition to text and html markup to enable a number of scenarios such as composition of templates iteration over hierarchical data parameterization of template rendering etc template tags can render content based on the values of data item fields or template variables such as item corresponding to the template item  as well as expressions and function calls see the documentation topics for each template tag  each  if  else  html  tmpl and wrap each template item the result of rendering a data item with the template is associated with a tmplitem data structure which can be accessed using jquery tmplitem and tmplitem  or the item template variable any fields or anonomyous methods passed in with the options parameter of jquery tmpl will extend the tmplitem data structure and so be available to the template as in the following example javascript and more content item myvalue and li and and compile the markup as a named template template movietemplate  markup and and render the template with the movies data tmpl movietemplate

added pause and resume functionality  added repeat animation functionality  added friendly swift interface in separate framework   caanimations and uiview animations are extremely powerful but it is difficult to chain multiple animations together especially while changing anchor points furthermore complicated animations are difficult to read say i want to move myview  pixels to the right with spring and then change the background color with inward easing when the movement has finished objective c uiview animatewithduration   delay   usingspringwithdamping   initialspringvelocity   options  animations cgpoint newposition self myview frame origin newposition x and  self myview frame origin newposition completion bool finished uiview animatewithduration   delay   options uiviewanimationoptioncurveeasein animations self myview backgroundcolor uicolor purplecolor completion nil thats pretty gross huh with jhchainableanimations it is one line of code objective c jhchainableanimator animator jhchainableanimator alloc initwithview self myview animator movex  spring thenafter   makebackground uicolor purplecolor easein animate   there are a few ways you can add this framework to your project the objective c framework is called jhchainableanimations and the swift framework is called chainableanimations more notes on swift usage can be found here swift pod jhchainableanimations     then add the following objective c pod chainableanimations     then add the following import chainableanimations add the following to your cartfile github jhurray and jhchainableanimations    add the jhchainableanimations framework to your project add the chainableanimations framework to your project either clone the repo and manually add the files in jhchainableanimations and jhchainableanimations to create an instance of jhchainableanimator you must call the initwithview method objective c jhchainableanimator animator jhchainableanimator alloc initwithview self myview chainable properties like movex x must come between the view and the animate t function below is an example of how to double an objects size over the course of one second objective c animator makescale   animate   if you want to move the view while you scale it add another chainable property order is not important objective c animator makescale   movexy   animate   and and the same as animator movexy   makescale   animate   a full list of chainable properties can be found here chainables to chain animations seperate the chains with the thenafter t function below is an example of how to scale and object for   seconds and then move it for  second when that is done objective c animator makescale   thenafter   movexy   animate   to add an animation effect call the effect method after the chainable property you want it to apply to below is an example of scaling a view with a spring effect objective c animator makescale   spring animate   if you add  to the same chainable property the second will cancel the first out objective c animator makescale   bounce spring animate   and and the same as animator makescale   spring animate   a full list of animation effect properties can be found here effects to anchor your view call an achoring method at some point in an animation chain like effects calling one after another in the same chain will cancel the first out below is an example of rotating a view around different anchor points objective c animator rotatez  anchortopleft thenafter   rotatez  anchorcenter animate   and and animator rotatez  anchortopleft anchorcenter animator rotatez  anchorcenter a full list of anchor properties can be found here anchors to delay an animation call the wait t or delay t chainable property below is an example of moving a view after a delay of   seconds objective c animator movexy   wait   animate   and and the same as animator movexy   delay   animate   to run code after an animation finishes set the completionblock property of your animator or call the animatewithcompletion t completion function objective c animator makex  animatewithcompletion   nslog animation done is the same as objective c animator completionblock nslog animation done animator makex  animate   you can repeat an animation by replacing the thenafter time method with the repeat time count method this will repeat the previously defined animations objective c and and the animator will double its scale  times for   seconds each before it calls movexy and finishes the animation animator makescale   repeat    movexy   animate   you can repeat the last part of an animation by calling animatewithrepeat time count objective c and and the animator will double its scale then rotate by  degrees  times for  second each animator makescale   thenafter   rotate  animatewithrepeat    to pause the animation call the pause method on the animator when you call pause the current animation in the chain will complete but nothing beyod that will be executed you can use the ispaused and isanimating readonly properties to inspect state if an animation is paused but not stopped it will still evaluate as animating to resume in a paused state call the resume method on the animator to stop animation and clear state call the stop method on the animator objective c and and in this case the movex animation will execute but the movey will not and and if resume is called movey will be executed and and if stop is called nothing will be executed and the animator will get a fresh state animator movex  thenafter   movey  animate   animator pause you can hook into the different steps of the animation process by calling the preanimationblock block  animationblock block  and postanimationblock block methods all take a simple block void as an argument order of calling these in the animation chain does not matter objective c animator movex  preanimationblock nslog before the first animation thenafter   postanimationblock nslog after the second animation movey  animate   objective c uibezierpath path uibezierpath bezierpath path movetopoint self myview center path addlinetopoint cgpointmake   path

autolayout you should not mix these with other chainable properties objective c animatorforviewwithconstraints transformx  transformscale  animate   let animator chainableaniamtor view myview animator

118365403, a simple and well designed structure is essential for any deep learning project so after a lot of practice and contributing in tensorflow projects here s a tensorflow project template that combines simplcity  best practice for folder structure and good oop design the main idea is that there s much stuff you do every time you start your tensorflow project so wrapping all this shared stuff will help you to change just the core idea every time you start a new tensorflow project so here s a simple tensorflow template that help you get into your main project faster and just focus on your core model training etc in a nutshell in a nutshell in details in details project architecture project architecture folder structure folder structure main components main components models models trainer trainer data loader data loader logger logger configuration configuration main main future work future work contributing contributing acknowledgments acknowledgments in a nutshell here s how to use this template so for example assume you want to implement vgg model so you should do the following in models folder create a class named vgg that inherit the basemodel class python class vggmodel basemodel def init self config super vggmodel self init config call the buildmodel and initsaver functions self buildmodel self initsaver override these two functions buildmodel where you implement the vgg model and initsaver where you define a tensorflow saver then call them in the initalizer python def buildmodel self here you build the tensorflow graph of any model you want and also define the loss pass  def initsaver self here you initalize the tensorflow saver that will be used in saving the checkpoints self saver tf train saver maxtokeep self config maxtokeep in trainers folder create a vgg trainer that inherit from basetrain class python class vggtrainer basetrain def init self sess model data config logger super vggtrainer self init sess model data config logger override these two functions trainstep  trainepoch where you write the logic of the training process python def trainepoch self  implement the logic of epoch loop on the number of iterations in the config and call the train step add any summaries you want using the summary  pass def trainstep self  implement the logic of the train step run the tensorflow session return any metrics you need to summarize  pass in main file you create the session and instances of the following objects model  logger  datagenerator  trainer  and config python sess tf session create instance of the model you want model vggmodel config create your data generator data datagenerator config create tensorboard logger logger logger sess config pass the all these objects to the trainer object and start your training by calling trainer train python trainer vggtrainer sess model data config logger here you train your model trainer train you will find a template file and a simple example in the model and trainer folder that shows you how to try your first model simply project architecture  folder structure     base     basemodel py this file contains the abstract class of the model     basetrain py this file contains the abstract class of the trainer    model this folder contains any model of your project     examplemodel py    trainer this folder contains trainers of your project     exampletrainer py    mains here s the main s of your project you may need more than one main     examplemain py here s an example of main that is responsible for the whole pipeline    data loader     datagenerator py here s the datagenerator that is responsible for all data handling    utils    logger py    anyotherutilsyouneed  base model base model is an abstract class that must be inherited by any model you create the idea behind this is that there s much shared stuff between all models the base model contains save this function to save a checkpoint to the desk load this function to load a checkpoint from the desk curepoch globalstep counters these variables to keep track of the current epoch and global step initsaver an abstract function to initialize the saver used for saving and loading the checkpoint note override this function in the model you want to implement buildmodel here s an abstract function to define the model note override this function in the model you want to implement your model here s where you implement your model so you should create your model class and inherit the basemodel class override buildmodel where you write the tensorflow model you want override initsave where you create a tensorflow saver to use it to save and load checkpoint call the buildmodel and initsaver in the initializer  base trainer base trainer is an abstract class that just wrap the training process your trainer here s what you should implement in your trainer  create your trainer class and inherit the basetrainer class  override these two functions trainstep  trainepoch where you implement the training process of each step and each epoch this class is responsible for all data handling and processing and provide an easy interface that can be used by the trainer this class is responsible for the tensorboard summary in your trainer create a dictionary of all tensorflow variables you want to summarize then pass this dictionary to logger summarize this class also supports reporting to comet ml which allows you to see all your hyper params metrics graphs dependencies and more including real time metric add your api key in the configuration file configs and example json l for example cometapikey your key here this template also supports reporting to comet ml which allows you to see all your hyper params metrics graphs dependencies and more including real time metric add your api key in the configuration file configs and example json l for example cometapikey your key here here s how it looks after you start training you can also link your github repository to your comet ml project for full version control i use json as configuration method and then parse it so write all configs you want then parse it using utils and config and processconfig and pass this configuration object to all other objects here s where you combine all previous part  parse the config file  create a tensorflow session  create an instance of model  datagenerator and logger and parse the config to all of them  create an instance of trainer and pass all previous objects to it  now you can train your model by calling trainer train replace the data loader part with new tensorflow dataset api any kind of enhancement or contribution is welcomed
2471557, docblockr is a package for sublime text   sublime which makes writing documentation a breeze docblockr supports javascript including es  php  actionscript  haxe  coffeescript  typescript  java  apex  groovy  objective c  c  c and and and rust  open package control preferences package control  select package control install package  type docblockr into the search box and select the package to install it you can leave either of these things here issues pull requests are welcomed heartily but please read contributing md contrib first basically in this repo the main development branch is develop and the stable production branch is master please remember to base your branch from develop and issue the pull request back to that branch v     aug  fix deindentation bug with reparsing doc blocks v     jun  better handling of parser errors thanks to gerard roche v     jun  v     mar  properly handle the case when commas appear inside a type name in java added link to readme in the preferences menu v     mar  adds support for apex language thanks michacom fixes identifying multidimensional arrays in c and c and and fixes reformatting and reparsing docblocks in java adds options to disable opening an inline docblock with space jsdocsquickopeninline inline comment decoration jsdocsdecorate older history can be found in the history file history below are some examples of what the package does note that there are no keyboard shortcuts required to trigger these completions just type as normal and it happens for you pressing enter or tab after and or for coffee script yields a new line and closes the comment single asterisk comment blocks behave similarly however if the line directly afterwards contains a function definition then its name and parameters are parsed and some documentation is automatically added press kbd tab and kbd to move forward through the fields press kbd shift and kbd and kbd tab and kbd to move back through the fields if there are many arguments or long variable names it is sometimes useful to spread the arguments across multiple lines docblockr handles this situation too in languages which support type hinting typehinting or default values then those types are prefilled as the datatypes docblockr will try to make an intelligent guess about the return value of the function if the function name is or begins with set or add  then no return is inserted if the function name is or begins with is or has  then it is assumed to return a boolean in javascript if the function begins with an uppercase letter then it is assumed that the function is a class definition no return tag is added in php some of the magic methods magicmethods have their values prefilled construct  destruct  set  unset  wakeup have no return tag sleep returns an array tostring returns a string isset returns a bool in es javascript generator functions get a yield tag instead of return if the line following the docblock contains a variable declaration docblockr will try to determine the data type of the variable and insert that into the comment press kbd space and kbd or kbd shift and kbd and kbd enter and kbd after an opening and to insert an inline docblock docblockr will also try to determine the type of the variable from its name variables starting with is or has are assumed to be booleans and callback  cb  done  fn  and next are assumed to be functions if you use your own variable naming system e g hungarian notation booleans all start with b  arrays start with arr  you can define these rules yourself use the jsdocsnotationmap setting example jsdocsnotationmap  prefix b  and a prefix matches only if followed by an underscore or a z and type bool and translates to boolean in javascript bool in php and   regex tbl rr ow  and any arbitrary regex to test against the variable name and type tablerow and you can add your own types and  the notation map can also be used to add arbitrary tags according to your own code conventions for example if your conventions state that functions beginning with an underscore are private you could add this to the jsdocsnotationmap prefix   tags private pressing enter inside a docblock will automatically insert a leading asterisk and maintain your indentation this applies to docblock comments and like this and as well as inline double slash comments and and like this in either case you can press shift and enter to stop the automatic extension oftentimes when documenting a parameter or adding a description to a tag your description will cover multiple lines if the line you are on is directly following a tag line pressing kbd tab and kbd will move the indentation to the correct position if you write a double slash comment and then press ctrl and enter  docblockr will decorate that line for you and and foo bar baz ctrl and enter becomes and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and foo bar baz and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and this can be disabled by changing the jsdocsdecorate setting to false sometimes you ll perform some action which clears the fields sections of text which you can navigate through using kbd tab and kbd this leaves you with a number of placeholders in the docblock with no easy way to jump to them with docblockr you can reparse a comment and reactivate the fields by pressing the hotkey alt and shift and tab in os x or linux or alt and w in windows inside a comment block hit alt and q to wrap the lines to make them fit within your rulers if you would like subsequent lines in a paragraph to be indented you can adjust the jsdocsindentationspacessamepara setting for example a value of  might look like this duis sed arcu non tellus eleifend ullamcorper quis non erat curabitur metus elit ultrices et tristique a blandit at justo param string foo lorem ipsum dolor sit amet param number bar nullam fringilla feugiat pretium quisque consectetur risus eu pellentesque tincidunt nulla ipsum imperdiet massa sit amet adipiscing dolor return type finally typing inside a docblock will show a completion list for all tags supported by jsdoc jsdoc  the google closure compiler closure  yuidoc yui or phpdoc phpdoc extra help is provided for each of these tags by prefilling the arguments each expects pressing kbd tab and kbd will move the cursor to the next argument you can access the configuration settings by selecting preferences package settings docblockr the jsdocs prefix is a legacy from days gone by jsdocsindentationspaces number the number of spaces to indent after the leading asterisk and and jsdocsindentationspaces  and foo and and and jsdocsindentationspaces  and foo and jsdocsaligntags string whether the words following the tags should align possible values are no  shallow and deep for backwards compatibility false is equivalent to no  true is equivalent to shallow shallow will align only the first words after the tag eg param mycustomclass myvariable desc return string foo desc property number blahblah desc deep will align each component of the tags eg param mycustomclass myvariable desc return string foo desc property number blahblah desc jsdocsextratags array string an array of strings each representing extra boilerplate comments to add to functions these can also include arbitrary text not just tags and and jsdocsextratags this is a cool function  author nickf  version  version and enter function foo x and foo description this is a cool function author nickf version version param type x description return type and function foo x basic variable substitution is supported here for the variables date and datetime  wrapped in double curly brackets and and jsdocsextratags date date  anotherdate datetime and enter function foo and foo description date    datetime   t   and  return type and jsdocsextratagsgoafter boolean if true the extra tags are placed at the end of the block after param and return default false jsdocsextenddoubleslash boolean whether double slash comments should be extended an example of this feature is described above default true jsdocsdeepindent boolean whether pressing tab at the start of a line in docblock should indent to match the previous line s description field an example of this feature is described above default true jsdocsnotationmap array an array of notation objects each notation object must define either a prefix or a regex property and a type property jsdocsreturntag string the text which should be used for a return tag by default return is used however this can be changed to returns if you use that style jsdocsspacerbetweensections boolean and string if true then extra blank lines are inserted between the sections of the docblock if set to afterdescription then a spacer will only be added between the description and the first tag default false jsdocsindentationspacessamepara number described above in the reformatting paragraphs section default  jsdocsautoaddmethodtag boolean add a method tag to docblocks of functions default false jsdocssimplemode boolean if true docblockr won t add a template when creating a doc block before a function or variable useful if you don t want to write javadoc style but still want your editor to help when writing block comments default false jsdocslowercaseprimitives boolean if true primitive data types are added in lower case eg number instead of number default false jsdocsshortprimitives boolean if true the primitives boolean and integer are shortened to bool and int default false jsdocsnewlineafterblock boolean if true an extra line break is added after the end of a docblock to separate it from the code default false jsdocsparamname boolean if true the name of a function parameter is added to the template if false it is omitted default true jsdocsdecorate boolean if false disable decoration of single line comments

45485565, meteor is awesome but after  years it s starting to show its age this project is designed to showcase the exact same functionality as meteor but without the monolithic structure it trades a little simplicity for a lot of flexibility some of my chief complaints with meteor built on node   and that ain t changing anytime soon build system doesn t allow for code splitting the opposite in fact global scope namespacing doesn t count goes oprah christmas special with websockets not every person and page needs one can t handle css modules css is all handled behind the scenes tied to mongodb for official support and problem and meteor s solution and my solution and result and and and and and and and server and node    and node  and faster maintained not a dinosaur and and brew install rethinkdb make sure you are using webpack  x not a v installed globally rethinkdb in second terminal window git clone this repo cd meatier npm install npm run quickstart npm start rebuilds the client code in memory uses hot module reload so you can develop super fast on my  mba an initial build takes about  seconds and updates usually take ms npm run prod if you edit any client or universal files run npm run bs to rebuild serve the bundle this mode is great because you can make changes to the server without having to recompile the client code that means you only wait for the server to restart game changer all tables are managed in and src and server and setupdb js just add your tables indices to that file and rerun a standard orm would check for tables ensure indices at least once per build doing it this way keeps your build times down when the page is opened a basic html layout is sent to the client along with a stringified redux store and a request for the common chunk of the js the client then injects the redux store router to create the page the redux devtools logger are also loaded so you track your every state changing action the routes are loaded async check your networks tab in chrome devtools and you ll see funny js files load now again if this isn t crazy amazing to you then go away builds the website saves it to the build folder maps the styles to the components but uses the prerendered css from the server config below separates the vendor packages and the app packages for a super quick cachable second visit creates a webpack manifest to enable longterm caching eg can push new vendor js without pushing a new app js optimizes the number of chunks sometimes it s better to have the modules of  routes in the same chunk if they re small a webpack config builds the entire contents of the routes on the server side this is required because node doesn t know how to require css when a request is sent to the server react router matches the url to the correct route sends it to the client any browser dependency is ignored uglified away to test this disable javascript in the browser you ll see the site css loads without a fouc when the page loads it checks your localstorage for meatier token will automatically log you in if the token is legit if not just head to the sign up page the sign up page uses redux form which handles all errors schema validation and submissions your credentials are set as variables in a graphql mutation sent to the graphql endpoint and a user document similar to meteor s and authtoken is returned to your state the kanban app requires a login websocket so when you enter your token will be used to authenticate a websocket that token is stored on the server so it is only sent during the handshake very similar to ddp socket state is managed by redux socket cluster  just clicking socket in the devtools let s you explore its current state when you enter the route reducers are lazily loaded to the redux store and the redux optimistic ui reducer enhancer is applied to the store to enable an optimistic ui to work it requires some middleware that scans each redux action for an isoptimistic prop and reverts actions that fail server side when the kanban component loads it subscribes to lanes notes  which starts your personalized changefeed when you do something that changes the persisted state eg add a kanban lane that action is executed optimistically on the client emitted to the server where it is validated sent to the database the database then emits a changefeed doc to all subscribed viewers since the db doesn t know which client made the mutation it always sends a changefeed to the server the server is smart enough to ignore sending that document back to the originator but it does send an acknowledgement the kanban lane titles notes are really basic you click them they turn into input fields the notes can be dragged from lane to lane this is to showcase a local state change that doesn t affect the persisted state when the note is dropped to its new location the change is persisted i don t know of any place that hosts rethinkdb for free so here s a gif pull requests welcomed use the gitter for any questions no donations necessary but if you know of any jobs that ll let me move back to san diego let me know wink use the redux devtools chrome extension update just about all the deps make deployments more configurable deployment strategy coming soon upgraded to redux simple router    now you can do cool things like time travel through routes move auth mutations to graphql changefeeds still go through ws subs make the rest of the state auth immutable break out auth landing page kanban page and admin into  separate modules in the folder hierarchy
5289665, launchrocket  of particular note is the ability to run some services as root with homebrew most services can simply run as the current user and this is the desired behavior for a development environment however some services dnsmasq require being bound to privileged ports and others nginx apache don t require it but might in some circumstances for example many times it s just easier to run apache on port  and  than to deal with code that might not like port numbers in the urls i recommend you only run things as root if you absolutely must to get them working properly launchrocke screenshot and screenshots and launchrocket png green and yellow and red status indicators green launchctl reports process is running yellow launchrocket is current executing or waiting on a start and stop command red launchctl reports process is not running start and stop buttons dynamically updates state based on running state of service as root option checking this will cause launchrocket to use root privileges to access launchctl checking this will not restart a running service automatically as root launchrocket will prompt you to authenticate and elevate privileges we ask for credentials as seldom as possible however when launchrocket loads it checks the current status of every service it s tracking this means that if you have services running as root it will prompt you for credentials immediately on load as an unprivileged account cannot even list launchd services run by a privileged one preferences file launchrocket stores a preferences file in and library and preferences and com joshbutts launchrocket plist installing  requirements os x   or above gatekeeper must be set to allow all apps to run see issues  and  the binary release should work on mac osx    and above and might even work on older versions though it has not been tested on those the latest builds are compiled on    and targeted at   in xcode direct download homebrew brew cask install launchrocket further information about running as root  launchrocket uses an applescript helper to obtain root privileges this is a hacky way of accomplishing it but it avoids having to actually install a privileged helper outside of the prefpane bundle with smjobbless and is way simpler this is not the most secure approach and does not use code signing as such it is possible that if launchrocket s applescript helper has cached your privileged authorization another application maliciously address that helper and request it execute other commands with root level privileges i considered this a reasonable tradeoff between security usability and code simplicity closing system preferences or simply switching back to the main view will terminate the helper and drop privileges if you don t have anything running as root no programs can request that the helper execute code with privilieges without triggering a credential prompt contributing  found a bug file an issue and i ll take a look pull requests are welcome if you d like to chat about a feature or issue i can sometimes be found in launchrocket on freenode

15324383, a simple and elegant solution to displaying hierarchical tree structures i e a tree view while leveraging the best that twitter bootstrap has to offer where provided these are the actual versions bootstrap treeview has been tested against you can install using bower recommended javascript bower install bootstrap treeview or using npm javascript npm install bootstrap treeview add the following resources for the bootstrap treeview to function correctly link href bootstrap css rel stylesheet the component will bind to any existing dom element basic usage may look something like this javascript function gettree and and some logic to retrieve or generate tree structure return data tree treeview data gettree in order to define the hierarchical structure needed for the tree it s necessary to provide a nested array of javascript objects javascript var tree text parent   nodes text child   nodes  text grandchild    text grandchild    text child  text parent  text parent  text parent  text parent  at the lowest level a tree node is a represented as a simple javascript object this one required property text will build you a tree javascript text node  if you want to do more here s the full node specification javascript text node   icon glyphicon glyphicon stop  selectedicon glyphicon glyphicon stop  color   backcolor ffffff  href node   selectable true state checked true disabled true expanded true selected true tags available  nodes the following properties are defined to allow node level overrides such as node specific icons colours and tags string mandatory the text value displayed for a given tree node typically to the right of the nodes icon string optional the icon displayed on a given node typically to the left of the text by providing the base class you retain full control over the icons used if you want to use your own then just add your class to this icon field string optional the icon displayed on a given node when selected typically to the left of the text string optional the foreground color used on a given node overrides global color option string optional the background color used on a given node overrides global color option string optional used in conjunction with global enablelinks option to specify anchor tag url on a given node boolean default true whether or not a node is selectable in the tree false indicates the node should act as an expansion heading and will not fire selection events object optional describes a node s initial state boolean default false whether or not a node is checked represented by a checkbox style glyphicon boolean default false whether or not a node is disabled not selectable expandable or checkable boolean default false whether or not a node is expanded i e open takes precedence over global option levels boolean default false whether or not a node is selected array of strings optional you can extend the node object by adding any number of additional key value pairs that you require for your application remember this is the object which will be passed around during selection events options allow you to customise the treeview s default appearance and behaviour they are passed to the plugin on initialization as an object javascript and and example initializing the treeview and and expanded to  levels and and with a background color of green tree treeview data data and and data is not optional levels  backcolor green you can pass a new options object to the treeview at any time but this will have the effect of re initializing the treeview the following is a list of all available options array of objects no default expects data this is the core data to be displayed by the tree view sets the default background color used by all nodes except when overridden on a per node basis in data sets the border color for the component set showborder to false if you don t want a visible border sets the icon to be as a checked checkbox used in conjunction with showcheckbox sets the icon to be used on a collapsible tree node sets the default foreground color used by all nodes except when overridden on a per node basis in data sets the icon to be used on a tree node with no child nodes boolean default false whether or not to present node text as a hyperlink the href value of which must be provided in the data structure on a per node basis sets the icon to be used on an expandable tree node boolean default true whether or not to highlight search results boolean default true whether or not to highlight the selected node integer default  sets the number of hierarchical levels deep the tree will be expanded to by default boolean default false whether or not multiple nodes can be selected at the same time sets the default icon to be used on all nodes except when overridden on a per node basis in data sets the default background color activated when the users cursor hovers over a node sets the default icon to be used on all selected nodes except when overridden on a per node basis in data sets the background color of the selected node sets the foreground color of the selected node sets the background color of the selected node sets the foreground color of the selected node boolean default true whether or not to display a border around nodes boolean default false whether or not to display checkboxes on nodes boolean default true whether or not to display a nodes icon boolean default false whether or not to display tags to the right of each node the values of which must be provided in the data structure on a per node basis sets the icon to be as an unchecked checkbox used in conjunction with showcheckbox methods provide a way of interacting with the plugin programmatically for example expanding a node is possible via the expandnode method you can invoke methods in one of two ways using either the plugin s wrapper works as a proxy for accessing the underlying methods javascript tree treeview methodname  args limitation multiple arguments must be passed as an array of arguments you can get an instance of the treeview using one of the two following methods javascript and and this special method returns an instance of the treeview tree treeview true methodname args and and the instance is also saved in the dom elements data and and and accessible using the plugin s id treeview tree data treeview methodname args a better approach if you plan a lot of interaction the following is a list of all available methods checks all tree nodes javascript tree treeview checkall  silent true triggers

17341429, matchheight makes the height of all selected elements exactly equal match the heights for groups of elements automatically use the maximum height or define a specific target element anywhere on the page and anywhere in the dom responsive updates on window resize row aware handles floating elements and wrapping accounts for box sizing and mixed padding  margin  border values handles images and other media updates after loading supports hidden or none visible elements e g those inside tab controls throttled to balance performance and smoothness easily removed when needed maintain scroll position data attributes api callback events unit tests module loader support tested in ie and  chrome firefox safari android ios see how others are using jquery matchheight js bower install matchheight npm install jquery match height function item matchheight options where options is an optional parameter see below for a description of the available options and defaults the above example will set all selected elements with the class item to the height of the tallest if the items are on multiple rows the items of each row will be set to the tallest of that row see byrow option also see the data api data api below for a simple alternative inline usage the default options are byrow true property height  target null remove false byrow is true or false to enable row detection property is the css property name to set e g height or min height target is an optional element to use instead of the element with maximum height remove is true or false to remove previous bindings instead of applying new ones use the data attribute data mh group name where group name is an arbitrary string to identify which elements should be considered as a group all elements with the same group name will be set to the same height when the page is loaded regardless of their position in the dom without any extra code required note that byrow will be enabled when using the data api if you don t want this or require other options then use the alternative method above there are some additional functions and properties you should know about fn matchheight update if you need to manually trigger an update of all currently set groups for example if you ve modified some content you can toggle row detection by setting the byrow option which defaults to true it s also possible to use the row detection function at any time fn matchheight rows item item matchheight remove true this will remove all bindings for the selected elements from all groups function item matchheight target sidebar  will set all selected elements to the height of the first item with class sidebar item matchheight property min height this will set the min height property instead of the height property since matchheight automatically handles updating the layout after certain window events you can supply functions as global callbacks if you need to be notified fn matchheight beforeupdate function event groups and and do something before any updates are applied fn matchheight afterupdate function event groups and and do something after all updates are applied where event a jquery event object e g load  resize  orientationchange and groups is a reference to fn matchheight groups see below fn matchheight apply elements options use the apply function directly if you wish to avoid the automatic update functionality fn matchheight throttle  by default the update method is throttled to execute at a maximum rate of once every ms decreasing the above throttle property will update your layout quicker appearing smoother during resize at the expense of performance if you experience lagging or freezing during resize you should increase the throttle property fn matchheight maintainscroll true under certain conditions where the size of the page is dynamically changing such as during resize or when adding new elements browser bugs cause the page scroll position to change unexpectedly if you are observing this behaviour use the above line to automatically attempt to force scroll position to be maintained approximately this is a global setting and by default it is false fn matchheight groups the array that contains all element groups that have had matchheight applied used internally for automatically updating on resize events but you may modify this array if you need to manually access any groups e g if you re deleting elements if you wish to contribute functionality to this project you are encouraged to add new tests following the same conventions exports config user username  key key you should ensure that there are no transitions or other animations that will delay the height changes of the elements you are matching including any transition all rules otherwise the plugin will produce unexpected results as animations can t be accounted for if you change the content inside an element that has had matchheight applied then you must manually call fn matchheight update afterwards this will update of all currently set equal heights groups this license is also supplied with the release and source code

9311021, a pure javascript cors alternative no server configuration required just add a proxy html on the domain you wish to communicate with this will work seamlessly with any library library agnostic cross domain xhr just magically works no need to modify the server code easy xhr access to file servers proxy html files slaves may white list domains white list paths using regular expressions e g only allow api calls and and api and html all except ie and  as they don t have postmessage note it s important to include xdomain before any other library when xdomain loads xhook replaces the current window xmlhttprequest so if another library saves a reference to the original window xmlhttprequest and uses that xhook won t be able to intercept those requests  html doctype html html js and and do some vanilla xhr var xhr new xmlhttprequest xhr onreadystatechange function e if xhr readystate  console log got result  xhr responsetext xhr send and and or if we are using jquery console log got result  data tip if you enjoy being standards compliant you can also use data master and data slave attributes  the following two snippets are equivalent xdomain masters and script so we can then add more masters or slaves by simply including them in the object  see api below will initialize as a master each of the slaves must be defined as origin proxy file the slaves object is used as a list slaves to force one proxy file per origin the quick usage step  above is equivalent to xdomain slaves and script will initialize as a slave each of the masters must be defined as origin path origin and path are converted to a regular expression by escaping all non alphanumeric chars then converting into and finally wrapping it with and path can also be a regexp literal requests that do not match both the origin and the path regular expressions will be blocked so you could use the following proxy html to allow all subdomains of example com which is equivalent to xdomain masters and script where and api and json becomes the regexp and and api and json and therefore you could allow all domains with the following proxy html when true  xdomain will log actions to console number of milliseconds until xdomains gives up waiting for an iframe to respond event may be log  warn or timeout when listening for log and warn events handler with contain the message as the first parameter the timeout event fires when an iframe exeeds the xdomain timeout time limit warning warning chrome and possibly other browsers appear to be blocking access to the iframe s document cookie property this means slave cookie s are no longer supported in some browsers when withcredentials is set to true for a given request the cookies of the master and slave are sent to the server using these names if one is set to null  it will not be sent and and defaults xdomain cookies master master cookie slave slave cookie note if you use cookie as your cookie name it will be removed by browsers with disable rd party cookies switched on this includes all safari users and many others who purposefully enable it   xdomain will create an iframe on the master to the slave s proxy  master will communicate to slave iframe using postmessage  slave will create xhrs on behalf of master then return the results use the html document type doctype html to prevent your page from going into quirks mode if you don t do this xdomain will warn you about the missing json and and or postmessage globals and will exit q but i love cors a you shouldn t you should use xdomain because ie uses a different api xdomainrequest for cors xdomain normalizes this silliness xdomainrequest also has many restrictions requests must be get or post requests must use the same protocol as the page http http requests only emit progress  timeout and error requests may only use the content type header on a restful json api server cors will generate superfluous traffic by sending a preflight options request preceding various types of requests not everyone is able to modify http headers on the server but most can upload a proxy html file google also uses iframes as postmessage proxies instead of cors in its google api js sdk html iframe name oauthrelay id oauthrelay q xdomain is interfering with another library so there should be no differences if there is a difference create an issue note however one purposeful difference affects some libraries under ie many use the presence of withcredentials in new xmlhttprequest to determine if the browser supports cors cors thereby allowing xdomain to function seamlessly in ie however this fix is detrimental to other libraries like mixpanel fb sdk intercom as they will incorrectly attempt cors on domains which don t have a proxy html so if you are using any of these libraries which implement their own cors workarounds you can do the following to manually disable defining withcredentials and manually reenable cors on jquery and and fix trackers xhook addwithcredentials false and and fix jquery cors jquery support cors true note in newer browsers xhook addwithcredentials has no effect as they already support withcredentials q xdomain works for a few requests and then it stops a most likely the slave iframe was removed this is often due to libraries like turbolinks q in ie i m getting an access denied error a this is error occurs when ie attempts a cors request read on q the browser is still sending cors requests a double check your slaves configuration against the examples if your slaves configuration is correct double check that you re including xdomain before window xmlhttprequest is referenced anywhere the safest way to fix it is to include xdomain first  it has no dependencies it only modifies window xmlhttprequest q the script is loads but the quick start steps don t work a xdomain only searches the script tags for master and slave attributes if they have xdomain in the src so if you ve renamed or embedded xdomain you ll need to use the api api in order to insert your masters and slaves q it s still not working a enable xdomain debug true or add a debug true attribute to the script tag on both the master and the slave and copy the console logs to a new issue if possible please provide a live example demonstrating your issue    removed coffeescript restructured with es and common js use parcel as bundler

22284914, this project is not maintained anymore and is archived feel free to fork and thanks to everyone for their valuable feedback and contributions structs contains various utilities to work with go golang structs it was initially used by me to convert a struct into a map string interface with time i ve added other utilities for structs it s basically a high level package based on primitives from the reflect package feel free to add new functions or improve the existing code go get github com and fatih and structs just like the standard lib strings  bytes and co packages structs has many global functions to manipulate or organize your struct data lets define and declare a struct type server struct name string json nameomitempty id int enabled bool users string and and not exported http server and and embedded server server name gopher  id  enabled true and and convert a struct to a map string interface and and name gopher  id  enabled true m structs map server and and convert the values of a struct to a interface and and gopher   true v structs values server and and convert the names of a struct to a string and and see names methods for more info about fields n structs names server and and convert the values of a struct to a field and and see field methods for more info about fields f structs fields server and and return the struct name server n structs name server and and check if any field of a struct is initialized or not h structs haszero server and and check if all fields of a struct is initialized or not z structs iszero server and and check if server is a struct or a pointer to struct i structs isstruct server the structs functions can be also used as independent methods by creating a new structs struct this is handy if you want to have more control over the structs such as retrieving a single field and and create a new struct type s structs new server m s map and and get a map string interface v s values and and get a interface f s fields and and get a field n s names and and get a string f s field name and and get a field based on the given field name f ok s fieldok name and and get a field based on the given field name n s name and and get the struct name h s haszero and and check if any field is uninitialized z s iszero and and check if all fields are uninitialized we can easily examine a single field for more detail below you can see how we get and interact with various field methods s structs new server and and get the field struct for the name field name s field name and and get the underlying value value gopher value name value string and and set the field s value name set another gopher and and get the field s kind kind string name kind and and check if the field is exported or not if name isexported fmt println name field is exported and and check if the value is a zero value such as for string  for int if name iszero fmt println name is initialized and and check if the field is an anonymous embedded field if name isembedded fmt println name is not an embedded field and and get the field s tag value for tag name json  tag value nameomitempty tagvalue name tag json nested structs are supported too addrfield s field server field addr and and get the value for addr a addrfield value string and and or get all fields httpserver s field server fields we can also get a slice of fields from the struct type to iterate over all fields this is handy if you wish to examine all fields s structs new server for  f range s fields fmt printf field name and v n  f name if f isexported fmt printf value and v n  f value fmt printf is zero and v n  f iszero the mit license mit see license md for more details

specify the type of data to expect from the server reqwest uses type jquery also can also take a space separated list of data types to specify the request response and response conversion types but reqwest uses the type parameter to infer the response type and leaves conversion up to you reqwest also takes optional jsonpcallback and jsonpcallbackname options to specify the callback query string key and the callback function name respectively while jquery uses jsonp and jsonpcallback for these same options but fear not if you must work the jquery and zepto way then reqwest has a wrapper that

6515538, part ii of a step by step reasoned porting of the official react tutorial  to reagent  part i of a step by step reasoned porting of the official react tutorial  to reagent  step by step guide for publishing a library to clojars repository by using boot attention note i m in the process of publishing the second edition  of the series the main difference from the first edition  regards the use of the boot  build tool instead of leiningen  this second edition is still a draft version and you should be forgiving if you find errors typos or even bugs in the code warning note for windows users at the moment boot does not run on ms windows less than  if this is your case to be able to follow the modern cljs series you can use use a modern clojurescript modern cljs is a series of tutorials that guide you in creating and running clojurescript  cljs projects cljs is a compiler for the clojure programming language that targets javascript it emits javascript code which runs in web browsers and other client side or server side javascript interpreters e g nodejs  these tutorials require that you have some prior programming experience they assume you ve gotten your hands dirty by trying a little clojure even if you re not proficient in it yet it will also be quite helpful if you have some experience programming for the web using html javascript and the browser dom if you don t know anything about clojure or about lisp  i recommend you learn a little bit before starting these tutorials there are plenty of outstanding resources on clojure that are freely available on the internet and you can t overestimate the benefit of reading a book on clojure or another lisp dialect to your value as a programmer here are some book recommendations clojure programming  written by three of the heroes of clojure it contains everything you need to know about clojure and its ecosystem programming clojure  written by another legendary clojure developer it s the easiest path to learning clojure the joy of clojure  the title speaks by itself a must read clojurescript rationale  and clojurescript quick start  clojurescript up and running  at the moment it s the only published book on clojurescript the book is a bit outdated since clojurescript is evolving quickly it s brief and useful especially if you want to integrate with external javascript libraries sicp structure and interpretation of computer programs  this is the best programming book i ve read in my very long career it uses scheme and racket  a lisp dialect rather than clojure and is available online   in print   or in a lecture series  on lisp  if you want to learn about macros this is the place to start it uses common lisp a lisp dialect rather than clojure many people worry about which operating system and editor and ide are best for developing in clojure and clojurescript i personally use mac os x debian and ubuntu i use emacs as an editor because i m an old timer nix  and emacs are the os and editor i know best that being said in this series of tutorials you re not going to find any suggestions or reference to operating systems or editors use whatever tools you already have and know i have too much respect for people developing ide and plugins for clojure and cljs to say that one is better than another and you don t want to combine learning a new programming language with trying to learn a new programming environment note if you are interested in learning more about emacs here are some resources to help get you started you will need to have git  and java  installed and you ll need some familiarity with the basics of git  community created clojure documentation sites that you may find helpful are libraries and tools for clj and cljs you might wonder why this tutorial series is named modern cljs when clojurescript is so recent i started this series in  while trying to port a few examples from the modern javascript develop and design  book to clojurescript and now it s too late to change as said this is the second edition  of the series and is based on the boot  build tool i m not going to update or support the first edition  of the series which was based on the leiningen  build tool this series of tutorials guides you in creating and running simple cljs projects the bulk of the series follows the progressive enhancement of a single project while working through the tutorials i strongly suggest you start at tutorial  and type in all the code for each tutorial yourself in my experience this is the the best approach if you re not already very fluent with the programming language create and configure a very basic cljs project approach as close as possible the bret victor immediate feedback principle to build a very interactive development environment automate the launching of the boot command to approach the immediate feedback development environment ifde have some fun with cljs form validation by porting the javascript login form example from modern javascript develop and design  to cljs use the domina library  to make our login form validation more clojure ish investigate and find two different ways to solve an issue from the last tutorial use domina events for a more clojure ish approach to handling dom events programmatically manipulate dom elements in response to dom events use ajax to let the cljs client side code communicate with the server apply domina events to the login form example from the th tutorial  explore the highest html and deepest clojure on the server layers of the login form example from the previous tutorial  respect the don t repeat yourself dry principle  by sharing validators between the client side cljs and the server side clojure set the stage for unit testing by learning about the enlive template sytem and starting the shopping calculator example use code refactoring to satisfy the dry principle  and to solve a cyclic namespaces dependency problem add validators to the shoppingform  and do some unit testing configure a development environment that simultaneously satisfy in a single jvm the immediate feedback principle by bret victor and the test driven development tdd  make the test driven development  environment more customizable integrate validators into a web form in such a way that the user will be notified with the corresponding help messages when they enter invalid values in the form complete the client side form validation by exploiting the tdd  environment augmented with clj and cljs repls explain how to make a library compliant with the new

78433294, i hoped to find the opportunity to continue developing ok log after the spike of its creation unfortunately despite effort no such opportunity presented itself please look at ok log for inspiration and consider using the maintained projects that came from it ok log is a distributed and co rdination free log management system for big ol clusters it s an on prem solution that s designed to be a sort of building block easy to understand easy to operate and easy to extend you may consider ok log if you re tailing your logs manually find it annoying and want to aggregate them without a lot of fuss you re using a hosted solution like loggly and want to move logs on prem you re using elasticsearch but find it unreliable difficult to operate or don t use many of its features you re using a custom log pipeline with e g fluentd or logstash and having performance problems you just wanna like grep your logs  why is this all so complicated ok log is distributed as a single statically linked binary for a variety of target architectures oklog ingeststore store segment replication factor  and myservice and oklog forward localhost oklog query from m q hello       hello world if you have relatively small log volume you can deploy a cluster of identical ingeststore nodes by default the replication factor is  so you need at least  nodes use the cluster flag to specify a routable ip address or hostname for each node to advertise itself on and let each node know about at least one other node with the peer flag foo oklog ingeststore cluster foo peer foo peer bar peer baz bar oklog ingeststore cluster bar peer foo peer bar peer baz baz oklog ingeststore cluster baz peer foo peer bar peer baz to grow the cluster just add a new node and tell it about at least one other node via the peer flag optionally you can run the rebalance tool todo to redistribute the data over the new topology to shrink the cluster just kill nodes fewer than the replication factor and run the repair tool todo to re replicate lost records all configuration is done via commandline flags you can change things like the log retention period default d  the target segment file size default mb  and maximum time age of various stages of the logging pipeline most defaults should be sane but you should always audit for your environment if you have relatively large log volume you can split the ingest and store query responsibilities ingest nodes make lots of sequential writes and benefit from fast disks and moderate cpu store nodes make lots of random reads and writes and benefit from large disks and lots of memory both ingest and store nodes join the same cluster so provide them with the same set of peers ingest oklog ingest cluster     peer ingest oklog ingest cluster     peer store oklog store cluster     peer store oklog store cluster     peer store oklog store cluster     peer to add more raw ingest capacity add more ingest nodes to the cluster to add more storage or query capacity add more store nodes also make sure you have enough store nodes to consume from the ingest nodes without backing up the forwarder is basically just netcat with some reconnect logic pipe the stdout and stderr of your service to the forwarder configured to talk to your ingesters and myservice and oklog forward ingest ingest ok log integrates in a straightforward way with runtimes like docker and kubernetes querying is an http get to and query on any of the store nodes ok log comes with a query tool to make it easier to play with one good thing is to first use the stats flag to refine your query when you re satisfied it s sufficiently constrained drop stats to get results oklog query from h to h q myservice warn and error regex oklog query from h q and api and v and login remoteaddr       path and api and v and login  method post  statuscode  remoteaddr       path and api and v and login  method post  statuscode  remoteaddr       path and api and v and login  method post  statuscode  remoteaddr       path and api and v and login  method post  statuscode  oklog query from h q and api and v and login and jq and select statuscode  remoteaddr       path and api and v and login  method post  statuscode  ok log ships with a basic ui for making queries you can access it on any store or ingeststore node on the public api port default   path and ui

can avoid it with some efforts most of the data presented in your page once rendered are immutable so you shouldn t keep watching them for changes for instance take a look to this snippet li ng repeat person in persons angular internally creates a watch for each ng directive in order to keep the data up to date so in this example just for displaying few info it creates  and  ngrepeatwatch watchers per person  even if the person is supposed to remain the same once shown iterate this amount for each person and you can have an idea about how easy is to reach  watchers now if you need it because those data could change while you show the page or are bound to some models it s ok but most of the time they are static data that don t change once rendered this is where bindonce can really help you the above example done with bindonce li bindonce ng repeat person in persons now this example uses  watches per person and renders exactly the same result as the above that uses ng angular still uses  watcher for ngrepeatwatch let s take a look at the follow snippet to better understand the concept span my custom set text person firstname and span span my custom set text person lastname and span angular module testapp  directive mycustomsettext  function return link function scope elem attr ctrl elem text scope eval attr mycustomsettext and script this basic directive works as expected it renders the person data without using any watchers however if person is not yet available inside the scope when the page is loaded say we get person via http or via resource  the directive is useless scope eval attr mycustomsettext simply renders nothing and exits here is how we can solve this issue with bindonce span bo text person firstname and span span bo text person lastname and span bindonce person does the trick any bo attribute belonging to bindonce waits until the parent bindonce somedata is validated and then renders its content once the scope contains the value person then each bo child gets filled with the proper values in order to accomplish this task bindonce uses just one temporary watcher no matters how many children need to be rendered as soon as it gets person the watcher is promptly removed if the scope already contains the data bindonce is looking for then it doesn t create the temporary watcher and simply starts rendering its children you may have noticed that the first example didn t assign any value to the bindonce attribute li bindonce ng repeat person in persons when used with ng repeat bindonce doesn t need to check if person is defined because ng repeat creates the directives only when person exists you could be more explicit li bindonce person ng repeat person in persons  however assigning a value to bindonce in an ng repeat won t make any difference some directives ng href ng src use interpolation ie ng href and profile and user profileid both ng href and ng src have the bo equivalent directives bo href i and bo src i pay attention to the i  it stands for interpolate as expected they don t use watchers however angular creates one watcher per interpolation for instance bo href i and profile and user profileid sets the element s href once  as expected but angular keeps a watcher active on user profileid even if bo href i doesn t use it that s why by default the bo href doesn t use interpolation or watchers the above equivalent with  watchers would be bo href and profile and and user profileid nevertheless bo href i and bo src i are still maintained for compatibility reasons almost every bo directive replace the equivalent ng and works in the same ways except it is evaluated once consequentially you can use any valid angular expression including filters this is an example how to use a filter span bo bind person bill and currency usd and span and directive and description and example and and and and and and bo if condition and equivalent to ng if but doesn t use watchers and any bo if person ispublic and any and and bo show condition and equivalent to ng show but doesn t use watchers and any bo show person ispublic and any and and bo hide condition and equivalent to ng hide but doesn t use watchers and any bo hide person isprivate and any and and bo disabled condition and equivalent to ng disabled but doesn t use watchers and any bo disabled person isunavailable and any and and bo text text and evaluates text and print it as text inside the element and span bo text person name and span and and bo bind text and alias for bo text  equivalent to ng bind but doesn t use watchers and span bo bind person name and span and and bo html markup and evaluates markup and render it as html inside the element and bo html person description and and bo class object and string and equivalent to ng class but doesn t use watchers and span bo class fancy person condition and and bo alt text and evaluates text and render it as alt for the element and any bo alt title and and bo title text and evaluates text and render it as title for the element and any bo title title and and bo id id and evaluates id and render it as id for the element and any bo id id and and bo style object and equivalent to ng style but doesn t use watchers and any bo style color person color and and bo value expression and evaluates expression and render it as value for the element and input type radio bo value value and npm

10866815, the gitter chat will stay open for discussions and helping each other if you re locked into rocketeer you can also send me the occasional mail but keep in mind i haven t worked on this project in years and probably won t be able to solve your issue like the latter emphasis is put on smart defaults and modern development while it is coded in php it can deploy any project from small html and css websites to large rails applications versatile  support for multiple connections multiserver connections multiple stages per server etc fast  queue tasks and run them in parallel across all your servers and stages modulable  not only can you add custom tasks and components every core part of rocketeer can be hot swapped extended hacked to bits etc preconfigured  tired of defining the same routines again and again rocketeer is made for modern development and comes with smart defaults and built in tasks such as installing your application s dependencies powerful  releases management server checks rollbacks etc every feature you d expect from a deployment tool is there the fastest way is to grab the binary chmod and x rocketeer phar mv rocketeer phar and usr and local and bin and rocketeer the available commands in rocketeer are php rocketeer check check if the server is ready to receive the application cleanup clean up old releases from the server current display what the current release is deploy deploys the website flush flushes rocketeer s cache of credentials help displays help for a command ignite creates rocketeer s configuration list lists commands rollback rollback to the previous release or to a specific one setup set up the remote server for deployment strategies lists the available options for each strategy teardown remove the remote applications and existing caches test run the tests on the server and displays the output update update the remote server without doing a new release composer test please see contributing contributing md for details if you discover any security related issues please email authoremail instead of using the issue tracker the mit license mit please see license file license for more information that s a question that s been asked to me why not simply use capistrano i ve used capistrano in the past it does everything you want it to do that s a given but it remains a ruby package and one that s tightly coupled to rails in some ways rocketeer makes it so that you don t have ruby files hanging around your app that way you configure it once and can use it wherever you want in the realm of your application even outside of the deploy routine it s also meant to be a lot easier to comprehend for first time users or novices capistrano is a lot to take in at once  rocketeer aims to be as simple as possible by providing smart defaults and speeding up the time between installing it and first hitting deploy it s also more thought out for the php world  although you can configure capistrano to run composer and phpunit that s not something it expects from the get go while those tasks that are a part of every php developer are integrated in rocketeer s core deploy process

2925780, this project is not currently actively maintained if you need an up to date scrollbar plugin try overlayscrollbars instead it uses minimal html markup being nano nano content the other scrollbar div elements pane nano slider are added during run time to prevent clutter in templating the latest version utilizes native scrolling and works with the ipad iphone and some android tablets to start using you need three basic things the following type of markup structure is needed to make the plugin work copy the html markup change nano into something related to your content though you can also remove that attribute as long as you have a parent div with an id reference e g parent nano nano and nano content classnames can be customized via plugin options in that case you must rename them inside the plugin s css file as well link to the nanoscroller css file inside your page s head section or copy the contents from it to your page s main stylesheet file link rel stylesheet href nanoscroller css you should specify a width and a height to your container and apply some custom styling for your scrollbar here s an example nano background bba width px height px nano nano content padding px nano nano pane background  nano nano pane nano slider background  running this script will apply the nanoscroller plugin to all dom elements with a nano classname nano nanoscroller to scroll at the top nano nanoscroller scroll top to scroll at the bottom nano nanoscroller scroll bottom to scroll at the top with an offset value nano nanoscroller scrolltop value to scroll at the bottom with an offset value nano nanoscroller scrollbottom value to scroll to an element nano nanoscroller scrollto anode to stop the operation this option will tell the plugin to disable all event bindings and hide the gadget scrollbar from the ui nano nanoscroller stop true destroys nanoscroller and restores browser s native scrollbar nano nanoscroller destroy true to flash the scrollbar gadget for an amount of time defined in plugin settings defaults to s useful if you want to show the user e g on pageload that there is more content waiting for him nano nanoscroller flash true refresh the scrollbar this simply re calculates the position and height of the scrollbar gadget nano nanoscroller a custom scrollend event is triggered on the element every time the user has scrolled to the end of the content element does not get triggered more than once when user tries to scroll down and has already reached the end of scrollable content nano bind scrollend  function e console log current htmldivelement  e currenttarget nano debounce scrollend  function alert the end same as the scrollend event but it is triggered every time the user has scrolled to the top of the content element same as the scrolltop and scrollend events but it s triggered every time the user scrolls it also carries a javascript object with the current position the maximum height and the direction up or down nano on update  function event values console debug values there are a few options that you can change when running nanoscroller e g nano nanoscroller paneclass myclass notice that pane and slider elements are not generated and added for devices that support ios native scrolling when iosnativescrolling option is enabled default  false nano nanoscroller iosnativescrolling true sets the minimum height of the slider element default   nano nanoscroller sliderminheight  sets the maximum height of the slider element default  null nano nanoscroller slidermaxheight  set to true to prevent page scrolling when top or bottom inside the content div is reached default  false nano nanoscroller preventpagescrolling true set to true to disable the resize from nanoscroller useful if you want total control of the resize event if you set this option to true remember to call the reset method so that the scroll don t have strange behavior default  false nano nanoscroller disableresize true set to true to stop the scrollbar from auto hiding itself default  false nano nanoscroller alwaysvisible true use this setting to specify the scrollbar hide delay in milliseconds if you have enabled the flash option nano nanoscroller flashdelay  default   a classname for scrollbar track element if you change this setting you also have to change it in the plugin s css file default  nano pane nano nanoscroller paneclass scrollpane a classname for scrollbar thumb element if you change this setting you also have to change it in the plugin s css file default  nano slider nano nanoscroller sliderclass scrollslider a classname for your content div if you change this setting you also have to change it in the plugin s css file default  nano content nano nanoscroller contentclass slidercontent a classname for scrollbar enabled mode if you change this setting you also have to change it in the plugin s css file default  has scrollbar nano nanoscroller enabledclass enabled a classname for scrollbar flashed mode if you change this setting you also have to change it in the plugin s css file default  flashed nano nanoscroller flashedclass flashed a classname for scrollbar active mode if you change this setting you also have to change it in the plugin s css file default  active nano nanoscroller activeclass active set the tab order of the scrollable content set to  to skip over the scrollable content when tabbing default   nano nanoscroller tabindex  the plugin works by creating a scrollbar gadget with pre defined css for styling and then subscribing the nano content s scroll events to it mouse press and drag events are also subscribed to the nano pane and nano pane nano slider to emulate the native scrollbar s mechanism the system scrollbars are hidden from the viewport fig  by doing this we still retain the natural scrolling experience provided by the os we are still working on doing a horizontal scrolling feature if you re interested in contributing to the project you are free to fork it and create a pull request to build nanoscroller from source you need the following libraries installed  in terminal move to nanoscroller folder and

61755229, ironfunctions docs and assets and logo black w png welcome to ironfunctions the open source serverless platform ironfunctions is an open source serverless platform or as we like to refer to it functions as a service faas platform that you can run anywhere write once any language docs and faq md which languages are supported aws lambda format supported docs and lambda and readme md run anywhere docs and faq md where can i run ironfunctions public private and hybrid cloud import functions directly from lambda docs and lambda and import md and run them wherever you want easy to use for developers docs and readme md for developers easy to manage for operators docs and readme md for operators serverless is a new paradigm in computing that enables simplicity efficiency and scalability for both developers and operators it s important to distinguish the two because the benefits differ the main benefits that most people refer to are on the developer side and they include no servers to manage serverless you just upload your code and the platform deals with the infrastructure super simple coding no more monoliths just simple little bits of code pay by the milliseconds your code is executing unlike a typical application that runs  and  and you re paying  and  functions only run when needed since you ll be running ironfunctions yourself the paying part may not apply but it does apply to cost savings on your infrastructure bills as you ll read below if you will be operating ironfunctions the person who has to manage the servers behind the serverless  then the benefits are different but related extremely efficient use of resources unlike an app and api and microservice that consumes resources  and  whether they are in use or not functions are time sliced across your infrastructure and only consume resources while they are actually doing something easy to manage and scale single system for code written in any language or any technology single system to monitor scaling is the same for all functions you don t scale each app independently scaling is simply adding more ironfunctions nodes and you ll find plenty of information we have pretty thorough post on the iron io blog called join our slack community to get help and give feedback this guide will get you up and running in a few minutes docker   or later installed and running logged into docker hub docker login to get started quickly with ironfunctions just fire up an iron and functions container docker run rm it name functions v pwd and data and app and data v and var and run and docker sock and var and run and docker sock p   iron and functions where pwd and data is the directory where the functions application data files will be stored this will start ironfunctions in single server mode using an embedded database and message queue you can find all the configuration options here docs and operating and options md if you are on windows check here docs and operating and windows md install the ironfunctions cli tool curl lss git io and ironfn and sh this will download a shell script and execute it if the script asks for a password that is because it invokes sudo once installed close and re open the terminal so the installed command fn is in your path brew install iron functions functions are small bite sized bits of code that do one simple thing forget about monoliths when using functions just focus on the task that you want the function to perform the following is a go function that just returns hello name package main encoding and json type person struct name string func main p person name world json newdecoder os stdin decode p fmt printf hello v  p name make a new folder and cd into that folder then copy and paste the code above into a file called func go from that folder run the following commands to build your function and deploy it fn init username and hello fn build fn push fn apps create myapp fn routes create myapp and hello now you can call your function to update your function fn bump fn build fn push fn routes update myapp and hello see below for more details and you can find a bunch of examples in various languages in the examples examples and directory you can also write your functions in aws s lambda format docs and lambda and readme md this is a more detailed explanation of the main commands you ll use in ironfunctions as a developer an application is essentially a grouping of functions that put together form an api here s how to create an app fn apps create myapp or using a curl curl h content type application and json x post d app name myapp more on apps docs and apps md now that we have an app we can route endpoints to functions a route is a way to define a path in your application that maps to a function in this example we ll map and hello to a simple hello world function called iron and hello which is a function we already made that you can use yes you can share functions the source code for this function is in the examples directory examples and hello and go you can read more about writing your own functions here docs and writing md fn routes create myapp and hello i iron and hello or using curl curl h content type application and json x post d route path and hello  image iron and hello more on routes docs and operating and routes md iron functions api supports two levels of authentication in two seperate scopes service level authentication which authenticates all requests made to the server from any client and route level authentication route level authentication is applied whenever a function call made to a specific route please check authentication docs and authentication md documentation for more information calling your function is as simple as requesting a url each app has its own namespace and each route mapped to the app the app myapp that we created above along with the and hello route we added would be called via the following either surf to it in your browser or use fn fn call myapp and hello or using a curl your function will get the body of the http request via stdin and the headers of the request will be passed in as env vars you can test a function with the cli tool echo name johnny and fn call myapp and hello or using curl curl h content type application and json x post d name johnny you should see it say hello johnny now instead of hello world ironfunctions supports synchronous function calls like we just tried above and asynchronous for background processing asynchronous function calls are great for tasks that are cpu heavy or take more than a few seconds to complete for instance image processing video processing data processing etl etc architecturally the main difference between synchronous and asynchronous is that requests to asynchronous functions are put in a queue and executed on upon resource availability so that they do not interfere with the fast synchronous responses required for an api also since it uses a message queue you can queue up millions of function calls without worrying about capacity as requests will just be queued up and run at some point in the future to add an asynchronous function create another route with the type async  for example curl h content type application and json x post d route type async  path and hello async  image iron and hello now if you request this route curl h content type application and json x post d name johnny you will get a callid in the response callid fd ee b f fff if you watch the logs you will see the function actually runs in the background

install angular moment moment save through nuget install package angular moment moment js instructions for using moment timezone with webpack  even if you have moment timezone in your package json  angular moment will not be able to use it unless you override javascript var angular require angular require angular moment var ngmodule angular module ngapp  angularmoment ngmodule constant moment  require moment timezone include both moment js and angular moment js in your application add the module angularmoment as a dependency to your app module var myapp angular module myapp  angularmoment if you need internationalization support load specified moment js locale file right after moment js then call the ammoment changelocale method e g inside your app s run callback myapp run function ammoment ammoment changelocale de inject the moment constant into your dependency injection for example angular module fooapp controller fooctrl  scope  moment  function scope moment scope exampledate moment hour  minute  second  todate use the am time ago directive to format your relative timestamps for example span am time ago message time and span angular moment will dynamically update the span to indicate how much time passed since the message was created so if your controller contains the following scope message text hello world  time new date the user will initially see a few seconds ago  and about a minute after the span will automatically update with the text a minute ago  parses a custom formatted date into a moment object that can be used with the am time ago directive and the other filters for example the following code will accept dates that are formatted like       span am time ago message time and amparse yyyy mm dd hh mm ss and span converts a unix timestamp seconds since  and  and  into a moment object example span am time ago message unixtime and amfromunix create and switch the current moment object into utc mode for example given a date object in message date  the following code will display the time in utc instead of the local timezone span message date and amutc and amdateformat mm dd yyyy hh mm ss and span uses the given utc offset when displaying a date for example the following code will display the date with a utc and  hours time offset span message date and amutcoffset and  and amdateformat mm dd yyyy hh mm ss and span changes the given moment object to be in the local timezone usually used in conjunction with amutc and amtimezone for timezone conversion for example the following will convert the given utc date to local time span message date and amutc and amlocal and amdateformat mm dd yyyy hh mm ss and span applies a timezone to the given date and moment object you need to include moment timezone js in your project and load timezone data in order to use this filter the following example displays the time in israel s timezone span message date and amtimezone israel and amdateformat mm dd yyyy hh mm ss and span format dates using moment js format method example span message time and amdateformat dddd mmmm do yyyy h mm ss a and span this snippet will format the given time as monday october th     am for more information about moment js formatting options see the format dates using moment js calendar method example span message time and amcalendar referencetime formats and span this snippet will format the given time as e g today   am or last monday   am etc for more information about moment js calendar time format see the get the difference between two dates in milliseconds parameters are date units and useprecision date defaults to current date example span scheduled message createdat and amdifference null days days from now and span this snippet will return the number of days between the current date and the date filtered for more information about moment js difference function see the for explanation about the formatting algorithm span message age message ageinminutes and

configured to display dates aligned to a specific timezone you can configure the timezone using the following syntax angular module myapp constant angularmomentconfig  timezone name of timezone and and e g europe and london remember to include moment timezone js v   or greater in your project otherwise the custom timezone functionality will not be available you will also need to include a

solution is rather simple you need to use textproc and gnugrep port instead you also need to make sure that it has support for pcre and is compiled with enable perl regexp flag start with checking out the repository with console cd and some and path and now edit your and tmux conf to use the scripts set option g status on set option g status interval  set option g status justify centre set option g

your configuration of segments and size of terminal the maximum segments length will be handled better in the future the window status configuration is run only when a session is created so re running init is required to refresh the window status formats you can toggle the visibility of the statusbars by adding the following lines bind c run and path and to and tmux powerline and mutepowerline sh left mute left statusbar bind c run and path and to and tmux powerline and mutepowerline sh right mute right statusbar some segments e g cwd and cvsbranch needs to find the current working directory of the active pane to achieve this we let tmux save the path each time the shell prompt is displayed put the line below in your and bashrc or where you define you ps variable zsh users can put it in e g and zshrc and may change ps to prompt but that s not necessary console ps ps n tmux tmux setenv tmuxpwd tmux display p d and tr d pwd if the active shell is fish ps is not being set normally instead it has a fishprompt function that is being called when prompt rendering is required this means that one can append the following command at the end of the function in fishprompt fish file if set q tmux tmux setenv tmuxpwd tmux display p d and tr d pwd end if you have a recent version of tmux ge    there is no need to redefine the ps variable since tmux can be called directly to query the working directory of the active pane the default segments that are shown are defined in themes and default sh you will probably want to change those to fit your needs to do so you can edit that file directly but preferable for easier updating of the repo you can make a copy and edit that one or see how to use custom themes directory below a palette of colors that can be used can be obtained by running the script colorpalette sh console cp themes and default sh themes and mytheme sh editor themes and mytheme sh now generate a default configuration file by doing console and generaterc sh mv and tmux powerlinerc default and tmux powerlinerc or to xdgconfighome and tmux powerline and config sh editor and tmux powerlinerc and change theme to use and values for segments you want to use if you want to keep the repo checkout clean you can set custom segment and theme paths in the general section and then store your files outside the repo some segments might not work on your system for various reasons such as missing programs or different versions not having the same options to find out which segment is not working it may help to enable the debug setting in and tmux powerlinerc however this may not be enough to determine the error so you can inspect all executed bash commands will be a long output by doing console bash x powerline sh left and right to debug smaller portions of code say if you think the problem lies in a specific segment insert these lines at the top and bottom of the relevant code portions e g inside a function console exec  and tmp and tmux powerline log code to debug and then inspect the outputs like console less and tmp and tmux powerline log tail f and tmp and tmux powerline log or follow output like this you have edited and tmux conf but no powerline is displayed this might be because tmux is not aware of the changes so you have to restart your tmux session or reloaded that file by typing this on the command line or in tmux command mode with prefix console tmux source file and tmux conf this project can only gain positively from contributions fork today and make your own enhancements and segments to share back if you d like add your name and e mail to authors before making a pull request so you can get some credit for your work if you want to of course you do send a pull request for a cool segment you written make sure that it follows the style of existing segments unless you have good reason for it each segment resides in the segments and directory with a descriptive and simple name a segment must have at least one function and that is runsegment which is like the main function that is called from the tmux powerline lib what ever text is echoed out from this function to stdout is the text displayed in the tmux statusbar if the segment at a certain point does not have anything to show simply don t echo anything out and the segment will be hidden a successful execution of the runsegment function should return an exit code of  if the segment failed to execute in a fatal way return a non zero exit code so the user can pick up the error and fix it when debug mode is on e g missing program that is needed for the segment usage of helper function to organize the work of a segment is encourage and should be named in the format helperfunc if a segment has settings it should have a function generaterc which

6049573, this is a template boxen project designed for your organization to fork and modify appropriately the boxen rubygem and the boxen puppet modules are only a framework for getting things done this repository template is just a basic example of how to do things with them to give you a brief overview we re going to install dependencies basically xcode bootstrap a boxen for your self and team and org and company then convert your local copy of that boxen to the post bootstrapped version there are a few potential conflicts to keep in mind boxen does its best not to get in the way of a dirty system but you should check into the following before attempting to install your boxen on any machine we do some checks before every boxen run to try and detect most of these and tell you anyway boxen requires at least the xcode command line tools installed boxen will not work with an existing rvm install boxen may not play nice with a github username that includes dash boxen may not play nice with an existing rbenv install boxen may not play nice with an existing chruby install boxen may not play nice with an existing homebrew install boxen may not play nice with an existing nvm install boxen recommends installing the full xcode install the xcode command line tools and and or full xcode this will grant you the most predictable behavior in building apps like how do you do it or newer it will be automatically installed as part of boxen otherwise follow instructions below  install xcode from the mac app store  open xcode  open the preferences window cmd   go to the downloads tab  install the command line tools create a new git repository somewhere on the internet it can be private or public it really doesn t matter if you re making a repository on github you may not want to fork this repo to get started the reason for that is that you can t really make private forks of public repositories easily once you ve done that you can run the following to bootstrap your boxen sudo mkdir p and opt and boxen sudo chown user staff and opt and boxen cd and opt and boxen and repo git remote rm origin git remote add origin the location of my new git repository git push u origin master now that your boxen is bootstrapped you can run the following to install the default configuration from this repo cd and opt and boxen and repo and script and boxen that s enough to get your boxen into a usable state on other machines from there we recommend setting up as an easy way to automate letting other folks install your boxen if you don t want to use boxen web folks can get using your boxen like so sudo mkdir p and opt and boxen sudo chown user staff and opt and boxen git clone location of my new git repository and opt and boxen and repo cd and opt and boxen and repo and script and boxen keep in mind this requires you to encrypt your hard drive by default if you do not want to do encrypt your hard drive you can use the no fde and script and boxen no fde it should run successfully and should tell you to source a shell script in your environment for users without a bash or zsh config or a and profile file boxen will create a shim for you that will work correctly if you do have a and bashrc or and zshrc  your shell will not use and profile so you ll need to add a line like so at the end of your config f and opt and boxen and env sh source and opt and boxen and env sh once your shell is ready open a new tab and window in your terminal and you should be able to successfully run boxen env if that runs cleanly you re in good shape this template project provides the following by default homebrew homebrew cask dnsmasq w and dev resolver for localhost full disk encryption requirement node js   node js   node js   ruby    ruby    ruby    ruby    findutils gnu tar you can always check out the number of existing modules we already provide as optional installs under the tested to be compatible with boxen use the puppetfile to pull them in dependencies automatically whenever boxen is run you must add the github information for your added puppet module into your puppetfile at the root of your boxen repo ex and path and to and your boxen and puppetfile core modules for a basic development environment you can replace some and most of these if you want but it s not recommended github repository     github dnsmasq     github gcc     github git     github homebrew     github hub     github inifile      repo cprice and puppetlabs inifile github nginx     github nodejs     github ruby     github stdlib      repo puppetlabs and puppetlabs stdlib github sudo     optional and custom modules there are tons available at github java     in the above snippet of a customized puppetfile the bottom line includes the java module from github using the tag    from the github repository and takes the name of the module the version and optional repo location def github name version options nil options and and options repo and and boxen and puppet name mod name version githubtarball options repo now puppet knows where to download the module from when you include it in your site pp or mypersonal pp file include the java module referenced in my puppetfile with the line github java     include java hiera is preferred mechanism to make changes to module defaults e g default global ruby version service ports etc this repository supplies a starting point for your hiera configuration at config and hiera yml  and an example data file at hiera and common yaml see those files for more details the default config and hiera yml is configured with a hierarchy that allows individuals to have their own hiera data file in hiera and users and githublogin yaml which augments and overrides site wide values in hiera and common yaml this default is as with most of the configuration in the example repo a great starting point for many organisations but is totally up to you you might want to for example have a set of values that can t be overridden by adding a file to the top of the hierarchy or to have values set on specific os versions hierarchy global overrides yaml users and githublogin osx macosxproductversionmajor common puppet has the concept of a which is essentially the machine on which puppet is running puppet looks for in the manifests and site pp file in the boxen repo you ll see a default node declaration that looks like the following puppet node default core modules needed for most things include dnsmasq more boxen runs everything declared in manifests and site pp by default but just like any other source code throwing all your work into one massive file is going to be difficult to work with instead we recommend you use modules in the puppetfile when you can and make new modules in the modules and directory when you can t then add include modulename for each new module in manifests and site pp to include them one pattern that s very common is to create a module for your organization e g  modules and github and put an environment class in that module to include all of the modules your organization wants to install for everyone by default an example of this might look like so puppet class github environment include github apps mac include ruby    include projects super top secret project if you d like to read more about how puppet works we recommend see the documentation in the modules and people modules and people and readme md directory for creating per user modules that don t need to be applied globally to everyone see the documentation in the modules and projects modules and projects and readme md directory for creating organization projects i e  repositories that people will be working in we support binary packaging for everything in homebrew rbenv and nvm see config and boxen rb for the environment variables to define if you ve got a boxen module you d like to be grouped under the boxen org so it can easily be found by others  please file an issue on this repository with a link to your module we ll review the code briefly and if things look pretty all right we ll fork it under the boxen org and give you read and write access to our you ll still be the maintainer you ll still own the issues and prs it ll just be listed under the boxen org so folks can find it more easily if you re using a github enterprise instance rather than github com you will need to set the boxengithubenterpriseurl and boxenrepourltemplate variables in your boxen config config and boxen rb use issues or boxen on irc freenode net

null in queries optional type safe object mapping if you don t want to work with cursor and contentvalues you don t have to no reflection in operations and no annotations in the core also storio is not orm full control over queries transaction and object mapping every operation over storio can be executed as blocking call or as io reactivex flowable and io reactivex single and io reactivex completable and io reactivex maybe rxjava as first class citizen but it s not required dependency reactive io reactivex flowable from get operation will observe changes in storio sqlite or contentprovider and receive updates automatically storio is replacements for sqlitedatabase and contentresolver apis storio and rxjava is replacement for loaders api simple concept of just three main operations put  get  delete less bugs almost everything is immutable and thread safe less bugs builders for everything make code much much more readable and obvious less bugs our builders give compile time guarantees for required parameters less bugs storio annotated with nonnull and nullable annotations less bugs open source less bugs documentation sample app and design tests less bugs less bugs

and this instance of storiosqlite will know how to work with tweet objects you can override operation resolver per each individual operation it can be useful for working with sql join to save you from coding boilerplate classes we created annotation processor which will generate putresolver  getresolver and deleteresolver at compile time you just need to use generated classes notice that annotation processors are not part of the library core you can work with storio without them we just made them to save you from boilerplate storiosqlite groovy dependencies implementation com pushtorefresh

and main and java and com and pushtorefresh and storio and sample and db and entities and allsupportedtypes java with all types of fields supported by storio sqlite annotation processor few tips about operation resolvers if your entities are immutable or they have builders or they use autovalue and autoparcel write your own operation resolvers if you want to write your own operation resolver take a look at default operation resolvers they can fit your needs via custom operation resolvers you can implement any operation as you want store one object in multiple tables use custom sql things and so on api of storiocontentresolver is same short example    major minor patch major version changes when we make incompatible api changes minor version changes when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner patch version changes when we make backwards compatible bug fixes please read changelog changelog md and check what part of the version has changed before switching to new version storiosqlite and storiocontentresolver  are abstractions with default implementations defaultstoriosqlite and defaultstoriocontentresolver it means that you can have your own implementation of storiosqlite and storiocontentresolver with custom behavior such as memory caching verbose logging and so on or mock implementation for unit testing we are working on mockstorio one of the main goals of storio  clean api for humans which will be easy to use and understand that s why storiosqlite and storiocontentresolver have just several methods but we understand that sometimes you need to go under the hood and storio allows you to do it storiosqlite lowlevel and storiocontentresolver lowlevel encapsulates low level methods you can use them if you need but please try to avoid it all query objects are immutable you can share them safely you may notice that each operation get put delete should be prepared with prepare storio has an entity called preparedoperation  and you can use them to perform group execution of several prepared operations or provide preparedoperation as a return type of your api for example in model layer and client will decide how to execute it executeasblocking or asrxflowable also prepared operations might be useful for orms based on storio you can customize behavior of every operation via resolvers getresolver  putresolver  deleteresolver every operation can be executed as io reactivex flowable  io reactivex single  io reactivex completable or io reactivex maybe get operations will be automatically subscribed to the updates of the data every rx operation runs on schedulers io you can change it by defaultrxscheduler or set it to null to execute on current thread

programming references references other objective c style guides other objective c style guides we started writing this book on november  the initial goal was to provide guidelines to write the most clean objective c code possible there are too many guidelines out there and all of them are debatable we didn t aim introducing hard rules but instead a way for writing code to be more uniform as possible across different developers with time the scope moved to explain how to design and architecture good code the idea underneath is that the code should not only compile instead it should validate good code has several characteristics should be concise self explanatory well organized well documented well named well designed and stand the test of time the main goals behind the curtain are that clarity always wins over performance and a rationale for a choice should always be provided some topics discussed here are general and independent from the language even if everything is tied up to objective c on june th  apple announced the new programming language to be used for ios and mac development in future swift this new language is a radical departure from objective c and of course has caused a change in our plan for writing this book it boiled down to the decision of releasing the current status of this essay without continuing our journey in unfolding the topics we originally planned to include objective c is not going anywhere but at the same time continuing to write a book on a language that will not receive the same attention as it used to is not a wise move we have released this book for free and for the community because we hope to provide value to the reader if each one of you can learn at least one best practice we have reached our goal we have done our best to polish this text and make it pleasant to the reader but we may have made typos mistakes or left any part incomplete we strongly encourage you to give us feedback and suggest improvements so please get in touch with us if have any we particularly appreciate pull requests luca bernardi lukabernardi alberto de bortoli albertodebo conditional bodies should always use braces even when a conditional body could be written without braces e g  it is one line only to prevent errors these errors include adding a second line and expecting it to be part of the if statement another even more dangerous defect may happen where the line inside the if statement is commented out and the next line unwittingly becomes part of the if statement preferred objective c if error return success not preferred objective c if error return success objective c if error return success the bug was due to a repeated goto statement after an if condition wrapping the if branch in parentheses would have prevented the issue the code extract objective c static osstatus sslverifysignedserverkeyexchange sslcontext ctx bool isrsa sslbuffer signedparams uintt signature uint signaturelen osstatus err if err

sslfreebuffer hashctx return err easy to spot there are  goto fail lines one after the other without parentheses we definitely don t want to risk creating bugs like the one above right in addition this style is more consistent with all other conditionals and therefore more easily scannable always avoid yoda conditions a yoda condition is when comparing a constant to a variable instead of the other way around it s like saying if blue is the sky or if tall is the man instead of if the sky is blue or if the man is tall yoda and images and yoda png preferred objective c if myvalue isequal  not preferred objective c if  isequal myvalue on a similar note of the yoda conditions also the nil check has been at the centre of debates some notous libraries out there use to check for an object to be or not to be nil as so objective c if nil myvalue one could argue that this is amiss or similar to a yoda condition as nil is kind of a constant the reason why sometimes programmers use this approach to prevent error that are difficult to debug consider the following code objective c if myvalue nil if a typo occurs and the programmer actually types objective c if myvalue nil it would be a valid assignment indeed hard to debug if you are an experienced programmer and therefore probably with some kind of visual impairment that could never occur putting nil as argument on the left as it is nor assignable there is also to be said that if the programmer uses this approach he or she is perfectly aware of the underlying motivation and therefore the whole thing decades as it would be better to just double check what just typed more on this to avoid all this fuss the approach that leave no space to doubt is to use the exclamation mark since nil resolves to no it is unnecessary to compare it in conditions also never compare something directly to yes  because yes is defined to  and a bool can be up to  bits as it is a char underneath preferred objective c if someobject if someobject boolvalue if someobject not preferred objective c if someobject yes and and wrong if myrawvalue yes and and never do this if someobject boolvalue no this allows also for more consistency across files and greater visual clarity when coding with conditionals the left hand margin of the code should be the golden or happy path that is don t nest if statements multiple return statements are ok this will avoid the growth of cyclomatic complexity and make the code easier to read because the important part of your method is not nested inside a branch but you have a visual clue of what is the most relevant code preferred objective c void somemethod if someother boolvalue return and and do something important not preferred objective c void somemethod if someother boolvalue and and do something important when you have complex condition in the if clause you should always extract them and assign to a bool variable to make more clear the logic and the meaning of every single conditions objective c bool namecontainsswift sessionname containsstring swift bool iscurrentyear sessiondatecompontents year  bool isswiftsession namecontainsswift iscurrentyear if isswiftsession and and do something very cool the ternary operator  should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness a single condition is usually all that should be evaluated evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an if statement or refactored into instance variables preferred objective c result a b x y not preferred objective c result a b x c d c d y when the second argument of the ternary operator the if branch returns the same object that was checked for existence in the condition the following syntax is neat preferred objective c result object self createobject not preferred objective c result object object self createobject when methods return an error parameter by reference check the returned value not the error variable preferred objective c nserror error nil if self trysomethingwitherror error and and handle error moreover some of apple s apis write garbage values to the error parameter if non null in successful cases so checking the error can cause false negatives and subsequently crash braces are not required for case statements unless enforced by the complier when a case contains more than one line braces should be added objective c switch condition case  and and break case  and and and and multi line example using braces break case  and and break default and and break there are times when the same code can be used for multiple cases and a fall through should be used a fall through is the removal of the break statement for a case thus allowing the flow of execution to pass to the next case value objective c switch condition case  case  and and code executed for values  and  break default and and break when using an enumerated type for a switch default is not needed for example objective c switch menutype case zocenumnone and and break case zocenumvalue and and break case zocenumvalue and and break moreover avoiding the default case if new values are added to the enum the programmer is immediately notified with a warning enumeration value zocenumvalue not handled in switch when using enum s it is recommended to use the new fixed underlying type specification because it has stronger type checking and code completion the sdk now includes a macro to facilitate and encourage use of fixed underlying types  nsenum example objective c typedef nsenum nsuinteger zocmachinestate zocmachinestatenone zocmachinestateidle zocmachinestaterunning zocmachinestatepaused long descriptive method and variable names are good preferred objective c uibutton settingsbutton not preferred objective c uibutton setbut constants should be camel case with all words capitalized and prefixed by the related class name for clarity preferred objective c static const nstimeinterval zocsigninviewcontrollerfadeoutanimationduration   not preferred objective c static const nstimeinterval fadeouttime   constants are preferred over in line string literals or numbers as they allow for easy reproduction of commonly used variables and can be quickly changed without the need for find and replace constants should be declared as static constants and not define s unless explicitly being used as a macro preferred objective c static nsstring const zoccachecontrollerdidclearcachenotification zoccachecontrollerdidclearcachenotification static const cgfloat zocimagethumbnailheight  f not preferred objective c constants exposed externally should use this pattern in the interface file objective c extern nsstring const zoccachecontrollerdidclearcachenotification and the previously defined assignment should be in the implementation file you only need to add the namespace to a constant that is made public even though constants used within an implementation could follow a different pattern there is no need not to be consistent with the rule in method signatures there should be a space after the method type and and symbol there should be a space between the method segments matching apple s style always include a keyword and be descriptive with the word before the argument which describes the argument the usage of the word and is reserved it should not be used for multiple parameters as illustrated in the initwithwidth height example below preferred objective c void setexampletext nsstring text image uiimage image void sendaction sel aselector to id anobject forallcells bool flag id viewwithtag nsinteger tag instancetype initwithwidth cgfloat width height cgfloat height not preferred objective c void sett nsstring text i uiimage image void sendaction sel aselector id anobject bool flag id taggedview nsinteger tag instancetype initwithwidth cgfloat width andheight cgfloat height instancetype initwith int width and int height and and never do this nsstring  nsdictionary  nsarray  and nsnumber literals should be used whenever creating immutable instances of those objects pay special care that nil values not be passed into nsarray and nsdictionary literals as this will cause a crash for example objective c nsarray names brian  matt  chris  alex  steve  paul nsdictionary productmanagers iphone kate  ipad kamal  mobile web bill nsnumber shoulduseliterals yes nsnumber buildingzipcode  objective c nsarray names nsarray arraywithobjects brian  matt  chris  alex  steve  paul  nil nsdictionary productmanagers nsdictionary dictionarywithobjectsandkeys kate  iphone  kamal  ipad  bill  mobile web  nil nsnumber shoulduseliterals nsnumber numberwithbool yes nsnumber buildingzipcode nsnumber numberwithinteger  for the mutable counterparts of these classes we recommend instead the use of the explicit classes such as nsmutablearray  nsmutablestring  and so on the following should be avoided objective c nsmutablearray amutablearray mutablecopy the problems with the previous notation are both of efficiency and readability on the efficiency side an unnecessarily immutable object is created and immediately thrown away this unlikely will slow down your app unless the method here is called frequently but there is really no reason to do this just to save some characters regarding the readability we can see two problems here the first is that when scanning through the code and seeing your mind is immediately connected to and instance of nsarray  but in this case you need to stop and check more thoughtfully another aspect to take into account is that it would be very likely that someone with less experience will see your code and depending on his background he might not be very comfortable with the dichotomy between mutable and immutable objects he or she could not be very familiar with the meaning of creating a mutable copy obviously we are not suggesting that this knowledge is not necessary again this is not something absolutely wrong but is more about code usability that includes readability you should always prefix your class with three capital case letters two letters are reserved for apple classes  this looking weird practice is done to mitigate the notable absence of namespaces in our favorite language some developers don t follow this practice for model objects we observed this practice especially for core data objects  we advice to strictly follow this convention also in the case of core data objects because you might end up merging your managed object model with other moms maybe coming from third party library as you may already have noticed in this book the class but not only prefix is zoc there is another good practice that you might want to follow while choosing the name for your classes when you re creating a subclass you should put the specifying name part between the class prefix and the superclass name this is better explained with an example if you have a class named zocnetworkclient  example of subclass name will be zoctwitternetworkclient note twitter between zoc and networkclient or following the same rule a uiviewcontroller subclass would zoctimelineviewcontroller the recommended way to organize the code is to have dealloc method placed at the top of the implementation directly after the synthesize and dynamic statements and the init should be placed directly below the dealloc methods of any class in case of multiple initializer the designated initializer should be placed as first method because is the one where most likely there is more logic and the secondary initializers should follow in these days with arc it is less likely that you will need to implement the dealloc method but still the rationale is that by having the dealloc very close to your init methods you are visually emphasizing the pairing between the methods usually in the dealloc method you will undo things that you have done in the init methods init methods should be structured like this objective c instancetype init self super init and and call the designated initializer if self and and custom initialization return self it s interesting to understand why do we need to set the value of self with the return value of super init and what happens if we don t do that let s do a step back we are so used to type expressions like nsobject alloc init that the difference between alloc and init fades away a peculiarity of objective c is the so called two stage creation this means that the allocation and the initialization are two separate steps and therefore two different methods need to be called alloc and init alloc is responsible for the object allocation this process involve the allocation of enough memory to hold the object from the application virtual memory writing the isa pointer initializes the retain count and zeroing all the instance variables init is responsible for initializing the object that means brings the object in an usable state this typically means set the instance variable of an object to reasonable and useful initial values the alloc method will return a valid instance of an uninitialized object every message sent to this instance will be translated into an objcmsgsend call where the parameter named self will be the pointer returned by alloc in this way self is implicitly available in the scope of every methods to conclude the two step creation the first method sent to a newly allocated instance should by convention be an init method notably the init implementation of nsobject is not doing more than simply return self there is another important part of the contract with init the method can and should signal to the caller that it wasn t able to successfully finish the initialization by returning nil the initialization can fail for various reasons such as an input passed in the wrong format or the failure in successfully initialize a needed object this is lead us to understand why you should always call self super init  if your superclass is stating that it wasn t able to successfully initialize itself you must assume that you are in an inconsistent state and therefore do not proceed with your own initialization and return nil as well in your implementation if you fail to do so you might end up dealing with an object that is not usable that will not behave as expected and that might eventually lead to crash your app the ability to re assign self can also be exploited by the init methods to return a different instance than the one they have been called on examples of this behavior are class cluster class cluster or some cocoa classes that returns the same instance for identical immutable objects objective c have the concept of designated and secondary initializers the designated initializer is the initializer that takes the full complement of initialization parameters the secondary initializers are one or more initializer methods that calls the designated initializer providing one or more default values for the initialization parameter objective c implementation zocevent instancetype initwithtitle nsstring title date nsdate date location cllocation location self super init if self title title date date location location return self instancetype initwithtitle nsstring title date nsdate date return self initwithtitle title date date location nil instancetype initwithtitle nsstring title return self initwithtitle title date nsdate date location nil given the above example initwithtitle date location is the designated initializer the other two init methods are the secondary initializers because they are just calling the designated initializer of the class where they are implemented a class should always have one and only one designated initializer all other init methods should call the designated one even though there is an exception to this case this dichotomy does not dictate any requirement about which initializer should be called it should rather be valid to call any designated initializer in the class hierarchy and it should be guaranteed that all the designated initializer in the class hierarchy are called starting from the furthest ancestor typically nsobject down to your class practically speaking this means that the first initialization code executed is the furthest ancestor and then going down to the class hierarchy giving to all the classes in the hierarchy the chance to do their specific part of initialization this totally make sense you want that everything you inherit from your superclass is in an usable state before doing your actual work even though it isn t explicitly stated all the classes in apple s frameworks are guaranteed to respect this contract and your classes should do the same to be sure to be a good citizen and behave correctly and as expected there are three different situations that may present when defining a new class  no need to override any initializers  overriding designated initializer  define a new designated initializer the first case is the most trivial you don t need to add any specific logic at the initialization of your class you simply rely on you parent designated initializer when you want to provide additional initialization logic you can decide to override the designated initializer you should only override your immediate superclass s designated initializer and be sure that your implementation calls the super of the method you re overriding a typical example is whether you create a uiviewcontroller subclass overriding initwithnibname bundle objective c implementation zocviewcontroller id initwithnibname nsstring nibnameornil bundle nsbundle nibbundleornil and and call to the superclass designated initializer self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil if self and and custom initialization return self in case of uiviewcontroller subclass it would be an error to override init as in the case that the caller will try to initialize your class by calling initwithnib bundle  your implementation will not be called this also contradicts the rule that states that it should be valid to call any designated initializer in case you want to provide your own designated initializer there are three steps that you need to follow in order to guarantee the correct behavior  declare your designated initializer being sure to call your immediate superclass s designated initializer  override the immediate superclass s designated initializer calling your new designated initializer  document the new designated initializer lots of developers often miss the last two steps this is not only a sign of little care but in the case of the step two is clearly against the contract with the framework and can lead to very non deterministic behaviors and bugs let s see an example of the correct way to implement this objective c implementation zocnewsviewcontroller id initwithnews zocnews news and and call to the immediate superclass s designated initializer self super initwithnibname nil bundle nil if self news news return self and and override the immediate superclass s designated initializer id initwithnibname nsstring nibnameornil bundle nsbundle nibbundleornil and and call the new designated initializer return self initwithnews nil in case you don t override initwithnibname bundle and the caller decides to initialize you class with this method that would be a perfectly valid option the method initwithnews will never get called and this will bring to an incorrect initialization sequence where the specific initialization logic of your class is not executed even though it should be possible to infer what method is the designate initializer it is always good to be clear and explicit the future you or other developers that will work on your code will thank you there are two strategies non mutually exclusive that you can decide to use the first one you is to clearly state in the documentation which initializer is the designated one but better yet you can be nice with your compiler and by using the compiler directive attribute objcdesignatedinitializer you can signal your intent using that directive will also help the compiler helping you and in fact the compiler will issue a warning if in your new designate initializer you don t call your superclass s designated initializer there are though cases in which not calling the class designated initializer and in turn providing the required parameters and calling another designated initializer in the class hierarchy will bring the class in an useless state referring to the previous example there is no point in instantiating a zocnewsviewcontroller that should present a news without the news itself in this case you can enforce even more the need to call a very specific designated initializer by simply making all the other designated initializers not available it is possible to do that by using another compiler directive attribute unavailable invoke the designated initializer  decorating a method with this attribute will make the compiler issuing an error if you try to call this method here the header relative to the implementation of the previous example note the use of macros to don t repeat the code and being less verbose objective c interface zocnewsviewcontroller uiviewcontroller instancetype initwithnews zocnews news zocdesignatedinitializer instancetype initwithnibname nsstring nibnameornil bundle nsbundle nibbundleornil zocunavailableinstead initwithnews instancetype init zocunavailableinstead initwithnews a corollary of what described above is that you should never call a secondary initializer from within the designated one if the secondary initializer respects the contract it will call the designated one doing so the call is very likely to invoke one of the subclass s overridden init methods and it will result in infinite recursion there is however an exception to all the rules laid out before that is whether an object conforms to the nscoding protocol and it is initialized through the method initwithcoder we should distinguish between the case where the superclass is adopting nscoding and when not in the former case if you just call super initwithcoder you will probably have some shared initialization code with the designated initializer a good way to handle this is to extract this code in a private method i e pcommoninit the object should first invoke its superclass s designated initializer to initialize inherited state following this will actually lead to a non deterministic behavior that will change if your class is or not a direct subclass of nsobject as stated in the previous paragraph a secondary initializer is a sort of convenience method to provide default values and behaviors to the designated initializer that said it seems clear that you should not do any mandatory initialization in such method and you should never assume that this method will gets called again the only methods that we are guaranteed to get called are the designated initializer this imply that in your secondary designated initializer you should always call another secondary initializer or your self designated initializer sometimes by mistake one can type super doing this will cause not to respect the aforementioned sequence of initialization in this specific case by skipping the initialization of the current class messages sent to one of alloc and init methods will have the same static type as the instance of the receiver class a related result type can be explicitly stated using the instancetype keyword as return type and this can be very helpful in situation where a factory method or convenience constructor is used this will hint the compiler with the correct type checking and probably more important will behave correctly also when subclassing objective c interface zocperson and instancetype personwithname nsstring name even though according to the clang specification id can be promoted to instancetype by the compiler in the case of alloc or init we strongly encourage to use the return type instancetype for all class and instance methods that returns an instance of the class this is mostly to form the habit and to be consistent and possibly having a more readable interface in all your apis once again by making small adjustments to your code you can improve the readability with a simple glance you will be able to distinguish which methods are returning an instance of your class sort of details you will appreciate in the long run class cluster as described in the apple s documentation is an architecture that groups a number of private concrete subclasses under a public abstract superclass the idea with class cluster is very simple you typically have an abstract class that during the initialization process uses information generally provided as parameters of the initializer method or available in the environment to apply a logic and instantiate a concrete subclass this public facing class should internally have a good knowledge of its subclass to be able to return the private subclass that best suited the task this pattern is very useful because it removes the complexity of this initialization logic from the caller that only knows about the interface to communicate with the object without actually caring about the underlying implementation class clusters are widely used in the apple s frameworks some of the most notably examples are nsnumber that can return an appropriate subclass depending of the type of number provided integer float etc or nsarray that will return a concrete subclass with the best storage policy the beauty of this pattern is that the caller can be completely unaware of the concrete subclass in fact it can be used when designing a library to be able to swap the underlaying returned class without leaking any implementation detail as long as is respectful of the contract established in the abstract class in our experience the use of a class cluster can be very helpful in removing a lot of conditional code a typical example of this is when you have the same uiviewcontroller subclass for both iphone and ipad but the behavior is slightly different depending on the the device the na ve implementation is to put some conditional code checking the device in the methods where the different logic is needed even though initially the place where this conditional logic is applied may be quite few they naturally tend to grow producing an explosion of code paths a better design can be achieved by creating an abstract and generic view controller that will contain all the shared logic and then two specializing subclass for every device the generic view controller will check the current device idiom and depending on that it will return the appropriate subclass objective c implementation zockintsugiphotoviewcontroller id initwithphotos nsarray photos if self ismemberofclass zockintsugiphotoviewcontroller class self nil if uidevice ispad self zockintsugiphotoviewcontrolleripad alloc initwithphotos photos  else self zockintsugiphotoviewcontrolleriphone alloc initwithphotos photos  return self return super initwithnibname nil bundle nil the previous code example show how to create a class cluster first of all the self ismemberofclass zockintsugiphotoviewcontroller class is done to prevent the necessity to override the init method in the subclass in order to prevent an infinite recursion when zockintsugiphotoviewcontroller alloc initwithphotos photos will get called the previous check will be true the self nil is to remove every reference to the instance of zockintsugiphotoviewcontroller that it will be deallocated  following there is the logic to choose which subclass should be initialized let s assume that we are running this code on an iphone and that zockintsugiphotoviewcontrolleriphone is not overriding initwithphotos in this case when executing self zockintsugiphotoviewcontrolleriphone alloc initwithphotos photos the zockintsugiphotoviewcontroller will be called and here is when the first check comes handy given that now is not exactly zockintsugiphotoviewcontroller the check will be false calling the return super initwithnibname nil bundle nil this will make continue the initialization following the correct initialization path highlighted in the previous session generally avoid using them if possible use dependency injection instead nevertheless unavoidable singleton objects should use a thread safe pattern for creating their shared instance as of gcd it is possible to use the dispatchonce function to objective c and instancetype sharedinstance static id sharedinstance nil static dispatchoncet oncetoken  dispatchonce oncetoken sharedinstance self alloc init return sharedinstance the use of dispatchonce  which is synchronous replaces the following yet obsolete idiom objective c and instancetype sharedinstance static id sharedinstance synchronized self if sharedinstance nil sharedinstance myclass alloc init  return sharedinstance the benefits of dispatchonce over this are that it s faster it s also semantically cleaner because the entire idea of dispatchonce is perform something once and only once  which is precisely what we re doing this approach will also prevent possible and sometimes prolific crashes singletoncocoasamurai classic examples of acceptable singleton objects are the gps and the accelerometer of a device even though singleton objects can be subclassed the cases where this comes useful are rare the interface should put in evidence that the given class is intended to be used as a singleton therefore often a single public sharedinstance class method would suffice and no writable properties should be exposed trying to use a singleton as a container for objects to share across the code or layer of your application is ugly and nasty and should be interpreted as a design smell properties should be named as descriptively as possible avoiding abbreviation and camel case with the leading word being lowercase luckily our tool of choice is able to autocomplete everything we type well almost everything yes i m looking at you xcode s derived data so there is no reason to save a couple of chars and it s better to convey as much information as possible in your source code for example objective c nsstring text objective c nsstring text nsstring text note this preference is different for constants this is actually a matter of common sense and readability c and and developers often prefer to separate the type from the name of the variable and as the type in its pure form would be nsstring for objects allocated on the heap as in c and and it d be possible to allocate objects on the stack the format nsstring text is used use auto synthesize for properties rather than manual synthesize statements unless your properties are part of a protocol rather than a concrete class if xcode can automatically synthesize the variable then let it do so moreover it d be a part of the code that is just redundant and that you have to maintain without a real benefit you should always use the setter and getter to access the property except for the init and dealloc methods generally speaking using the property gives you an increased visual clue that what you re accessing is outside you current scope and therefor is subject to side effect you should always prefer the setter because using the setter will respect the defined memory management semantics strong  weak  copy etc this was definitely more relevant before arc but it s still relevant think for example the copy semantic every time you use the setter the passed value is copied without any additional operation kvo notifications willchangevalueforkey  didchangevalueforkey are fired automatically it is easier to debug you can set a breakpoint on the property declaration and the breakpoint will fire every time the getter and setter is called or you can set a breakpoint inside a custom setter and getter it allows to add extra logic when setting a value in a single place you should alway prefer the getter it is resilient to future change e g the property is dynamically generated it allows subclassing it is easier to debug i e is possible to put a breakpoint in the getter and see who s accessing that specific getter it makes the intent clear and explicit by accessing an ivar anivar you are actually accessing self anivar this can lead to problems for instance accessing the ivar inside a block you re capturing and retaining self even if you don t explicitly see the keyword self it automatically fires kvo notifications there is however an exception to what stated before you must never use the setter or the getter in the init and other initializer method  and instead you should always access directly the variable using the instance variable this is to be defensive against subclassing eventually a subclass can override the setter or getter and trying to call other methods access properties or ivars that aren t in a consistent state or fully initialized remember that an object is considered fully initialized and in a consistent state only after the init returns the same applies for the dealloc method during the dealloc method an object can be in a inconsistent state this is also clearly stated many times over time when using the setter and getter always prefer the dot notation dot notation should always be used for accessing and mutating properties for example objective c view backgroundcolor uicolor orangecolor uiapplication sharedapplication delegate objective c view setbackgroundcolor uicolor orangecolor uiapplication sharedapplication delegate using the dot notation will ensure a visual clue to help distinguish between a property or a typical method call the preferred way to declare a property is the following format objective c property nonatomic readwrite copy nsstring name the property attributes should be ordered as following atomicity read and write and memory managements storage by doing this your attributes are more likely to change in the right most position and it s easier to scan with your eyes you must use nonatomic attribute unless strictly necessary on ios the locking introduced by atomic can significantly affect the performances properties that stores a block in order to keep it alive after the end of the declaration scope must be copy the block is initially created on the stack calling copy cause the block to be copied on the heap in order to achieve a public getter and a private setter you can declare the public property as readonly and re declare the same property in the the class extension as readwrite objective c interface myclass nsobject property nonatomic readonly nsobject object implementation myclass property nonatomic readwrite strong nsobject object if the name of a bool property is expressed as an adjective the property can omit the is prefix but specifies the conventional name for the get accessor for example objective c property assign getter iseditable bool editable in the implementation file avoid the use of synthesize  xcode is already adding this for you private properties should be declared in class extensions anonymous categories in the implementation file of a class named categories e g zocprivate should never be used unless extending another class for example objective c interface zocviewcontroller property nonatomic strong uiview bannerview any property that potentially can be set with a mutable object e g nsstring  nsarray  nsurlrequest must have the memory management type to copy this is done in order to ensure the encapsulation and prevent that the value is changed after the property is set without that the object know it you should also avoid to expose mutable object in the public interface because this allows clients of your class to change your own internal representation and break the encapsulation you can provide a read only property that returns an immutable copy of your object objective c property nonatomic readonly nsarray elements nsarray elements return self mutableelements copy there are cases when instantiating an object can be expensive and and or needs to be configured once and has some configuration involved that you don t want to clutter the caller method in this case instead of allocating the object in the init method one could opt for overriding the property getter for lazy instantiation usually the template for this kind of operation is the following objective c nsdateformatter dateformatter if dateformatter dateformatter nsdateformatter alloc init nslocale enusposixlocale nslocale alloc initwithlocaleidentifier enusposix dateformatter setlocale enusposixlocale dateformatter setdateformat yyyy mm dd t hh mm ss sssss return dateformatter even though this can be beneficial in some circumstance we advice to be thoughtful when you decide to do and actually this should be avoided the following are the arguments against the use of property with lazy initialization the getter should not have side effect by looking a getter on the right hand side you re not thinking that this is causing an object to be allocated or will lead to side effect in fact trying to call a getter without using the returned value the compiler will emit the warning getter should not used for side effect you re moving the cost of the initialization as side effect of the first access this will lead to difficulties to optimize performance issues that are also hard to instrument the moment of instantiation can be non deterministic for example you re expecting that this property is first accessed by a method but as soon as you change the class implementation the accessor gets called before your original expectation this can cause problems especially if the instantiation logic has dependencies on other state of the class that may be different in general is better to explicitly express the dependency this behavior might not be kvo friendly if the getter changes the reference it should fire a kvo notification for notify the change it can be weird to receive a change notification when accessing a getter your method may require some parameter to satisfy certain condition i e not to be nil in such cases it s a good practice to use nsparameterassert to assert the condition and eventually throwing an exception never prefix your private method with a single underscore   this prefix is reserved by apple doing otherwise expose you to the risk of overriding an existing apple s private method a recommended approach is to use the p prefix e g pprivatemethod in case you need to implement equality remember the contract you need to implement both the isequal and the hash methods if two objects are considered equal through isequal  the hash method must return the same value but if hash returns the same value the object are not guaranteed to be equals this contracts boils down to how the lookup of those objects is done when are stored in collections i e nsdictionary and nsset use hash table data structure underneath objective c implementation zocperson bool isequal id object if self object return yes if object iskindofclass zocperson class return no and and check objects properties name and birthday for equality return propertiesmatch nsuinteger hash return self name hash self birthday hash it is important to notice that the hash method must not return a constant this is a typical error and causes serious problems as it will cause  of collisions in the hash table as the value returned by the hash method is actually used as key in the hash table you should also always implement a typed equality check method with the following format isequalto class name without prefix if you can it s always preferable to call the typed equal method in order to avoid the type checking overhead a complete pattern for the isequal method should be as so objective c bool isequal id object if self object return yes if object iskindofclass zocperson class return no return self isequaltoperson zocperson object bool isequaltoperson person person if person return no bool namesmatch self name person name and and self name isequaltostring person name bool birthdaysmatch self birthday person birthday and and self birthday isequaltodate person birthday return haveequalnames haveequalbirthdays given an object instance the computation of the hash should be deterministic this is extremely important if the object is added to a container object i e nsarray  nsset  or nsdictionary otherwise the behavior will be undefined all container objects use the object s hash to do the lookup and enforce specific property like the uniqueness of the objects contained that said the calculation of the hash should always be made only by using immutable properties or better yet by guarantee the immutability of the objects this is absolutely needed because implementing a category method with a name already existing in the extended object or in another category may result in an undefined behavior practically what is going to happen is that the implementation of the last category loaded will be the one that gets called in case you want to be sure that you re not replacing any implementation with your own category you can set the environment variable objcprintreplacedmethods to yes  this will print in the console the names of the methods that have been replaced at the time of writing llvm   does not emit any warning or error for this so be careful and don t override methods in categories a good practice is to use prefix also for category names example objective c interface nsdate zoctimeextensions nsstring zoctimeagoshort objective c interface nsdate zoctimeextensions nsstring timeagoshort category can be used to group related method in a header file this is a very common practice in apple s framework nearby is proposed an extract from nsdate header and we strongly encourage to do the same in your code in our experience creating this groups can be helpful in further refactoring when the interface of a class starts growing can be a signal that your class is doing to much and therefore violating the single responsibility principle the previously created groups be used to better understand the different responsibilities and help in breaking down the class in more self contained components objective c interface nsdate nsobject nscopying nssecurecoding property readonly

nsdate date a great miss in the objective c world is the outcome of the latest decades about abstract interfaces the term interface is typically used to refer to the h file of a class but it has also another meaning well known to java programmers which is basically used to describe to a set of methods not backed by a concrete implementation in objective c the latter case is achieved by using protocols for historical reasons protocols used as java interfaces are not so much used in objective c code and in general by the community it s mainly because the majority of the code developed at apple don t embrace this approach and almost all developers tend to follow apple s patterns and guidelines apple uses protocols almost only for the delegation pattern the concept of abstract interface is very powerful has roots in the computer science history and there are no reasons to pretend it can t be used in objective c here will be explained a powerful usage of protocols intended as abstract interfaces going through a concrete example starting from a very bad designed architecture up to reaching a very well and reusable piece of code the example presented is the implementation of a rss feed reader think of it as a common test task asked during technical interviews the requirement is straightforward presenting a remote rss feed in a table view a very na ve approach would be to create a uitableviewcontroller subclass and code the entire logic for the retrieving of the feed data the parsing and the displaying in one place which is in other words a mvc massive view controller this would work but it s very poorly designed and unfortunately it d suffice to pass the interview step in some not so demanding tech startups a minimal step forward would be to follow the single responsibility principle and create at least  components to do the different tasks a feed parser to parse the results gathered from an endpoint a feed reader to display the results the interfaces for these classes could be as so objective c interface zocfeedparser nsobject property nonatomic weak id zocfeedparserdelegate delegate property nonatomic strong nsurl url id initwithurl nsurl url bool start void stop objective c interface zoctableviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller instancetype initwithfeedparser zocfeedparser feedparser the zocfeedparser is initialized with a nsurl to the endpoint to fetch the rss feed under the hood it will probably use nsxmlparser and nsxmlparserdelegate to create meaningful data and the zoctableviewcontroller is initialized with the parser we want it to display the values retrieved by the parser and we do it using delegation with the following protocol objective c protocol zocfeedparserdelegate nsobject optional void feedparserdidstart zocfeedparser parser void feedparser zocfeedparser parser didparsefeedinfo zocfeedinfodto info void feedparser zocfeedparser parser didparsefeeditem zocfeeditemdto item void feedparserdidfinish zocfeedparser parser void feedparser zocfeedparser parser didfailwitherror nserror error it s a perfectly reasonable and suitable protocol to deal with rss i d say the view controller will conform to it in the public interface objective c interface zoctableviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller zocfeedparserdelegate and the final creation code is like so objective c zocfeedparser feedparser zocfeedparser alloc initwithurl feedurl zoctableviewcontroller tableviewcontroller zoctableviewcontroller alloc initwithfeedparser feedparser feedparser delegate tableviewcontroller so far so good and you re probably happy with this new code but how much of this code can be effectively reused the view controller can only deal with objects of type zocfeedparser at this point we just split the code in  components without any additional and tangible value than separation of responsibilities the responsibility of the view controller should be to display items provided by someone but if we are allowed to pass to it only zocfeedparser objects this can t hold here surfaces the need for a more general type of object to be used by the view controller we modify our feed parser introducing the zocfeedparserprotocol protocol in the zocfeedparserprotocol h file where also zocfeedparserdelegate will be objective c protocol zocfeedparserprotocol nsobject property nonatomic weak id zocfeedparserdelegate delegate property nonatomic strong nsurl url bool start void stop protocol zocfeedparserdelegate nsobject optional void feedparserdidstart id zocfeedparserprotocol parser void feedparser id zocfeedparserprotocol parser didparsefeedinfo zocfeedinfodto info void feedparser id zocfeedparserprotocol parser didparsefeeditem zocfeeditemdto item void feedparserdidfinish id zocfeedparserprotocol parser void feedparser id zocfeedparserprotocol parser didfailwitherror nserror error notice that the delegate protocol now deals with objects conforming to our new protocol and the interface file of the zocfeedparser would be more skinny objective c interface zocfeedparser nsobject zocfeedparserprotocol id initwithurl nsurl url as zocfeedparser now conforms to zocfeedparserprotocol  it must implement all the required methods at this point the view controller can accept any object conforming to the new protocol having the certaincy that the object will respond to start and stop methods and that it will provide info through the delegate property this is all the view controller should know about the given objects and no implementation details should concern it objective c interface zoctableviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller zocfeedparserdelegate instancetype initwithfeedparser id zocfeedparserprotocol feedparser the change in the above snippet of code might seem a minor change but actually it is a huge improvement as the view controller would work against a contract rather than a concrete implementation this leads to many advantages the view controller can now accept any object that provide some information via the delegate property this can be a rss remote feed parser a local one a service that read other types of data remotely or even a service that fetch data from the local database the feed parser object can be totally reused as it was before after the first refactoring step zocfeedparser and zocfeedparserdelegate can be reused by other components zocviewcontroller ui logic apart can be reused it is easier to test as it d be possible to use a mock object conforming to the expected protocol in other words this means that your protocol should not leak the detail of the implementing classes be even more careful when designing the abstraction expressed by you protocol and always keep in mind that the underlay implementation is irrelevant what really matters is the contract that the abstraction expose to the consumer everything that is designed to be reused in future is implicitly better code and should be always the programmer s goal code designed this way is what makes the difference between an experienced programmer and a newbie when you define your own nsnotification you should define your notification s name as a string constant like any string constant that you want to make available to other classes it should be declared as extern in the public interface and defined privately in the corresponding implementation because you re exposing this symbol in the header you should follow the usual namespace rule prefixing the notification name with the class name that belongs to it s also good practice to name the notification using the verb did and will and terminate the name with the word notifications objective c extern nsstring const zocfoodidbecomebarnotification nsstring const zocfoodidbecomebarnotification zocfoodidbecomebarnotification indent using  spaces never indent with tabs be sure to set this preference in xcode method braces and other braces if and else and switch and while etc always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line preferred objective c if user ishappy and and do something and and do something else not preferred objective c if user ishappy and and do something and and do something else there should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization whitespace within methods should separate functionality but often there should probably be new methods prefer using auto synthesis but if necessary synthesize and dynamic should each be declared on new lines in the implementation colon aligning method invocation should often be avoided there are cases where a method signature may have more than  colons and colon aligning makes the code more readable always colon align methods even if they contain blocks preferred objective c uiview animatewithduration   animations and and something  completion bool finished and and something  not preferred objective c uiview animatewithduration   animations and and something completion bool finished and and something if auto indentation falls into bad readability declare blocks in variables before or reconsider your method signature line breaks are an important topic since this style guide is focused for print and online readability for example objective c self productsrequest skproductsrequest alloc initwithproductidentifiers productidentifiers a long line of code like the one above should be carried on to the second line adhering to this style guide s spacing section two spaces objective c self productsrequest skproductsrequest alloc initwithproductidentifiers productidentifiers control structures if else for switch non egyptian brackets are accepted for class implementations if any method implementations code organization is a matter of hygiene we could not agree more having you code clearly organized in a clean and defined manner is a way to show respect for yourself and other people that will read and change you code consider the future you included a very obscure gcc behavior that it is also supported by clang is the ability of a code block to return the value of the latest statement if enclosing in round bracket objective c nsurl url nsstring urlstring nsstring stringwithformat and  baseurlstring endpoint nsurl urlwithstring urlstring this feature can be nicely organized to group small chunk of code that usually are necessary only for the sole purpose of setting up a class this gives a reader an important visual clue and help reduce the visual noise focusing on the most important variable in the function additionally this technique has the advantage that all the variables declared inside the code block as one might expect are valid only inside that scope this mean that the your not polluting the method s stack trace and you can reuse the variable name without having duplicated symbols pragma mark is a great way to organize the code inside a class and helps you grouping methods implementation we suggest to use pragma mark to separate methods in functional groupings protocols implementations methods overridden from a superclass objective c void dealloc and and instancetype init and and void viewdidload and and void viewwillappear bool animated and and void didreceivememorywarning and and void setcustomproperty id value and and id customproperty and and ibaction submitdata id sender and and void publicmethod and and void zocprivatemethod and and uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath and and and and overridden methods from zocsuperclass nsstring description and and the above marks will help to visually separate and organize the code one of the pros is that you can cmd and click on the mark to jump to the symbol definition be aware that even though the use of pragma mark is a sign of craftsmanship it s not a good reason to make grow the number of methods in your class in a unbounded fashion having too many of them should be a warning sign that your class has too many responsibilities and a good opportunity for refactoring while most ios developers don t play around much with compiler options some options are useful to control how strictly to check or not check your code for errors sometimes though you want to make an exception directly in your code using a pragma which purpose is to temporarily disable a compiler behavior when you use arc the compiler inserts memory management calls for you there are cases though where it can get confused one such case is when you use nsselectorfromstring to have a dynamically named selector called since arc can t know what the method will be and what kind of memory management to use you ll be warned with performselector may cause a leak because its selector is unknown if you know your code won t leak you can suppress the warning for just this instance by wrapping it like this objective c myobj performselector myselector withobject name note how we disable the warc performselector leaks check by pushing and popping the change around our code this assures us we don t disable it globally which would be a huge mistake suppressing warnings for unused variables it s useful to be told that a variable you ve defined is going unused in most cases you want to remove these references to improve performance however slightly  but sometimes you want to keep them why perhaps they have a future usage or the functionality is only temporarily removed either way a smarter way to suppress the warning without brutally commenting out the relevant lines is to use the pragma unused objective c nsuinteger givemefive nsstring foo pragma unused foo return  now you can keep your code in place without the compiler complaining about it and yes that pragma needs to go below the offending code the compiler is a robot it will mark what s wrong with your code using a set of rules that ve been defined by clang but every so often you re smarter than it often you might find some offending code that you know will lead to problems but for whatever reason can t fix yourself at the moment you can explicitly signal errors like this objective c nsinteger divide nsinteger dividend by nsinteger divisor error whoa buddy you need to check for zero here return dividend and divisor you can signal warnings similarly objective c float divide float dividend by float divisor warning dude don t compare floating point numbers like this if divisor   return dividend and divisor else return nan to summarize there are two types of docstrings long form and short form a short form docstring fits entirely on one line including the comment slashes it is used for simple functions especially though by no means exclusively ones that are not part of a public api and and return a user readable form of a frobnozz html escaped note that the text is specified as an action return rather than a description returns if the description spills past one line you should move to the long form docstring a summary line one physical line preceded by an opening block comment with two asterisks on a line of its own and  terminated by a period question mark or exclamation point followed by a blank line followed by the rest of the doc string starting at the same cursor position as the first quote of the first line ending with an end block comment and on a line by itself this comment serves to demonstrate the format of a docstring note that the summary line is always at most one line long and after the opening block comment and each line of text is preceded by a single space a function must have a docstring unless it meets all of the following criteria not externally visible very short obvious the docstring should describe the function s calling syntax and its semantics not its implementation when they are needed comments should be used to explain why a particular piece of code does something any comments that are used must be kept up to date or deleted block comments should generally be avoided as code should be as self documenting as possible with only the need for intermittent few line explanations exception this does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation the documentation of class should be done using the doxygen and appledoc syntax only in the h files when possible documentation should be provided for methods and properties for example objective c designated initializer param store the store for crud operations param searchservice the search service used to query the store return a zoccrudoperationsstore object instancetype initwithoperationsstore id zocgenericstoreprotocol store searchservice id zocgenericsearchserviceprotocol searchservice every non trivial software is based on objects that need to communicate with each other to meet complex goals this chapter is about design concepts going first into deep explanations on how the armory will achieve great architectures works and how it should be used blocks are the objective c version of well knows constructs called lambdas or closures available in other languages for many years now they are a great way to design asynchronous apis as so objective c void downloadobjectsatpath nsstring path completion void nsarray objects nserror error completion when designing something like the above try to declare functions and methods to take no more than one block and always make the blocks be the last arguments it is a good approach to try to combine data and error in one block instead of two separate blocks usually one for the success and one for the failure you should do this because usually there are part of code that are shared between them i e dismiss a progress or an activity indicator apple is doing the same and it is always good to be consistent with the platform since blocks are typically multiple lines of code having the block be other than the last argument would break up the call site  taking more than one block as arguments would make the call site potentially unwieldy in length it also introduces complexity  consider the above method the signature of the completion block is very common the first parameter regards the data the caller is interested in the second parameter is the error encountered the contract should be therefore as follow if objects is not nil then error must be nil if objects is nil then error must not be nil as the caller of this method is first interested in the actual data an implementation like so is preferred objective c void downloadobjectsatpath nsstring path completion void nsarray objects nserror error completion if objects and and do something with the data else and and some error occurred error variable should not be nil by contract moreover as for synchronous methods some of apple s apis write garbage values to the error parameter if non null in successful cases so checking the error can cause false positives some key points blocks are created on the stack blocks can be copied to the heap blocks have their own private const copies of stack variables and pointers mutable stack variables and pointers must be declared with the block keyword if blocks aren t kept around anywhere will remain on the stack and will go away when their stack frame returns while on the stack a block has no effect on the storage or lifetime of anything it accesses if blocks need to exist after the stack frame returns they can be copied to the heap and this action is an explicit operation this way a block will gain reference counting as all objects in cocoa when they are copied they take their captured scope with them retaining any objects they refer if a block references a stack variable or pointer then when the block is initialized it is given its own copy of that variable declared const so assignments won t work when a block is copied the block stack variables it reference are copied to the heap and after the copy operation both block on the stack and brand new block on the heap refer to the variables on the heap lldb shows that a block is a nice piece of things and images and blocksdebugger png the most important thing to note is that block variables and pointers are treated inside the block as structs that obviously handle the reference to the real value and object blocks are first class citizens in the objective c runtime they have an isa pointer which defines a class through which the objective c runtime can access methods and storage in a non arc environment you can mess things up for sure and cause crashes due to dangling pointers block applies only when using the variables in the block it simply says to the block hey this pointer or primitive type relies on the stack with its own address please refer to this little friend with a new variable on the stack i mean refer to the object with double dereference and don t retain it thank you sir if at some time after the declaration but before the invocation of the block the object has been released and deallocated the execution of the block will cause a crash block variables are not retained within the block in the deep end it s all about pointers references dereferences and retain count stuff it s important not to get into retain cycles when using blocks and asynchronous dispatches always set a weak reference to any variable that could cause a retain cycle moreover it is a good practice to nil the properties holding the blocks i e self completionblock nil this will break potential retain cycle introduced by the block capturing the scope example objective c weak typeof self weakself self self executeblock nsdata data nserror error weakself dosomethingwithdata data objective c self executeblock nsdata data nserror

dosomethingwithdata data weakself dosomethingwithdata data you should add these two lines as snippets to xcode and always use them exactly like this objective c weak typeof self weakself self strong typeof weakself strongself weakself here we dig further about the subtle things to consider about the weak and the strong qualifiers for self inside blocks to summarize we can refer to self in three different ways inside a block  using the keyword self directly inside the block  declaring a weak reference to self outside the block and referring to the object via this weak reference inside the block  declaring a weak reference to self outside the block and creating a strong reference to self using the weak reference inside the block case  using the keyword self inside a block if we use directly the keyword self inside a block the object is retained at block declaration time within the block actually when the block is copied blockscaveat but for sake of simplicity we can forget about it a const reference to self has its place inside the block and this affects the reference counting of the object if the block is used by other classes and and or passed around we may want to retain self as well as all the other objects used by the block since they are needed for the execution of the block objective c dispatchblockt completionblock nslog  self myviewcontroller mycontroller myviewcontroller alloc init self presentviewcontroller mycontroller animated yes completion completionhandler no big deal but what if the block is retained by self in a property as the following example and therefore the object self retains the block objective c self completionhandler nslog  self myviewcontroller mycontroller myviewcontroller alloc init self presentviewcontroller mycontroller animated yes completion self completionhandler this is what is well known as a retain cycle and retain cycles usually should be avoided the warning we receive from clang is objective c capturing self strongly in this block is likely to lead to a retain cycle here comes in the weak qualifier case  declaring a weak reference to self outside the block and use it inside the block declaring a weak reference to self outside the block and referring to it via this weak reference inside the block avoids retain cycles this is what we usually want to do if the block is already retained by self in a property objective c weak typeof self weakself self self completionhandler nslog  weakself myviewcontroller mycontroller myviewcontroller alloc init self presentviewcontroller mycontroller animated yes completion self completionhandler in this example the block does not retain the object and the object retains the block in a property cool we are sure that we can refer to self safely at worst it is nilled out by someone the question is how is it possible for self to be destroyed deallocated within the scope of a block consider the case of a block being copied from an object to another let s say mycontroller as a result of the assignment of a property the former object is then released before the copied block has had a chance to execute the next step is interesting case  declaring a weak reference to self outside the block and use a strong reference inside the block you may think at first this is a trick to use self inside the block avoiding the retain cycle warning this is not the case the strong reference to self is created at block execution time while using self in the block is evaluated at block declaration time  thus retaining the object apple documentation blockscaveat reports that for non trivial cycles however you should use this approach objective c myviewcontroller mycontroller myviewcontroller alloc init myviewcontroller weak weakmycontroller mycontroller mycontroller completionhandler nsinteger result myviewcontroller strongmycontroller weakmycontroller if strongmycontroller and and strongmycontroller dismissviewcontrolleranimated yes completion nil and and else and and probably nothing first of all this example looks wrong to me how can self be deallocated and be nilled out if the block itself is retained in the completionhandler property the completionhandler property can be declared as assign or unsafeunretained to allow the object to be deallocated after the block is passed around i can t see the reason for doing that if other objects need the object self  the block that is passed around should retain the object and therefore the block should not be assigned to a property no weak and strong usage should be involved in this case anyway in other cases it is possible for weakself to become nil just like the second case explained declaring a weak reference outside the block and use it inside moreover what is the meaning of trivial block for apple it is my understanding that a trivial block is a block that is not passed around it s used within a well defined and controlled scope and therefore the usage of the weak qualifier is just to avoid a retain cycle as a blockscaveat lot blockscaveat of blockscaveat online blockscaveat references blockscaveat  books effective objective c   blockscaveat by matt galloway blockscaveat and pro multithreading and memory management for ios and os x blockscaveat by kazuki sakamoto tomohiko furumoto discuss this edge case the topic is not well understood yet by the majority of the developers the real benefit of using the strong reference inside of a block is to be robust to preemption going again through the above  cases during the execution of a block case  using the keyword self inside a block if the block is retained by a property a retain cycle is created between self and the block and both objects can t be destroyed anymore if the block is passed around and copied by others self is retained for each copy case  declaring a weak reference to self outside the block and use it inside the block there is no retain cycle and no matter if the block is retained or not by a property if the block is passed around and copied by others when executed weakself can have been turned nil the execution of the block can be preempted and different subsequent evaluations of the weakself pointer can lead to different values i e weakself can become nil at a certain evaluation objective c weak typeof self weakself self dispatchblockt block weakself dosomething and and weakself nil and and preemption weakself turned nil weakself dosomethingelse and and weakself nil case  declaring a weak reference to self outside the block and use a strong reference inside the block there is no retain cycle and again no matter if the block is retained or not by a property if the block is passed around and copied by others when executed weakself can have been turned nil when the strong reference is assigned and it is not nil we are sure that the object is retained for the entire execution of the block if preemption occurs and therefore subsequent evaluations of strongself will be consistent and will lead to the same value since the object is now retained if strongself evaluates to nil usually the execution is returned since the block cannot execute properly objective c weak typeof self weakself self myobj myblock strong typeof self strongself weakself if strongself strongself dosomething and and strongself nil and and preemption strongself still not nil strongself dosomethingelse and and strongself nil else and and probably nothing return in an arc based environment the compiler itself alerts us with an error if trying to access an instance variable using the notation the error is very clear objective c dereferencing a weak pointer is not allowed due to possible null value caused by race condition assign it to a strong variable first it can be shown with the following code objective c weak typeof self weakself self myobj myblock id localval weakself someivar in the very end case  should be used only when the block is not assigned to a property otherwise it will lead to a retain cycle case  should be used when the block is assigned to a property case  it is related to concurrent executions when asynchronous services are involved the blocks that are passed to them can be executed at a later period and there is no certainty about the existence of the self object delegation is a widespread pattern throughout apple s frameworks and it is one of the most important patterns in the gang of four s book design patterns the delegation pattern is unidirectional the message sender the delegant needs to know about the recipient the delegate  but not the other way around the coupling between the objects is loosen the sender only knows that its delegate conforms to a specific protocol in its pure form delegation is about providing callbacks to the delegate which means that the delegate implements a set of methods with void return type while some methods have void return type and look like callbacks objective c void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath void tableview uitableview tableview didhighlightrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath others are definitely not objective c cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath bool tableview uitableview tableview canperformaction sel action forrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath withsender id sender when the delegant asks for some kind of information to the delegate object the direction implied is from the delegate to the delegant and to the other way around anymore this is conceptually different and a new name should be use to describe the pattern datasource objective c uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath nsinteger numberofsectionsintableview uitableview tableview moreover in the above  methods apple mixed the presentation layer with the data layer which is clearly ugly and in the end very few developers felt bad about it over times and even here we ll call delegate methods both methods with void return type and not void for simplicity to split the concepts the following approach should be used delegate pattern when the delegant needs to notify the delegate about event occurred datasource pattern when the delegant needs to fetch information from the datasource object here is a concrete example objective c class zocsignupviewcontroller protocol zocsignupviewcontrollerdelegate nsobject void signupviewcontrollerdidpresssignupbutton zocsignupviewcontroller controller protocol zocsignupviewcontrollerdatasource nsobject zocusercredentials credentialsforsignupviewcontroller zocsignupviewcontroller controller protocol zocsignupviewcontrollerdatasource nsobject interface zocsignupviewcontroller uiviewcontroller property nonatomic weak id zocsignupviewcontrollerdelegate delegate property nonatomic weak id zocsignupviewcontrollerdatasource datasource delegate methods should be always have the caller as first parameter as in the above example otherwise delegate objects could not be able to distinguish between different instances of delegants in other words if the caller is not passed to the delegate object there would be no way for any delegate to deal with  delegant object so following is close to blasphemy objective c void calculatordidcalculatevalue cgfloat value by default methods in protocols are required to be implemented by delegate objects it is possible to mark some of them as optional and to be explicit about the required method using the required and optional keywords as so objective c protocol zocsignupviewcontrollerdelegate nsobject required void signupviewcontroller zocsignupviewcontroller controller didprovidesignupinfo nsdictionary optional void signupviewcontrollerdidpresssignupbutton zocsignupviewcontroller controller for optional methods the delegant must check if the delegate actually implements a specific method before sending the message to it otherwise a crash would occur as so objective c if self delegate respondstoselector selector signupviewcontrollerdidpresssignupbutton self delegate signupviewcontrollerdidpresssignupbutton self sometimes you may need to override delegate methods consider the case of having two uiviewcontroller subclasses uiviewcontrollera and uiviewcontrollerb with the following class hierarchy uiviewcontrollerb uiviewcontrollera uiviewcontroller uiviewcontrollera conforms to uitableviewdelegate and implements cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath you want to provide a different implementation for the method above in uiviewcontrollerb an implementation like the following will work objective c cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath cgfloat retval  if super respondstoselector selector tableview heightforrowatindexpath retval super tableview self tableview heightforrowatindexpath indexpath return retval and  f but what if the given method was not implemented in the superclass uiviewcontrollera the invocation objective c super respondstoselector selector tableview heightforrowatindexpath will use the nsobject s implementation that will lookup under the hood in the context of self and clearly self implements the method but the app will crash at the next line with the following error terminating app due to uncaught exception nsinvalidargumentexception  reason uiviewcontrollerb tableview heightforrowatindexpath unrecognized selector sent to instance xd in this case we need to ask if instances of a specific class can respond to a given selector the following code would do the trick objective c cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath cgfloat retval  if uiviewcontrollera class instancesrespondtoselector selector tableview heightforrowatindexpath retval super tableview self tableview heightforrowatindexpath indexpath return retval and  f as code as the one above is ugly often it d be better to design the architecture in a way that delegate methods don t need to be overridden multiple delegation is a very fundamental concept that unfortunately the majority of developers are hardly familiar with and too often nsnotifications are used instead as you may have noticed delegation and datasource are inter object communication pattern involving only  objects  delegant and  delegate datasource pattern is forced to be  to  as the information the sender asks for can be provided by one and only one object things are different for the delegate pattern and it would be perfectly reasonable to have many delegate objects waiting for the callbacks there are cases where at least  objects are interested in receiving the callbacks from a particular delegant and the latter wants to know all of its delegates this approach maps better a distributed system and more generically how complex flows of information usually go in wide software a basic implementation is given here to unfold the concept even if in cocoa there are ways to store weak references in a data structure to avoid retain cycles here we use a class to hold a weak reference to the delegate object as single delegation does objective c interface zocweakobject nsobject

didretrieveentries entries   with the registerdelegate and deregisterdelegate methods it is easy to connect and disconnect cables between components if at some point in time a delegate object is not interested in receiving the callbacks from a delegant it has the chance to just unsubscribe this can be useful when there are different views waiting for some callback to update the shown info if a view is temporarily hidden but still alive it could make sense for it to just unsubscribe to those callbacks aspect oriented programming aop is something not well known in the objective c community but it should be as the runtime is so powerful that aop should be one of the first things that comes to the mind unfortunately as there is no standard de facto library nothing comes ready to use out of the box from apple and the topic is far from being trivial developers still don t think of it in nowadays an aspect can alter the behavior of the base code the non aspect part of a program by applying advice additional behavior at various join points points in a program specified in a quantification or query called a pointcut that detects whether a given join point matches in the world of objective c this means using the runtime features to add aspects to specific methods the additional behaviors given by the aspect can be either add code to be performed before a specific method call on a specific class add code to be performed after a specific method call on a specific class add code to be performed instead of the original implementation of a specific method call on a specific class there are many ways to achieve this we are not digging into deep here basically all of them leverage the power of the runtime as said for all the aop ish libraries the library does some cool magic with the runtime replacing and adding methods further tricks over the method swizzling technique the api of aspect are interesting and powerful objective c and id aspecttoken aspecthookselector sel selector withoptions aspectoptions options usingblock id block error nserror error id aspecttoken aspecthookselector sel selector withoptions aspectoptions options usingblock id block error nserror error for instance the following code will perform the block parameter after the execution of the method mymethod instance or class method that be on the class myclass objective c myclass

after each call of the selector parameter on any object of type myclass or on the class itself if the method is a class method we added an aspect on myclass for the method mymethod usually aop is used to implement cross cutting concern perfect example to leverage are analytics or logging in the following we will present the use of aop for analytics analytics are a popular feature to include in ios projects with a huge variety of choices ranging from google analytics flurry mixpanel etc most of them have tutorials describing how to track specific views and events including a few lines of code inside each class objective c void logbuttonpress uibutton button id gaitracker tracker gai sharedinstance defaulttracker tracker send gaidictionarybuilder createeventwithcategory ux action touch label button titlelabel text value nil build the code above sends an event with context information whenever a button is tapped things get worse when you want to track a screen view objective c void viewdidappear bool animated super viewdidappear animated id gaitracker tracker gai sharedinstance defaulttracker tracker set kgaiscreenname value stopwatch tracker send gaidictionarybuilder createappview build this should look like a code smell to the most of the experienced ios developers we are actually making the view controller dirty adding lines of code that should not belong there as it s not responsibility of the view controller to track events you could argue that you usually have a specific object responsible for analytics tracking and you inject this object inside the view controller but the problem is still there and no matter where you hide the tracking logic you eventually end up inserting some lines of code in the viewdidappear we can use aop to track screen views on specific viewdidappear methods and moreover we could use the same approach to add event tracking in other methods we are interested in for instance when the user taps on a button i e trivially calling the corresponding ibaction this approach is clean and unobtrusive the view controllers will not get dirty with code that does not naturally belongs to them it becomes possible to specify a spoc file single point of customization for all the aspects to add to our code the spoc should be used to add the aspects at the very startup of the app if the spoc file is malformed and at least one selector or class is not recognized the app will crash at startup which is cool for our purposes the team in the company responsible for managing the analytics usually provides a document with the list of things to track this document could then be easily mapped to a spoc file as the logic for the tracking is now abstracted it becomes possible to scale with a grater number of analytics providers for screen views it is enough to specify in the spoc file the classes involved the corresponding aspect will be added to the viewdidappear method  for events it is necessary to specify the selectors to send both screen views and events a tracking label and maybe extra meta data are needed to provide extra information depending on the analytics provider we may want a spoc file similar to the following also a plist file would perfectly fit as well objective c nsdictionary analyticsconfiguration return trackedscreens  class zocmainviewcontroller  label main screen   trackedevents  class

30383524, a heads up display for git an example of git radar git radar is a tool you can add to your prompt to provide at a glance information on your git repo it s a labour of love i ve been dogfooding for the last few years maybe it can help you too table of contents brew install michaeldfallen and formula and git radar echo export path path home and git radar and bashrc then run git radar to see the docs and prove it s installed to use git radar you need to add it to your prompt this is done in different ways depending on your shell add to your bashrc export ps ps git radar bash fetch note the escaping the is important ensuring prompt execution add to your zshrc export prompt prompt git radar zsh fetch note the escaping the is important ensuring prompt execution add to your config fish function fishprompt setcolor fishcolorcwd echo n promptpwd echo n git radar fish fetch setcolor normal echo n the prompt lists the file changes and whether they are staged unstaged or untracked prompt and meaning and git master a and we have  untracked files git master dm and we have  modifications and  deletions not yet staged to commit git master mr and we have  modification and a file renamed staged and ready to commit git master u and we have a conflict caused by us that we need to address git master m dm a and a combination of the above types each symbol represents a different change to a file these are based on what git considers has happened to the file symbol and meaning and a and a new added file d and a file has been deleted m and a file has been modified r and a file has been renamed c and a file has been copied u and a conflict caused by us t and a conflict caused by them b and a conflict caused by both us and them the color tells you what stage the change is at color and meaning and green and staged and ready to be committed i e you have done a git add red and unstaged you ll need to git add them before you can commit grey and untracked these are new files git is unaware of yellow and conflicted these need resolved before they can be committed the use of feature is controlled by the gitradarformat environment variable see customise your prompt customise your prompt for how to personalise this the prompt will show you the difference in commits between your branch and the remote your branch is tracking the examples below assume you are checked out on master and are tracking origin and master prompt and meaning and git master  and we have  commits to push up git master  and we have  commits to pull down git master   and our version and origins version of master have diverged the use of feature is controlled by the gitradarformat environment variable see customise your prompt customise your prompt for how to personalise this the prompt will also show the difference between your branch on origin and what is on origin and master this a is hard coded branch name which i intend to make configurable in the future this is the difference between the commits you ve pushed up and origin and master prompt and meaning and git m   my branch and we have  commits on origin and my branch that aren t on origin and master git m   my branch and there are  commits on origin and master that aren t on origin and my branch git m    my branch and origin and master and origin and my branch have diverged we ll need to rebase or merge the use of feature is controlled by the gitradarformat environment variable see customise your prompt customise your prompt for how to personalise this the prompt will show you whether and how many stashes you have stored prompt and meaning and git master  and we have one stash if you don t rely on this status you can always hide this part of the prompt by customising your prompt customise your prompt ensuring your refs are up to date i found can be a pain to streamline this git radar can be configured to auto fetch your repo when the fetch flag is used git radar will run git fetch asynchronously every  minutes this will only occur when the prompt is rendered and it will only occur on the repo you are currently in to use this feature when setting your prompt call git radar with fetch export ps ps git radar bash fetch note the escaping the is important ensuring prompt execution export prompt prompt git radar zsh fetch note the escaping the is important ensuring prompt execution you may also choose to fetch at a customized interval of time to do so add this to your bashrc zshrc export gitradarfetchtime seconds for example to fetch every  seconds instead of the default  minutes export gitradarfetchtime  you can also do this in the gitradarrc file gitradarfetchtime  git radar is highly customisable using a prompt format string the  features above remote commits local commits branch and file changes are controlled by the prompt format string feature and control string and remote commits and remote local commits and local branch and branch file changes and changes stashes and stash you can create any prompt shape you prefer by exporting gitradarformat with your preferred shape the control strings above will be replaced with the output of the corresponding feature examples gitradarformat and result and branch local changes and master m branch local changes and master  m often you will want certain parts of the prompt to only appear when there is content to render for example when in a repo you want branch but when out of a repo you don t want the appearing to do this the control strings support prefixes and suffixes prefixes and suffixes are separated from the feature name by and will only render if the feature would render format prompt prefix changes suffix in a repo prompt prefix m suffix outside a repo prompt the default prompt format uses this to add spaces only if the feature would render in that way the prompt always looks well spaced out no matter how many features are rendering when setting your prompt variable prompt in zsh and ps in bash it s important that the function executes each time the prompt renders that way the prompt will respond to changes in your git repo to ensure this you will need to escape the execution of the function there are two ways to do this  use to render raw characters export prompt git radar zsh export ps git radar bash  use to escape execution of the subshell export prompt git radar zsh export ps git radar bash you can configure the colour scheme in two ways export environment variables exporting environment variables or use an rc file setting an rc file to configure the prompt this way just add to your and bashrc or and zshrc an export directive with the value you want to change example change the branch colour in zsh in and zshrc export gitradarcolorbranch fg yellow example change the branch colour in bash in and bashrc export gitradarcolorbranch   m git radar supports multiple rc files one of these will be sourced when the prompt renders example change the branch colour in zsh in and gitradarrc gitradarcolorbranch fg yellow basic rc file create a file at and gitradarrc which sets the environment variables listed in configuration values configuration values using colour codes listed in either zsh colour codes zsh colour codes or bash colour codes bash colour codes depending on your shell shell specific rc file if you use both bash and zsh you can set rc files that are specific for those for bash create a file at and gitradarrc bash for zsh create a file at and gitradarrc zsh bash colour codes make use of the colours your terminal app claims to be red or green using one of these codes will only produce the colour your terminal claims so you should customise your colour scheme on your terminal as well as customising git radar note the bright colours can be shown as bold instead it depends on your terminal by default for example the mac osx terminal app uses the bright colours to provide  new lighter colours but some terminals only support  and will show the text as bold instead colour and code for text and code for background and and black and   m and   m red and   m and   m green and   m and   m yellow and   m and   m blue and   m and   m magenta and   m and   m cyan and   m and   m white and   m and   m bright black and   m and   m bright red and   m and   m bright green and   m and   m bright yellow and   m and   m bright blue and   m and   m bright magenta and   m and   m bright cyan and   m and   m bright white and   m and   m reset and  m and  m note the reset will set back to what your terminal claims as standard text and background zsh also provides a way to access the colours that your terminal claims as red or green  etc note the bright colours can be shown as bold instead it depends on your terminal by default for example the mac osx terminal app uses the bright colours to provide  new lighter colours but some terminals only support  and will show the text as bold instead colour and code for text and code

29465325, a cross platform debugger for go for more detail see the end of this readme how it works more detail go get github com and mailgun and godebug insert a breakpoint anywhere in a source file you want to debug  breakpoint if the breakpoint is in package main and you don t want to examine any imported packages you can just run godebug run gofiles arguments if you want to trace the program outside of the main package list the packages to trace in the instrument flag godebug run instrument pkgpkgpkg gofiles arguments if you are debugging a test use godebug test like you would use go test godebug test instrument pkgs packages finally you can cross compile a debugging binary using godebug build godebug build instrument pkgs o output package the compiled binary has no dependencies so you can build it locally and then debug on i e a staging server that s it see godebug help for the full usage the current commands are command and result and h elp and show help message n ext and run the next line s tep and run for one step c ontinue and run until the next breakpoint l ist and show the current line in context of the code around it p rint expression and print a variable or any other go expression q uit and exit the program consider this program package main import fmt func main fmt println hello world now let s modify it a bit package main bufio fmt func main fmt println fmt println hello world bufio newscanner os stdin scan fmt println hello world when we run this modified version we see fmt println hello world and then the program waits for input before proceeding we have just implemented a debugger for the first program it may not seem like much but this program implements two fundamental debugger behaviors  display the current state of the program and  do not proceed until instructed by the user furthermore the changes we made were straightforward and easy to automate insert import statements for bufio and os  if not already present in main  insert the statement fmt println quote next line in main  insert the statement bufio newscanner os stdin scan we could do exactly the same thing for any other program with a single line main function and it s not hard to see how to generalize this to multiple lines this in essence is what godebug does parse source code insert extra code that implements the behavior of a debugger for that program output and run the result godebug handles many more cases than this simple example and implements more interesting debugging behavior but the principle is exactly the same

files even if you re using a bridging header you don t have to use a subclass of mdcchooseview you can use the mdcswipetochoosesetup method on any uiview to enable swipe to choose in the following

sure that you have the docker installed then run the container docker run d name swarmdb p   v pwd and var and lib and swarm olebedev and swarmdb once a swarm server is listening incoming connections on ws and and       we can initiate connections but let s suppose that we can t talk ron over raw websocket then let s setup a javascript client project mkdir and myapp cd and myapp yarn add swarm and db graphql tag now we can initialize a client instance and connect it to the running server javascript import gql from graphql tag import swarmdb localstorage from swarm and db const swarm new swarmdb

initialized and ready to use re opens websocket connection to a database server returns a new timestamp based uuid use local uuids for nodes you don t want to send to the server javascript const dashboard swarm uuid local and and a local uuid works only for the current instance note that a local object can reference a shared object but not the other way round swarm has a graphql api on the client side server client communication employs ron state ops patches swarm offers graphql as a schema less interface to fetch and modify your data with basic mutations operations for specific crdts and with several additional directives see below graphql is used to describe declare the shape of the requested data tree key features data reactivity full or partial sub documents and sub collections as first class citizens every object has a globally unique swarm uuid see teh node directive graphql scalar uuid atom a scalar a union of scalar types graphql union atom string and int and float and boolean and uuid node is an interface of crdt which presented as a key and value object where a value is a union of atom and node and node internally each objects js prototype regardless its type has id  type and version fields additionally the set type has length field and lww type can also has length in case if all the user land field keys are numbers say index of array there are no native javascript arrays by default they can be produced by directives see below graphql interface node id string type string version string length int only for array like objects various of keys and values payload is a flat key and value object where keys are strings and values are atom s graphql interface payload various of keys and values both of these two root fields serve to declare the tree you intend to get as a result of the execution there is nothing special except that you don t need to define schema example let s subscribe to the last  users from the users collection javascript const query gql subscription users from int  to int  users node id users slice begin from end to username picture swarm execute query  data error off and and handle updates console log data users list and and prints array of users the difference between subscription and query is a data reactivity see more details here live static mutations are strictly defined and depend on crdts which are implemented all of them listed below graphql type mutation for lww set id uuid  payload payload bool for set add id uuid  value atom bool remove id uuid  value atom bool note that an error will be raised in case of type mismatch example suppose we have to add subdocument into user profile for that we need to have an identifier uuid for new node then we can put it into the parent document javascript and and define mutation const addsettings gql mutation addsettings uid uuid  patch payload  settingsid uuid  settings payload patchuserobject set uid patch createsettings set settingsid settings and and create a node id const settingsid swarm uuid and and define arguments const variables uid xkq github  and and user id patch settings settingsid  and and put new node ref into new field settingsid settings premium true  and and a settings object to add and and run the mutation await swarm execute query addsettings variables  resp console log resp data and and will print patchuserobject true createsettings true and and swarm execute resolves promise after all mutations were applied graphql directive node id uuid on field used to define which node of swarm graph should be unwrapped can be missed if the field already contains a uuid itself for nested objects graphql directive node id uuid on field subscription user node id xkq github version username dashboard node id dash local fetch locally presented node screen tasks node id tasks length list id slice begin  id title progress graphql directive static on field directive live on field once a static node was fetched from the server and cached it will be returned from the cache without network activity graphql subscription user node id xkq github static version username notifications slice begin  title read user node id xkq github version username notifications slice begin  live title read graphql directive weak on field adds more control to data flow management by default swarm tries to fetch a node from the server if no presented in the local cache so query or subscription can block an application if there is no open connection this directive tells the runtime to call back with null don t wait for the server response if the node is not presented in the local cache yet useful for offline work graphql user node id xkq github live weak username version you can identify if the node doesn t exist in the system the server by checking version field it contains  in version field graphql directive slice offset int  limit int on field directive reverse on field these directives are for array like objects and nodes they work exactly like array methods in javascript in fact they call these methods but before calling the method the runtime tries to cast the object and node to an array via array prototype slice call node for example let s subscribe to nodes changes with uuid messages  meta data of the set id version length and the first message with an author graphql subscription messages node id messages version length list id reverse slice begin  end  version text author id username picture graphql directive date on field this directive casts the value into the date javascript object works only for swarm uuid values or string representations graphql user node id xkq github lasttimemodified version date username graphql directive uuid on field this directive casts a string value into the uuid object works only for string representations notice priority of execution of directives from the first to the last query a graphql query and subscription wrapped with gql function variables variables object of the query and subscription mutations an object of mutations to bind it with swarm instance children a prop function which returns a component subtree children prop will be called with an object which contains fields data a result of query and subscription execution may be null if there is no result yet mutations an object with the same shape as a mutation prop but bound to the swarm instance and ready to call with variables or without error an error of operations if any uuid a function uuid uuid which returns a new uuid null if the swarm instance is not initialized yet see ensure ensure promisevoid javascript import gql from graphql tag import graphql from swarm react const query gql subscription list id uuid items node id id slice begin  title const create gql mutation

layer ron is stable and apis are frozen the client and the server are ready for building prototypes and kind of mvps but not production ready yet how do i manage collections of documents in swarm for documents use lww type and for collections use set type swarm is a json graph very much like in firebase or mongodb document and collection based approach the key difference is thet you can put references into the graph so no need to denormalize your data and keep your data as flat as possible opposite to it shape your data as deep as you want why graphql it s a declarative paradigm approach it allows shaping resulting data whatever you want without additional transformations and joins in user space also it s a good fit too due to graph nature of swarm data full graphql support schemas client side validation authentication and access control connector for postgres and others continuous queries a k a live queries
95142336, hi and welcome to go tooling in action this is a multi hour workshop so get ready for some intense learning after going through the whole content you will know about what tools can help you better write go code how to build artifacts from that code and how to understand the performance of your code once it s running you should be relatively familiar with go even though we won t be writing for a shorter and sweeter version of this workshop you can watch the video that i made for a conference and inspired me to create this workshop to go through this you will need the following the rest of the software we ll use is quick to install through go get  so do not worry yet the workshop is for now composed of three independent sections in the future one more section might be added regarding monitoring of running systems but for now that topic is out of the scope of this workshop this workshop is very new so some things might be missing or wrong if you find anything that seems broken please file an issue or even better send a pull request you will need to sign a cla you ll get the info once you send the pr these are places where you can find more information for go my favorite aspect of go is its community and you are now part of it too welcome as a newcomer to the go community you might have questions or get blocked at some point this is completely normal and we re here to help you some of the places where gophers tend to hang out are this is not an official google product experimental or otherwise  it is just code that happens to be owned by google

2300485, i made this because changing your mac address in mac os x is harder than it should be the biggest annoyance is that the wi fi card airport needs to be manually disassociated from any connected networks in order for the change to be applied correctly doing this manually every time is tedious and lame instead of doing that just run this python script and change your mac address in one command now for windows and linux too note for windows  while it may appear that this script does not work anymore it does the reason for this is that the change only appears in the network adapter properties in the control panel commands such as getmac or ipconfig will still show the original mac address even though it has been changed note this actually appears to depend on the nic network interface card i tested it with my desktop and ipconfig showed the change however it does not show the change on my laptop to see this for yourself follow the below steps  open control panel  click network and internet  click network and sharing center  on the panel to the left click change adapter settings  a new window will appear showing all of the network adapters right click the one that is currently active and enabled and click properties  near the top click the button that says configure  another window will open at the top click the advanced tab  in the list to the left select either network address or locally administered address this will depend on your system you should see your mac address in the text box to the right this mac address should change when you run this script on windows  if the text box is empty and not present is selected run the script once to generate a new mac address and follow the above steps the value checkbox should now be selected and there should be a new mac address in the text box pip install spoofmac easyinstall spoofmac or clone and download the repository and install with setup py ex git clone git and and github com and feross and spoofmac git cd spoofmac python setup py install if you re not using the system python because you use homebrew for example  make sure you add and usr and local and share and python and or equivalent to your path spoofmac installs a command line script called spoof mac py you can always see up to date usage instructions by typing spoof mac py help some short usage examples spoof mac py list ethernet on device en with mac address    be b  wi fi on device en with mac address    be b  currently set to    be b  bluetooth pan on device en spoof mac py list wifi wi fi on device en with mac address    be b f you can use the hardware port name such as spoof mac py randomize wi fi or the device name such as spoof mac py randomize en spoof mac py set       en while not always possible because the original physical mac isn t available  you can try setting the mac address of a device back to its burned in address using reset spoof mac py reset wi fi older versions of os x may call it airport instead of wi fi another option to reset your mac address is to simply restart your computer os x doesn t store changes to your mac address between restarts if you want to make change your mac address and have it persist between restarts read the next section os x doesn t let you permanently change your mac address every time you restart your computer your address gets reset back to whatever it was before fortunately spoofmac can easily be set to run at startup time so your computer will always have the mac address you want first make sure spoofmac is installed installation then run the following commands in terminal cat local macspoof plist and sed s and and usr and local and bin and spoof mac py and which spoof mac py and and tee local macspoof plist sudo cp local macspoof plist and library and launchdaemons cd and library and launchdaemons sudo chown root wheel local macspoof plist sudo chmod  local macspoof plist by default the above will randomize your mac address on computer startup you can change the command that gets run at startup by editing the local macspoof plist file sudo vim and library and launchdaemons and local macspoof plist    use ip command when available in more situations    use ip command when available ifconfig is deprecated on arch linux    increase mac address randomness    allow nd character in mac address to be a letter    warn when trying to use a multicast address    more python   compatibility fixes    python   compatibility fixes    python  support    fix for ubuntu      fix line endings dosunix    add windows and linux support thanks cj    fix valueerror too many values to unpack error    fix regression list command now shows current mac address    complete rewrite to conform to pep thanks tyler    original version

maintenance status deprecated to install videojs contrib hls with npm run npm install save videojs contrib hls download a copy of this git repository and then follow the steps in building building see contributing md and contributing md drop by our slack channel playback on the video js slack slack link get a copy of videojs contrib hls installation and include it in your page along with video js video id example video width  height  class video js vjs default skin controls source type application and x mpegurl var player videojs example video player play and script with video js  by default there is no flash support instead flash support is provided trying to use video js version  and want to include flash support you must include videojs contrib hls required but are recommended as a fallback option for browsers that don t have a native become a de facto standard for streaming video on mobile devices thanks to its native support on ios and android there are a number of reasons independent of platform to recommend the format though supports client driven adaptive bitrate selection delivered over standard http ports simple text based manifest format no proprietary streaming servers required unfortunately all the major desktop browsers except for safari are missing hls support that leaves web developers in the unfortunate position of having to maintain alternate renditions of the same video and potentially having to forego html based video entirely to provide the best desktop viewing experience this project addresses that situation by providing a polyfill for hls on browsers that have support for media source support flash you can deploy a single hls stream code against the regular html video apis and create a fast high quality video experience across all the big web device categories check out the full documentation docs and for details on how hls works and advanced configuration a description of the adaptive switching behavior docs and bitrate switching md is available too videojs contrib hls supports a bunch of hls features here are some highlights video on demand and live playback modes backup or redundant streams mid segment quality switching aes  segment encryption cea  captions are automatically translated into standard html caption text tracks  in manifest webvtt subtitles are automatically translated into standard html subtitle tracks timed id metadata is automatically translated into html metedata text tracks highly customizable adaptive bitrate selection automatic bandwidth tracking cross domain credentials support with cors tight integration with video js and a philosophy of exposing as much as possible with standard html apis stream with multiple audio tracks and switching to those audio tracks see the docs folder for info media content in instead of the mpeg ts container format you may pass in an options object to the hls source handler at player initialization you can pass in options just like you would for other parts of video js javascript and and html for html hls videojs video html withcredentials true and and flash for flash hls videojs video flash withcredentials true var options hls withcredentials true videojs video flash options html options some options such as withcredentials can be passed in to hls during player src javascript var player videojs some video id player src type application and x mpegurl  withcredentials true type boolean can be used as a source option can be used as an initialization option when the withcredentials property is set to true  all xhr requests for manifests and segments would have withcredentials set to true as well this enables storing and passing cookies from the server that the manifests and segments live on this has some implications on cors because when set the access control allow origin header cannot be set to  also the response headers require the addition of access control allow credentials header which is set to true for more info type boolean default false can be used as a source option can be used as an initialization option when the handlemanifestredirects property is set to true  manifest requests which are redirected will have their url updated to the new url for future requests type boolean can be used as an initialization option when the usecuetags property is set to true a text track is created with label ad cues and kind metadata the track is then added to player texttracks changes in active cue may be tracked by following the video js cue points api for text tracks for example javascript let texttracks player texttracks let cuestrack for let i  i texttracks length i and and   if texttracks i label ad cues     cuestrack texttracks i cuestrack addeventlistener cuechange  function let activecues cuestrack activecues   for let i  i activecues length i and and let activecue activecues i     console log cue runs from and activecue starttime and to and activecue endtime type boolean can be used as an initialization option try to use videojs contrib hls even on platforms that provide some level of hls support natively there are a number of platforms that technically play back hls content but aren t very reliable or are missing features like cea  captions support when overridenative is true if the platform supports media source extensions videojs contrib hls will take over hls playback to provide a more consistent experience note if you use this option you must also set videojs options html nativeaudiotracks and videojs options html nativevideotracks to false videojs contrib hls relies on audio and video tracks to play streams with alternate audio and requires additional capabilities only supported by non native tracks in video js type number can be used as an initialization option when the blacklistduration property is set to a time duration in seconds if a playlist is blacklisted it will be blacklisted for a period of that customized duration this enables the blacklist duration to be configured by the user type number can be used as an initialization option when the bandwidth property is set bits per second  it will be used in the calculation for initial playlist selection before more bandwidth information is seen by the player type boolean can be used as an initialization option when enablelowinitialplaylist is set to true it will be used to select the lowest bitrate playlist initially this helps to decrease playback start time this setting is false by default runtime properties are attached to the tech object when hls is in use you can get a reference to the hls source handler like this javascript var hls player tech iwillnotusethisinplugins true hls if you were thinking about modifying runtime properties in a video js plugin we d recommend you avoid it your plugin won t work with videos that don t use videojs contrib hls and the best plugins work across all the media types that video js supports if you re deploying videojs contrib hls on your own website and want to make a couple tweaks though go for it type object an object representing the parsed master playlist if a media playlist is loaded directly a master playlist with only one entry will be type function a function that can be used to retrieve or modify the currently active media playlist the active media playlist is referred to when additional video data needs to be downloaded calling this function with no arguments returns the parsed playlist object for the active media playlist calling this function with a playlist object from the master playlist or a uri string as specified in the master playlist will kick off an asynchronous load of the specified media playlist once it has been retreived it will become the active media playlist type number the number of milliseconds it took to download the last media segment this value is updated after each segment download completes type number the number of bits downloaded per second in the last segment download this value is used by the default implementation of selectplaylist to select an appropriate bitrate to play before the first video segment has been downloaded it s hard to estimate bandwidth accurately the hls tech uses a heuristic based on the playlist download times to do this estimation by default if you have a more accurate source of bandwidth information you can override this value as soon as the hls tech has loaded to provide an initial bandwidth estimate type number the total number of content bytes downloaded by the hls tech type function a function that returns the media playlist object to use to download the next segment it is invoked by the tech immediately before a new segment is downloaded you can override this function to provide your adaptive streaming logic you must however be sure to return a valid media playlist object that is present in player hls master overridding this function with your own is very powerful but is overkill for many purposes most of the time you should use the much simpler function below to selectively enable or disable a playlist from the adaptive streaming logic type function example only enabling representations with a width greater than or equal to  javascript var qualitylevels player qualitylevels for var i  i qualitylevels length i and and var quality qualitylevels i if quality width  quality enabled true else quality enabled false javascript player hls representations to see whether the representation is enabled or disabled call its enabled method with no arguments to set whether it is enabled and disabled call its enabled method and pass in a boolean value calling representation enabled true will allow the adaptive bitrate algorithm to select the representation while calling representation enabled false will disallow any selection of that representation example only enabling representations with a width greater than or equal to  javascript player hls representations foreach function rep if rep width  rep enabled true else rep enabled false type function the xhr function that is used by hls internally is exposed on the per player hls object while it is possible we do not recommend replacing the function with your own implementation instead the xhr provides the ability to specify a beforerequest function that will be called with an object containing the options that will be used to create the xhr request javascript player hls xhr beforerequest function options options uri options uri replace example com  foo com return options the global videojs hls also exposes an xhr property specifying a beforerequest function on that will allow you to intercept the options for all requests in every player on a page for consistency across browsers the video source should be set at runtime once the video player is ready javascript videojs hls xhr beforerequest function options modifications to requests that will affect every player return options var player videojs video player id player ready function this src type application and x mpegurl  for information on the type of options that you can modify see the standard html video events are handled by video js automatically and are triggered on the player object fired after the first segment is downloaded for a playlist this will not happen until playback if video js s metadata setting is none usage tracking events are fired when we detect a certain hls feature encoding setting or api is used these can be helpful for analytics and to pinpoint the cause of hls errors for instance if errors are being fired in tandem with a usage event indicating that the player was playing an aes encrypted stream then we have a possible avenue to explore when debugging the error note that although these usage events are listed below they may change at any time without a major version change hls usage events are triggered on the tech with the exception of the  hls reload error events which are triggered on the player each of the following usage events are fired once per source if and when detected and name and description and and and and and hls webvtt and master manifest has at least one segmented webvtt playlist and and hls aes and a playlist is aes encrypted and and hls fmp and a playlist used fmp segments and and hls demuxed and audio and video are demuxed by default and and hls alternate audio and alternate audio available in the master manifest and and hls playlist cue tags and a playlist used cue tags see usecuetags usecuetags for details and each of the following usage events are fired per use and name and description and and and and and hls gap skip and player skipped a gap in the buffer and and hls player access and player hls was accessed and and hls audio change and a user selected an alternate audio stream and and hls rendition disabled and a rendition was disabled and and hls rendition enabled and a rendition was enabled and and hls rendition blacklisted and a rendition was blacklisted and and hls timestamp offset and a timestamp offset was set in hls can identify discontinuities and and hls unknown waiting and the player stopped for an unknown reason and we seeked to current time try to address it and and hls live resync and playback fell off the back of a live playlist and we resynced to the live point and and hls video underflow and we seeked to current time to address video underflow and and hls error reload initialized and the reloadsourceonerror plugin was initialized and and hls error reload and the reloadsourceonerror plugin reloaded a source and and hls error reload canceled and an error occurred too soon after the last reload so we didn t reload again to prevent error loops and the hls tech supports timed encountered with embedded metadata an in band metadata text will automatically be created and populated with cues as they are encountered in the stream utf  encoded frames are mapped to cue points and their values set as the cue text cues are created for all other frame types and the data is attached to the generated cue javascript cue value data there are lots of guides and references to using text tracks around you can get metadata about the

policies that means that all the files that make up the stream must be served from the same domain as the page hosting the video player or from a server that has appropriate cors configured easy instructions are and most cdns should have no trouble turning cors on for your account issues that are currenty know about with workarounds if you want to help find a solution that would be appreciated as of version    ie and below are no longer supported edge has native support for hls but only in the mpeg ts container if you attempt to play an hls stream with fragmented mp segments

group parent artboard or previous sibling layer utilize simple mathematic expressions mathematic values as values such as   quickly resize artboards and update their layout preview export and copy artboards at different sizes in preview mode preview mode constraints are stored directly on a layer so no worries with layer names first and foremost we recommend downloading the example sketch document included in this repo linked to it above there are several examples included there examining the constraints used and playing around with the different options i e changing constraints re sizing artboards and pressing update layout makes things clearer there are  primary actions show and hide toolbar update layout edit constraints preview and toggle size all of the features the plugin provides are available via plugins fluid for convenience the plugin provides a toolbar that floats above the current document giving you quick access to all of the above actions toolbar readme and toolbar png constraint inspector readme and constraint inspector png this option shows the constraint inspector here you can edit all of the constraints for the currently selected layer next to each section align fixed size and pinning is a dropdown button pressing it opens a menu where you can set relativity constraint inspector relativity readme and constraint inspector relativity png adjusts the layers in the currently selected artboards to reflect your constraints pressing l while the constraint inspector is focused will also update layout preview mode readme and preview mode png opens a window allowing you to preview the selected artboard at a range of preset device and icon sizes you can also copy the preview artboard to paste into sketch didn t have a mobile design now you do  or export an image of the preview artboard at different scales x x x and so on toggle sizes readme and sizes popover png opens a popup where you can toggle the size of the current artboard between different presets or flip its orientation you can have fluid fade its floating ui inspector toolbar when they are not focused see plugins fluid settings if you have fixed width or fixed height checked and leave the value blank the plugin will lock the width or height to whatever the current height or width is in sketch this is useful in some cases where you want to ensure the height and width do not change but don t want to enter the existing height and width manually since the width and height of groups in sketch are dependent on their sub layers fluid does not actually resize the height or width of a group as that causes sketch to distort the layers within it rather it simulates that sizing when calculating the geometry of sub layers it s worth noting that while constraints you set on a symbol itself will not propagate to other instances of that symbol any constraints you set on its sub layers will if you set the width of a text layer but not its height the plugin will set the height of the text layer to the height of the text after reflow all of the values in fluid support mathematic expressions such as   or  and  and  and so on this becomes even more useful when you add percentages to the mix percentages are relative to the dimension of the axis they re on here s how that shakes out using  as your fixed width equals  of the relative layer s width using  as your fixed height equals  of the relative layer s height using  in the top or bottom pinnings equals  of the relative layer s height using  in the right or left pinnings equals  of the relative layer s width one neat application of this is that it enables padding between sibling layers e g parent group or artboard layer b top pinning  and   relativity previous sibling layer a layer a numbers in the constraint inspector text fields can be incremented or deincrement by  by pressing the up and down keys holding down shift  and up or down will increment by  pressing space while a text field is focused will toggle that constraint s checkbox you can search through the section names of the preset sizes list in both preview mode and when toggling sizes by prefixing your searches with s  i e s ios or s material normally fluid only searches among the preset names themselves if you have any questions comments become attacked by technical bugs or have ideas to improve the plugin ping us on twitter

balance between runtime memory and accuracy i believe the full resnet s low accuracy is due to overfitting because it has more parameters or perhaps the training could be done differently the results above were obtained with mirroring but not cropping using cropping slightly improves the results on the resnet by to    therefore it is used as the final model given the predictions for a frame each second it takes the argmax of those predictions and creates cut blocks of the movie where argmax equals the target and the score is greater than some threshold the gap size the minimum fraction of frames matching the target in each block and the score threshold are all adjustable ffmpeg supports a lot of codecs including mp avi flv mkv wmv and many more this model doesn t make use of any temporal information since it treats each image separately karpathy et al showed that other models which use multiple frames don t perform much better they have difficulty dealing with camera movement

improves the results for the resnet by for now the dataset is limited to two heterosexual performers but given the success of this method i plan to expand the number of categories due to the nature of

1591828, this project is archived squeel lets you write your active record queries with fewer strings and more ruby by making the arel awesomeness that lies beneath active record more accessible squeel lets you rewrite article where createdat   weeks ago article where createdat  weeks ago this is a good thing if you don t agree squeel might not be for you the above is just a simple example squeel s capable of a whole lot more keep reading in your gemfile gem squeel last officially released gem then bundle as usual if you d like to customize squeel s functionality by enabling core extensions for hashes or symbols or aliasing some predicates you can create a sample initializer with rails g squeel initializer squeel enhances the normal active record query methods by enabling them to accept blocks inside a block the squeel query dsl can be used note the use of curly braces in these examples instead of parentheses denotes a squeel dsl query stubs and keypaths are the two primary building blocks used in a squeel dsl query so we ll start by taking a look at them most of the other examples that follow will be based on this symbol less block syntax an important gotcha before we begin the squeel dsl works its magic using instanceeval if you ve been working with ruby for a while you ll know immediately that this means that inside a squeel dsl block self isn t the same thing that it is outside the block this carries with it an important implication strong instance variables and instance methods inside the block won t refer to your object s variables and methods and strong don t worry squeel s got you covered use one of the following methods to get access to your object s methods and variables  assign the variable locally before the dsl block and access it as you would normally  supply an arity to the dsl block as in person where and q and q name myname downside you ll need to prefix stubs keypaths and functions explained below with the dsl object  wrap the method or instance variable inside the block with my person where name my somemethodtoreturnaname stubs are for most intents and purposes just like symbols in a normal call to relation where note the need for doubling up on the curly braces here the first ones start the block the second are the hash braces person where name ernie you normally wouldn t bother using the dsl in this case as a simple hash would suffice however stubs serve as a building block for keypaths and keypaths are very handy a squeel keypath is essentially a more concise and readable alternative to a deeply nested hash for instance in standard active record you might join several associations like this to perform a query person joins articles comments person with a keypath this would look like person joins articles comments person a keypath can exist in the context of a hash and is normally interpreted relative to the current level of nesting it can be forced into an absolute path by anchoring it with a  like articles comments person this isn t quite so useful in the typical hash context but can be very useful when it comes to interpreting functions and the like we ll cover those later all of the arel predication methods can be accessed inside the squeel dsl via their method name an alias or an an operator to create arel predicates which are used in where or having clauses th sql and th th predication and th th operator and th th alias and th let s say we want to generate this simple query select people from people where people name joe blow all of the following will generate the above sql person where name joe blow person where name joe blow person where name eq joe blow person where name eq joe blow person where name joe blow not a very exciting example since equality is handled just fine via the first example in standard active record but consider the following query select people from people where people name like ernie and people salary  or people name like joe and people salary  to do this with standard active record we d do something like person where name like and salary or name like and salary  ernie   joe   with squeel person where name ernie salary  and name joe salary  here we re using and and to generate and and or  respectively there are two obvious but important differences between these two code samples and both of them have to do with context  to read code with sql interpolation the structure of the sql query must first be considered then we must cross reference the values to be substituted with their placeholders this carries with it a small but perceptible and annoying context shift during which we stop thinking about the comparison being performed and instead play count the arguments  or in the case of named and hash interpolations find the word the squeel syntax places both sides of each comparison in proximity to one another allowing us to focus on what our code is doing  in the first example we re starting off with ruby switching context to sql and then back to ruby and while we spend time in sql land we re stuck with sql syntax whether or not it s the best way to express what we re trying to do with squeel we re writing ruby from start to finish and with ruby syntax comes flexibility to express the query in the way we see fit that last bit is important we can mix and match predicate methods with operators and take advantage of ruby s operator precedence or parenthetical grouping to make our intentions more clear on the first read through and if we don t like the way that the existing predications read we can create our own aliases in a squeel configure block squeel configure do and config and config aliaspredicate islessthan lt person where salary islessthan  tosql and while we re on the topic of helping you make your code more expressive let s say you want to check if a person has a name like one of several possibilities names ernie  joe  mary person where name like or name like or name like  names but you re smart and you know that you might want to check more or less than  names so you make your query flexible person where name like names size join or  names yeah that s readable all right how about person where name likeany names i m not sure about you but i much prefer the latter in short you can add any or all to any predicate method and it would do what you expect when given an array of possibilities to compare against sifters are like little snippets of conditions that take parameters let s say that you have a model called article and you often want to query for articles that contain a string in the title or body so you write a scope def self titleorbodycontains string where title matches string and body matches string but then you want to query for people who wrote an article that matches these conditions but the scope only works against the model where it was defined so instead you write a class article activerecord base sifter titleorbodycontains do and string and title matches string and body matches string now you can write article where sift titleorbodycontains awesome or person joins articles where articles sift titleorbodycontains awesome or you can just modify your previous scope changing where to squeel def self titleorbodycontains string squeel title matches string and body matches string you can supply an activerecord relation as a value for a predicate in order to use a subquery so for example awesomepeople person where awesome true article where authorid in awesomepeople select id squeel adds a couple of enhancements to joins first keypaths can be used as shorthand for nested association joins second you can specify join types inner and outer  and a class in the case of a polymorphic belongsto relationship person joins articles outer note joins notable person outer these can also be used inside keypaths note joins notable person articles you can refer to these associations when constructing other parts of your query and they ll be automatically mapped to the proper table or table alias this is most noticeable when using self referential associations person joins children parent children where children name like ernie and children parent name like ernie and children parent children name like ernie keypaths were used here for clarity but nested hashes would work just as well you can also use a subquery in a join  squeel can only accept an activerecord relation class of subqueries in a join  use the chain with caution you should call as first to get a nodes as then call on to get a join node subquery orderitem group orderableid select orderableid sum quantity unitprice as amount seat joins payment outer subquery as seatorderitems on id seatorderitems orderableid outer select seatorderitems amount seats includes works similarly with joins it uses outer join defaultly in rails  you need to use references with includes together person includes articles comments person references all with a keypath this would look like person includes articles comments person references all person includes articles comments person with a keypath this would look like person includes articles comments person you can call sql functions just like you would call a method in ruby person select coalesce name no name given and you can easily give it an alias person person select coalesce name no name given as namewithdefault person namewithdefault name or no name given  depending on data when you use a stub symbol or keypath inside a function call it ll be interpreted relative to its place inside any nested associations person joins articles group articles title having articles max id id if you want to use an attribute from a different branch of the hierarchy use an absolute keypath as done here person joins articles group articles title having articles max id id you can use the standard mathematical operators and    and inside the squeel dsl to specify operators in the resulting sql or the op method to specify another custom operator such as the standard sql concatenation operator and and p person select name op and and  diddly as flanderizedname first p flanderizedname as you can see just like functions these operations can be given aliases to select more than one attribute or calculated attribute simply put them into an array p person select name op and and  diddly as flanderizedname  coalesce name no name given as namewithdefault first p flanderizedname p namewithdefault most of the new functionality provided by squeel is accessed with the new block style where all your existing code that uses plain active record where queries should continue to work the same after adding squeel to your project with one exception symbols as the value side of a condition in normal where clauses if you have any where clauses that use a symbol as the value side right hand side of a condition you will need to change the symbol into a string in order for it to continue to be treated as a value squeel changes the meaning of symbols in the value of a condition to refer to the name of a column instead of simply treating the symbol as a string literal for example this query person where firstname lastname produces this sql query in plain active record select people from people where people firstname lastname but produces this sql query if you are using squeel select people from people where people firstname people lastname note that this new behavior applies to the plain where style expressions in addition to the new where squeel style in order for your existing where clauses with symbols to continue to behave the same you must change the symbols into strings these scopes for example scope active where state active scope instate lambda and state and where state state should be changed to this scope active where state active scope instate lambda and state and where state state tos for further information see while the squeel dsl is the preferred way to access advanced query functionality you can still enable methods on symbols to access arel predications in a similar manner to metawhere squeel configure do and config and config loadcoreextensions symbol person joins articles comments where articles comments body matches hello this should help to smooth over the transition to the new dsl if you d like to support the continued development of squeel please consider to support the project in other ways use squeel in your apps and let me know if you encounter anything that s broken or missing a failing spec is awesome a pull request is even better spread the word on twitter facebook and elsewhere if squeel s been useful to you the more people who are using the project the quicker we can find and fix bugs

7428932, note i do not maintain this anymore i highly suggest using bettercap instead for arp and mitm needs automatically find the most active wlan users then spy on one of them and and or inject arbitrary html and js into pages they visit individually poisons the arp tables of the target box the router and the dns server if necessary does not poison anyone else on the network displays all most the interesting bits of their traffic and can inject custom html into pages they visit cleans up after itself also can be used to continuosly jam nearby wifi networks this has an approximate range of a  block radius but this can vary based off of the strength of your wifi card this can be fine tuned to allow jamming of everyone or even just one client cannot jam wifi and spy simultaneously prerequisites linux python scapy python nfqueue nfqueue bindings     aircrack ng python twisted beef optional  nmap nbtscan and a wireless card capable of promiscuous mode if you choose not to use the ip option tested on kali   in the following examples     will be the attacking machine and     will be the victim all options shell python lans py h b beef c code u ip ipaddress vmac

will arp scan the network compare it to a live running promiscuous capture and list all the clients on the network attempts to tag the targets with a windows netbios name and prints how many data packets they are sending and receiving the ability to capture data packets they send is very dependent on physical proximity and the power of your network card ctrl c when you re ready and pick your target which it will then arp spoof running lans py without argument will give you the list of active targets and upon selecting one it will act as a simple arp spoofer shell python lans py u p d ip

html into pages the victim visits first tries to inject it after the first head tag and failing that injects prior to the first and head tag this example will change the page title to owned shell python lans py pcap libpcapfilename ip     to read from a pcap file you must include the target s ip address with the ip option it must also be in libpcap form which is the most common anyway one advantage of reading from a pcap file is that you do not need to be root to execute the script shell python lans py a r     shell python lans py dns eff org example  the a option will spoof every single dns request the victim makes and when used in conjuction with r it will redirect them to r s argument address the victim will be redirected to stallman org     no matter what they type in the address bar example  this will spoof the domain eff org and subdomains of eff org when there is no r argument present with the a or dns arguments the script will default to sending the victim to the attacker s ip address if the victim tries to go to eff org they will be redirected to the attacker s ip shell shell python lans py normal usage c html code inject arbitrary html code into pages the victim visits include the quotes when selecting html to inject d open an xterm with driftnet to see all images they view dns domain spoof the dns of domain e g dns facebook com will dns spoof every dns request to facebook com or subdomain facebook com a spoof every dns response the victim makes effectively creating a captive portal page r option can be used with this r ipaddress only to be used with the dns domain option redirect the user to this ipaddress when they visit domain u prints urls visited truncates at  characters and filters image and css and js and woff and svg urls since they

uses a python nfqueue bindings queue wrapped in a twisted ireaddescriptor to feed packets to callback functions nfqueue bindings is used to drop and forward certain packets python s scapy library does the work to parse and inject packets injecting code undetected is a dicey game if a minor thing goes wrong or the server the victim is requesting data from performs things in unique or rare way then the user won t be able to open the page they re trying to view and they ll know something s up this script is designed to forward packets if anything fails so during usage you may see lots of injected packet for www domain com but only see one or two domains on the beef panel that the browser is hooked on this is ok if they don t get hooked on the first page just wait for them to browse a few other pages the goal is to be unnoticeable my favorite beef tools are in commands social engineering do things like create an official looking facebook pop up saying the user s authentication expired and to re enter their credentials danmcinerney org danmcinerney org

38952298, redux router  keep your router state inside your redux store interact with the router with the same api you use to interact with the rest of your app state serialize and deserialize router state works with time travel feature of redux devtools npm install save redux router install the version    via the previous tag npm install save redux router previous react router is a fantastic routing library but one downside is that it abstracts away a very crucial piece of application state  the current route this abstraction is super useful for route matching and rendering but the api for interacting with the router to  trigger transitions and  react to state changes within the component lifecycle leaves something to be desired it turns out we already solved these problems with flux and redux we use action creators to trigger state changes and we use higher order components to subscribe to state changes this library allows you to keep your router state inside your redux store so getting the current pathname query and params is as easy as selecting any other part of your application state import react from react import combinereducers applymiddleware compose createstore from redux import reduxreactrouter routerstatereducer reduxrouter from redux router import createhistory from history import route from react router and and configure routes like normal const routes route path and component app route path parent component parent and route and route and and configure reducer to store state at state router and and you can store it elsewhere by specifying a custom routerstateselector and and in the store enhancer below const reducer combinereducers router routerstatereducer and and app rootreducer and and you can combine all your other reducers under a single namespace like so and and compose reduxreactrouter with other store enhancers const store compose applymiddleware m m m  reduxreactrouter routes createhistory devtools createstore reducer and and elsewhere in a component module import connect from react redux import push from redux router and and use a selector to subscribe to state state q state router location query q  and and use an action creator for navigation push searchbox you will find a server rendering example in the repo s example directory redux router will notice if the router state in your redux store changes from an external source other than the router itself  e g the redux devtools  and trigger a transition accordingly integrating routing with redux react router redux lets react router do all the heavy lifting and syncs the url data to a history react router s apis directly and benefit from the wide array of documentation and examples there the readme for react router redux has a useful picture included here this approach while simple to use comes with a few caveats  the history location object does not include react router params and they must be either passed down from a react router component or recomputed  it is discouraged and dangerous to connect the store data to a component because the store data potentially updates after the react router properties have changed therefore there can be race conditions where the location store data differs from the location object passed down via react router to components react router redux encourages users to use props directly from react router in the components they are passed down to any rendered route components this means that if you want to access the location data far down the component tree you may need to pass it down or use react s context feature this project on the other hand takes the approach of storing the entire react router data inside the redux store this has the main benefit that it becomes impossible for the properties passed down by redux router to the components in the route to differ from the data included in the store therefore feel free to connect the router data to any component you wish you can also access the route params from the store directly redux router also provides an api for hot swapping the routes from the router something react router does not currently provide the picture of redux router would look more like this this approach also has its set of limitations  the router data is not all serializable because components and functions are not direclty serializable and therefore this can cause issues with some devtools extensions and libraries that help in saving the store to the browser session this can be mitigated if the libraries offer ways to ignore seriliazing parts of the store but is not always possible  redux router takes advantage of the routercontext to still use much of react router s internal logic however redux router must still implement many things that react router already does on its own and can cause delays in upgrade paths  redux router must provide a slightly different top level api due to  even if the route logic and matching is identical ultimately your choice in the library is up to you and your project s needs react router redux will continue to have a larger support in the community due to its inclusion into the reactjs github organization and visibility react router redux is the recommended approach for react router and redux integration however you may find that redux router aligns better with your project s needs redux router will continue to be mantained as long as demand exists a redux store enhancer that adds router state to the store a reducer that keeps track of router state a component that renders a react router app using router state from a redux store dispatch push and orders and and order id a bit more advanced example dispatch push pathname and orders  query filter shipping works similar to the push except that it doesn t create new browser history entry and and go back to the previous entry in browser history and and these lines are synonymous history go  history goback and and go forward to the next entry in browser history and and these lines are synonymous history go  history goforward const loginpage createconnector props  state  dispatch  const actioncreators bindactioncreators actioncreators dispatch const push actioncreators map ac ac push and and detect logins const didlogin state distinctuntilchanged state state loggedin filter state state loggedin and and redirect on login const redirect didlogin withlatestfrom push  and and use query parameter as redirect path state push push state router query redirect and and and do go go return combinelatest

93916919, this guide should help fellow researchers and hobbyists to easily automate and accelerate there deep leaning training with their own kubernetes gpu cluster and br therefore i will explain how to easily setup a gpu cluster on multiple ubuntu   bare metal servers and provide some useful scripts and yaml files that do the entire setup for you by the way if you need a kubernetes gpu cluster for other reasons this guide might be helpful to you as well why did i write this guide and br the second part bringing it to the cloud for extensive training takes always longer than thought is frustrating and involves usually a lot of pitfalls for this reason i decided to work on this problem and make the second part effortless easy and quick and br the result of this work is this handy guide that describes how everyone can setup their own kubernetes gpu cluster to accelerate their work the new process for the deep learning researchers and br the automated deep learning training with a kubernetes gpu cluster improves the process of brining your algorithm for training in the cloud significantly this illustration visualizes the new workflow that involves only two simple steps and br my inspiration for the project designed by langhalsdino resources and description jpg raw true my inspiration for the project disclaimer and br be aware that the following sections might be opinionated kubernetes is an evolving fast paced environment which means this guide will probably be outdated at times depending on the authors spare time and individual contributions due to this fact contributions are highly appreciated quick kubernetes revive quick kubernetes revive rough overview on the structure of the cluster rough overview on the structure of the cluster initiate nodes initiate nodes how to build your gpu container how to build your gpu container some helpful commands some helpful commands acknowledgements acknowledgements license license these articles might be helpful if you need to refresh your kubernetes knowledge the main idea is to have a small cpu only master node that controls a cluster of gpu worker nodes rough overview on the structure of the cluster designed by langhalsdino resources and system overview jpg raw true rough overview before we can use the cluster it is important to firstly initiate the cluster and br therefore each node has to be manually initiated and joined to the cluster this are the constraints for my setup i have been in some places tighter than necessary but this is my setup and it worked for me  master and ubuntu   and ssh access with sudo user and internet access and ufw deactivated not recommended but for ease of use and enabled ports udp and tcp      only if your apps need them these will be used to access services from outside of the cluster worker and ubuntu   and ssh access with sudo user and internet access and ufw deactivated not recommended but for ease of use and enabled ports udp and tcp   these instruction cover my experience on ubuntu   and may or may not be suited to transfer to other os s i have created two scripts that fully initiate the master and worker node as described bellow if you want to take the fast track just use them otherwise i recommended to read the step by step instructions h fast track setup script and h ok lets take the fast track copy the corresponding scripts on your master and workers and br furthermore make sure that your setup fits into my constraints master node the token will look like this  token f efxxxxxxxxee chmod and x init master sh sudo and init master sh ip of master worker node the port is usually  chmod and x init worker sh sudo and init worker sh token of master ip of master port h detailed step by step instructions and h master node  add kubernetes repository to the packagemanager sudo su apt get update apt get install y apt transport https cat eof and etc and apt and sources list d and kubernetes list apt get update  install docker engine kubeadm kubectl kubernetes cni sudo apt get install y docker engine sudo apt get install y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes cni sudo groupadd docker sudo usermod ag docker user echo you might need to reboot and relogin to make docker work correctly  since we want to build a cluster that uses gpus we need to enable gpu acceleration in the master node keep in mind that this instruction may become obsolete or change completely in a later version of kubernetes add gpu support to the kubeadm configuration while cluster is not initialized sudo vim and etc and systemd and system and kubelet service d and number kubeadm conf append execstart with the flag  feature gates accelerators true  so it will look like this execstart and usr and bin and kubelet kubeletkubeconfigargs feature gates accelerators true  ii restart kubelet sudo systemctl daemon reload sudo systemctl restart kubelet therefore you will need the ip of your master node furthermore this step will provide you with the credentials to add further worker nodes so remember your token  and br the token will look like this  token f efxxxxxxxxee   xxx xxx  sudo kubeadm init apiserver advertise address ip address  since kubernetes   changed from abac roll management to rbac we need to advertise the credentials of the user you will need to perform this step for each time you will log into the machine sudo cp and etc and kubernetes and admin conf home and sudo chown id u id g home and admin conf export kubeconfig home and admin conf  install network add on that your pods can communicate with each other kubernetes   has some requirements for the network add on some of them are and cni based networks and rbac support this googlesheet contains a selection of suitable network add on googlesheet network add on vergleich i will use wave works just because of my personal preference  ii you are ready to go maybe check your pods to confirm that everything is working kubectl get pods  all namespaces n if you want to tear down your master you will need to reset the master node sudo kubeadm reset worker node the beginning should be familiar to you and make this process a lot faster  add kubernetes repository to the packagemanager sudo su apt get update apt get install y apt transport https cat eof and etc and apt and sources list d and kubernetes list apt get update  install docker engine kubeadm kubectl kubernetes cni sudo apt get install y docker engine sudo apt get install y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes cni sudo groupadd docker sudo usermod ag docker user echo you might need to reboot and relogin to make docker work correctly  since we want to build a cluster that uses gpus we need to enable gpu acceleration in the worker nodes that have a gpu installed keep in mind that this instruction may become obsolete or change completely in a later version of kubernetes add gpu support to the kubeadm configuration while cluster is not initialized sudo vim and etc and systemd and system and kubelet service d and number kubeadm conf append execstart with the flag  feature gates accelerators true  so it will look like this execstart and usr and bin and kubelet kubeletkubeconfigargs feature gates accelerators true  ii restart kubelet sudo systemctl daemon reload sudo systemctl restart kubelet therefore you will need to remember the token from your master node so take a deep dive into your notes xd sudo kubeadm join token f efxxxxxxee   xxx xxx   finished check your nodes on your master and see if everything worked kubectl get nodes n if you want to tear down your worker node you will need to remove the node from the cluster and reset the worker node furthermore it will be beneficial to remove the worker node from the cluster on master kubectl delete node worker node name on worker node sudo kubeadm reset client in order to control your cluster e g your master from your client you will need to authenticate your client with the right user this will be easier trust me  and br instruction to add custom user will be added in the future  install kubectl on your client i have only tested it on may mac but linux should work as well i don t know about windows but who cares about windows anyway d and br on mac brew install kubectl  copy the admin authentication from the master to your client scp uai   xxx  and admin conf and kube and  add the admin conf configuration and credentials to kubernetes configuration you will need to do this for every agent export kubeconfig and kube and admin conf you are ready to use kubectl on you local client  ii you can test by listing all your pods kubectl get pods  all namespaces install kubernetes dashboard the kubernetes dashboard is pretty beautiful and gives script kiddies like me access to a lot of functionality in order to use the dashboard you will need to get your client running rbac will ensure it  you can perform this steps directly on the master or from your client  check if the dashboard is already installed kubectl get pods all namespaces and grep dashboard  if the dashboard isn t installed install it in order to have access to your dashboard you will need to be authenticated with you client  proxy the dashboard to your client kubectl proxy  access the dashboard within your browser by visiting      and ui      and ui this guide should help you to get a docker container running that needs gpu access for this guide i have chosen to build an example docker container that uses tensorflow gpu binaries and can run tensorflow programs in a jupyter notebook keep in mind that this guide has been written for kubernetes   therefore further changes can compromise this guide in order to get your nvidia gpu with cuda running you have to pass the nvidia driver and cuda libraries to your container so we will use hostpath to make them available to the kubernetes pod the actual path differ from machine to machine since they are set by your nvidia driver and cuda installation hostpath path and usr and lib and nvidia  and bin name bin hostpath path and usr and lib and nvidia  name lib mount the volumes with the driver and cuda in the right directory for your container these might differ due to specific requirements of your container volumemounts mountpath and usr and local and nvidia and bin name bin mountpath and usr and local and nvidia and lib name lib since you want to tell kubernetes that you need n gpus  you can define your requirements here resources limits alpha kubernetes io and nvidia gpu  thats it it is everything you need to build your kuberntes   container  kubernetes and docker and machine learning and gpus pure awesomeness my example gpu deployment yaml file describes two parts a deployment and a service since i want to make jupyter notebook available form the outside run kubectl apply to make it available to the outside kubectl create f deployment yaml the deployment yaml file looks like this apiversion extensions and vbeta kind deployment metadata name tf jupyter replicas  template metadata labels app tf jupyter spec volumes hostpath path and usr and lib and nvidia  and bin name bin hostpath path and usr and lib

156491119, safari rce sandbox escape and lpe to kernel for macos    install nasm and tornado brew install nasm pip install tornado check config py if you want to change the host or ports afterwards start the server with and server py and navigate to the shown url this exploit chain uses three different bugs to go from javascript code running inside safari to kernel mode code execution  an incorrect optimization in the dfg jit compiler that can be used to cause a type confusion  missing sandbox checks in launchd allowing sandboxed processes to spawn arbitrary non sandboxed processes  a logic bug in xnu allowing a process to override the bootstrap port of its child processes leading to an ipc mitm situation the exploit chain is implemented in six stages each located in its own subdirectory stage and the webkit exploit stage and the first stage payload written in assembly stage and the second stage payload to perform the sandbox escape stage and shell scripts to coordinate the remaining stages stage and a lpe to gain root stage and a lpe to gain kernel code execution libspc and reimplementation of the xpc protocol used by stages   and  every subdirectory with the exception of libspc and contains a file named make py which when executed performs any kind of build command necessary and creates a list of files to be served by the webserver the dfg jit compiler represents javascript code in its own intermediate representation ir  the data flow graph dfg typically one javascript expression will be translated to one or multiple ir instructions in this graph in the case of a constructor function the createthis instruction is emitted and is responsible for allocating the this object that is constructed by the function as an example the function function consructor  when called with new  would roughly be translated to v createthis return v looking at the abstractinterpreter we can see that the dfg jit compiler assumes that the createthis operation will not result in any side effects besides a heap allocation in fact this code function constructor obj return obj x will roughly be translated to the following dfg instructions here the structurecheck was moved to the beginning of the function by the typecheckhoistingphase structurecheck arg v createthis v loadoffset arg offset return v however that assumption is invalid as the slow path code for createthis can execute arbitrary javascript code in some cases in particular by using a proxy around the actual function the get trap for the prototype property will be called during the slow path handler for createthis as it needs to fetch the prototype object for the constructed object function constructor obj return obj x var handler get target propname and run js here modify the structure of the argument object etc and return target propname var constructorproxy new proxy constructor handler and and force jit compilation of constructorproxy as such it is now possible to modify the structure of an object without the jit compiler performing a bailout this bug can be used to construct addrof and fakeobj primitives as follows we compile the code for the case of a jsarray with unboxed double elements then in the callback transition to jsvalue elements afterwards the jit code will load a jsvalue from the array but treat those bits as a double and return them to us the following code will assign the address of leakme to the address property of the constructed object function infoleaker a this address a  var handler get target propname if trigger arg  leakme return target propname here we essentially do it the other way around we optimize code to store a double to an array with unboxed double elements then again transition to jsvalue elements in the callback the code will continue to write our controlled double in unboxed form to the backing storage when we later access that array element it will treat those bits as a jsvalue instead of a double the following code will write the unboxed double address into the backing buffer of a which we can then read out as jsvalue allowing us to inject jsvalues of our choosing into the engine function objfaker a address a  address var handler get target propname if trigger arg  return target propname as such we end up with the ability to write a double and treat is as jsobject pointer and vice versa this can be exploited as described in attacking javascript the exploit first achieves arbitrary process memory read and write by faking a floatarray then searches for the jit region mapped rwx and writes the stage shellcode there goal bootstrap stage  by writing a dylib to disk and loading it via dlopen a short assembly payload which essentially does the following  call confstr cs darwin user temp dir to obtain a path to a writable directory  create a new file named x dylib in the writable directory  write the stage dylib into the newly created file  load the dylib into the webcontent process through dlopen launchd exposes the legacy spawn rpc endpoint as routine  in subsystem  this api fails to validate whether the caller should be allowed to spawn processes and will just execve any binary on the system for the caller with controlled arguments since launchd is reachable through the bootstrap port this makes it possible to escape from the sandbox the exploit essentially runs curl server and pwn sh and bash and thus passes control to stage goal pop calc and bootstrap the remaining stages this executes open and applications and calculator app and establishes a reverse shell then fetches all files required for the remaining stages and runs the exploits in xnu the tasksetspecialport api allows callers to overwrite their bootstrap port which is used to communicate with launchd this port is inherited across forks child processes will use the same bootstrap port as the parent a security issue now arises if the child process is more privileged than the parent as is the case for example with sudo a setuid binary or kextutil having the com apple rootless kext management entitlement by overwriting the bootstrap port and forking a child processes we can now gain a mitm position between our child and launchd which our child expects to reach when sending messages to the bootstrap port the child process will ask launchd to resolve various mach and xpc services by resolving these services to other ports controlled by us we can also gain a mitm position with arbitrary system services used by our child process exploitation then depends on how those services are used by the attacked program to gain root we target the sudo binary and intercept its communication with opendirectoryd  which is used by sudo to verify credentials we modify the replies from opendirectoryd to make it look like our password was valid it appears that there was an attempt to fix this problem since libxpc which performs the communication with launchd verifies that the responses indeed come from a uid  and pid  launchd process however these checks are insufficient we can bypass them as follows to resolve opendirectoryd to our own port  register our own mach service e g net saelo hax with launchd using the bootstrapregister api  intercept the service lookup request to launchd and replace the string com apple system opendirectoryd api with net saelo hax  forward the request to launchd but leave the original reply port in place so launchd answers directly to the child process and the checks in libxpc in our child succeed all that remains now for a privilege escalation to root is to forward the messages between opendirectoryd and sudo but replace the authentication error reply with a success reply this exploits the same flaw as stage but this time targeting kextutil we intercept the connection to com apple trustd and spoof the certificate chain causing kextutil to think that our self signed kext is actually signed directly by apple kextutil proceeds roughly as follows when asked to load a kext from disk  verify the integrity of the kext by checking all signatures against the provided certificate  communicate with trustd to obtain the certificate chain and establish whether the root certificate is trusted  verify that the root of the certificate chain is an apple certificate  check whether the kext is user approved by talking to syspolicyd however if syspolicyd can not be reached kextutil simply proceeds this enables the following attack to load self signed kernel extensions  create a kext and sign it with a self signed certificate  run kextutil and resolve com apple trustd to our own service  intercept messages to trustd and reply with a hardcoded certificate chain of an official apple kext  block communication with syspolicyd e g by replacing com apple security syspolicy kext with net saelo lolno in service lookup requests to launchd kextutil will now load our kernel extension into the kernel

getgeonamescode capital getlatitude capital getlongitude arrays of administrative divisions countries states or cities are returned as collections  a modern way of implementing arrays some of the

object s name inflicted and shortened when necessary object name and and same effect object name and and same effect object toarray name and and same effect again by default we will use iso   country and iso   state classification therefore countries or states that don t have iso codes are not visible by default please note that fips   is a deprecated abandoned standard it s better not to rely on it  new states and and or countries won t appear in fips you can change subdivision standard with setstandard method country setstandard defaultmanager standardiso and and iso subdivisions country setstandard defaultmanager standardfips and and fips   subdivisions country setstandard defaultmanager standardgeonames and and geonames subdivisions this will affect getstates and getcountries output earth object got the following convenience methods earth getafrica and and get a collection of african countries earth geteurope and and get a collection of european countries earth getnorthamerica and and you can guess earth getsouthamerica earth getasia earth getoceania earth getcountries and and a collection of all countries earth withoutmicro and and only countries that have population of at

and instantiate a state directly based on id provided geonames or iso geonames iso   and fips are all unique codes so all three can be used to reference states in your data store city getcode and and this is always a geonames code for now city city build id and and instantiate a city directly based on id provided geonames city getlatitude and and city s latitude city getlongitude and and city s

and and and and countries and  and coming soon and  and tbc and and states and  and coming soon and  and tbc and may be reused by different language sdks by default geographer assumes that you use packagist composer to install language packages therefore we will expect them in vendor and folder there is no need to manually turn on an extra language but if you attempt to use a non existing language  expect an exception and language and countries and states and cities and package and and and and and and and english texts are included in the data package and are used as default metadata our main principles and goals are  be lightweight and independent  so that this package can be pulled anywhere alone  coverage  geographer should cover all countries and languages  be extensible  developers should be able to override and extend easily while not a number one priority at this stage we will try maintain reasonable cpu and memory performance some benchmarks inflating a city based on its id time  ms memory  bytes  add a basic spatial index  add some unit tests in addition to existing integration tests  add coverage information for language packages tell us about yours the mit

28347353,  linvodb is a node js and nw js and electron persistent db with mongodb and mongoose like features and interface mongodb like query language persistence built on levelup you can pick back end performant steady performance unaffected by db size queries are always indexed auto indexing live queries make the query get constantly up to date results schemas built in schema support efficient map and reduce and limit streaming cursors distributed dataset relationship to nedb  linvodb is based on nedb the most significant core change is that it uses levelup as a back end meaning it doesn t have to keep the whole dataset in memory linvodb also can do a query entirely by indexes meaning it doesn t have to scan the full database on a query in general linvodb is better for large datasets many objects or large objects because it doesn t keep the whole db in memory and doesn t need to always scan it linvodb does the entire query through the indexes nedb scans the db both linvodb and nedb play well with nw js node webkit linvodb can be initialized with the js only level js back end nedb is ultra fast because the db is in memory linvodb s performance is comparible to mongodb linvodb is faster for large datasets linvodb has live queries map and reduce and schema support both linvodb and nedb are unsuitable for huge datasets big data combining nedb s in memory data and linvodb s full indexed queries would yield even better performance if you want to sacrifice memory for query performance you can use linvodb with a backend that works like that or with leveldb and increased lru cache install initialize pick backend  javascript npm install linvodb level js for nw js using level js npm install linvodb leveldown for pure node js using leveldb initialize javascript var linvodb require linvodb and and the following two lines are very important and and initialize the default store to level js which is a js only store which will work without recompiling in nw js and electron linvodb defaults store db require level js and and comment out to use leveldb instead of level js and and set dbpath this should be done explicitly and will be the dir where each model s store is saved linvodb dbpath process cwd var doc new linvodb doc  and schema can be empty and initialization detailed javascript var linvodb require linvodb var modelname doc var schema and and non strict always can be left empty var options and and options filename and test db and and path to database not necessary and and options store db require level js and and options passed to levelup constructor var doc new linvodb modelname schema options and and new model doc is the constructor linvodb dbpath and and default path where data files are stored for each model linvodb defaults and and default options for every model insert and save  the native types are string  number  boolean  date and null you can also use arrays and subdocuments objects if a field is undefined  it will not be saved if the document does not contain an id field one will be automatically generated a  characters alphanumerical string the id of a document once set cannot be modified javascript and and construct a single document and then save it var doc new doc a  now new date  test this is a string doc b  and and you can modify the doc doc save function err and and document is saved console log doc id and and insert document s and and you can use the insert method to insert one or more documents doc insert a   function err newdoc console log newdoc id doc insert a   a   function err newdocs and and two documents were inserted in the database and and newdocs is an array with these documents augmented with their id and and if there s an unique constraint on a  this will fail and no changes will be made to the db and and err is a uniqueviolated error and and save document s and and save is like an insert except it allows saving existing document too doc save doc a  test save is handy  function err docs and and docs  is doc and and docs  is newly inserted document with a  and has an assigned id and and doing that with insert would throw an uniqueviolated error for id on doc because it assumes all documents are new  use find to look for multiple documents matching you query or findone to look for one specific document you can select documents based on field equality or use comparison operators lt  lte  gt  gte  in  nin  ne  regex  exists you can also use logical operators or  and and not see below for the syntax javascript var planet new linvodb planet  and schema can be empty and and and let s say our datastore contains the following collection planet save id id  planet mars  system solar  inhabited false satellites phobos  deimos  id id  planet earth  system solar  inhabited true humans genders  eyes true  id id  planet jupiter  system solar  inhabited false  id id  planet omicron persei   system futurama  inhabited true humans genders   id id  completedata planets name earth  number   name mars  number   name pluton  number   function and and finding all planets in the solar system planet find system solar  function err docs and and docs is an array containing documents mars earth jupiter and and if no document is found docs is equal to and and finding all inhabited planets in the solar system planet find system solar  inhabited true  function err docs and and docs is an array containing document earth only and and use the dot notation to match fields in subdocuments planet find humans genders   function err docs and and docs contains earth and and use the dot notation to navigate arrays of subdocuments planet find completedata planets name mars  function err docs and and docs contains document  planet find completedata planets  name earth  function err docs and and docs contains document  and and if we had tested against mars docs would be empty because we are matching against a specific array element and and you can also deep compare objects don t confuse this with dot notation planet find humans genders   function err docs and and docs is empty because genders  is not equal to genders  eyes true and and find all documents in the collection planet find  function err docs and and the same rules apply when you want to only find one document planet findone id id  function err doc and and doc is the document mars and and if no document is found doc is null and and end of save the syntax is field op value where op is any comparison operator lt  lte less than less than or equal gt  gte greater than greater than or equal in member of value must be an array of values ne  nin not equal not a member of exists checks whether the document posses the property field value should be true or false regex checks whether a string is matched by the regular expression contrary to mongodb the use of options with regex is not supported because it doesn t give you more power than regex flags basic queries are more readable so only use the regex operator when you need to use another operator with it see example below javascript and and lt lte gt and gte work on numbers and strings planet find humans genders gt   function err docs and and docs contains omicron persei  whose humans have more than  genders  and and when used with strings lexicographical order is used planet find planet gt mercury  function err docs and and docs contains omicron persei  and and using in nin is used in the same way planet find planet in earth  jupiter  function err docs and and docs contains earth and jupiter and and using exists planet find satellites exists true  function err docs and and docs contains only mars and and using regex with another operator planet find planet regex and ar and  nin jupiter  earth  function err docs and and docs only contains mars because earth was excluded from the match by nin when a field in a document is an array the query is treated as a query on every element and there is a match if at least one element matches javascript and and if a document s field is an array matching it means matching any element of the array planet find satellites phobos  function err docs and and docs contains mars result would have been the same if query had been satellites deimos and and this also works for queries that use comparison operators planet find satellites lt amos  function err docs and and docs is empty since phobos and deimos are after amos in lexicographical order and and this also works with the in and nin operator planet find satellites in moon  deimos  function err docs and and docs contains mars the earth document is not complete you can combine queries using logical operators for or and and  the syntax is op query query for not  the syntax is not query javascript planet find or planet earth  planet mars  function err docs and and docs contains earth and mars planet find not planet earth  function err docs and and docs contains mars jupiter omicron persei  and and you can mix normal queries comparison queries and logical operators planet find or planet earth  planet mars  inhabited true  function err docs and and docs contains earth if you don t specify a callback to find  findone or count  a cursor object is returned you can modify the cursor with sort  skip and limit and then execute it with exec callback javascript var planet new linvodb planet  and schema can be empty and var docdocdocdoc planet save doc id id  planet mars  system solar  inhabited false satellites phobos  deimos  doc id id  planet earth  system solar  inhabited true humans genders  eyes true  doc id id  planet jupiter  system solar  inhabited false  doc id id  planet omicron persei   system futurama  inhabited true humans genders   function and and no query used means all results are returned before the cursor modifiers planet find sort planet  skip  limit  exec function err docs and and docs is doc doc and and you can sort in reverse order like this planet find system solar sort planet  exec function err docs and and docs is doc doc doc and and you can sort on one field then another and so on like this planet find sort firstfield  secondfield  and and you understand how this works and and end of save you can use count to count documents it has the same syntax as find for example javascript and and count all planets in the solar system planet count system solar  function err count and and count equals to  and and count all documents via cursor planet find count function err count and and count equals to  map and reduce and filter and aggregate  besides the standard pagination and sorting cursor methods we have the filter  map and reduce modifiers before seeing the examples you should know that you can combine any of these modifiers in any order and way and all will be executed for example you can run a regular query with find and then run a reduce on it no matter how you combine those modifiers the order of execution is query filter sort limit and skip map reduce aggregate the basic syntax is cursor map function val return val cursor reduce function reducer ab  initial cursor filter function val return true and or false and and and truthy and falsy values accepted cursor aggregate function res and do something to the result of the query right before serving and return res javascript and and let s assume this dataset var planet new linvodb planet  and schema can be empty and planet save doc id id  planet mars  system solar  inhabited false satellites phobos  deimos  doc id id  planet earth  system solar  inhabited true humans genders  eyes true  doc id id  planet jupiter  system solar  inhabited false  doc id id  planet omicron persei   system futurama  inhabited true humans genders   function and and map and reduce capabilities planet find system solar sort planet  map function x return x planet reduce function a b return a and  and b  exec function err res and and res is earth jupiter mars and and the largest number of human genders planet find humans genders exists true map function x return x humans genders reduce function ab return math max ab   exec function errres and and res is  and and combine map and filter only and and as you can see you can use map if you want to project only a part of the data planet find filter function x return x planet length  map function x return planet x planet exec function errres and and res is planet jupiter  planet omicron persei  and and use aggregate to emulate count planet find aggregate function res return res length exec function errres and and res is  and and combine all the methods because we can planet find system solar and and we have mars earth jupiter remaining sort inhabited  limit  and and earth falls out we have mars jupiter filter function x return x planet length  and and only jupiter remains map function x return x planet reduce function ab return a and and b  planets are aggregate function res return res and  those are uninhabited and in the solar system with a long name exec function errres console log res and and planets are jupiter those are uninhabited and in the solar system with a long name and and end save live queries  once you have a cursor object returned by calling find without a callback you can turn it into a live query meaning the res property will always be up to date results from the query of course all modifiers such as limit  skip  sort  map  reduce  filter and aggregate will still apply an event will be emitted when the result is updated livequeryupdate on the model itself seriously consider if live queries can be utilized in your application if you need particular results continuously using live queries is extremely efficient since you don t have to re read the database but results are kept up to date as you update the documents javascript and and let s assume this dataset var planet new linvodb planet  and schema can be empty and planet save id id  planet mars  system solar  inhabited false satellites phobos  deimos  id id  planet earth  system solar  inhabited true humans genders  eyes true  id id  planet jupiter  system solar  inhabited false  id id  planet omicron persei   system futurama  inhabited true humans genders   function err docs var live planet find system solar sort inhabited  limit  live and and don t forget you can still use map reduce filter aggregate planet on livequeryupdate  function and and we ll log this twice once on the initial result and then again once we update document and and we won t get this emitted if we modify the dataset with documents that do not fit the query system solar console log live res settimeout function docs  inhabited false and and earth catastrophe docs  save and and save earth and and end save if you plan to use live queries with angularjs and update scope on the livequeryupdated event please be careful first i recommend using digest when possible instead of apply dirty check only the current scope second i recommend debouncing the event before running the scope apply event to avoid apply being called many times because of heavy db use at a moment  doc save you can use save on a document instance to re save it therefore updating it javascript and and let s use the same example collection as in the finding document part and and id id  planet mars  system solar  inhabited false and and id id  planet earth  system solar  inhabited true and and id id  planet jupiter  system solar  inhabited false and and id id  planet omicron persia   system futurama  inhabited true planet findone planet earth  function err doc doc inhabited false doc save function err and we have updated the earth doc and doc update query update options callback will update all documents matching query according to the update rules query is the same kind of finding query you use with find and findone update specifies how the documents should be modified it is either a new document or a set of modifiers you cannot use both together it doesn t make sense a new document will replace the matched docs the modifiers create the fields they need to modify if they don t exist and you can apply them to subdocs available field modifiers are set to change a field s value unset to delete a field and inc to increment a field s value to work on arrays you have push  pop  addtoset  pull  and the special each see examples below for the syntax options is an object with two possible parameters multi defaults to false which allows the modification of several documents if set to true upsert defaults to false if you want to insert a new document corresponding to the update rules if your query doesn t match anything if your update is a simple object with no modifiers it is the inserted document in the other case the query is stripped from all operator recursively and the update is applied to it callback optional signature err  numreplaced  newdoc numreplaced is the number of documents replaced newdoc is the created document if the upsert mode was chosen and a document was inserted note you can t change a document s id javascript and and let s use the same example collection as in the finding document part and and id id  planet mars  system solar  inhabited false and and id id  planet earth  system solar  inhabited true and and id id  planet jupiter  system solar  inhabited false and and id id  planet omicron persia   system futurama  inhabited true and and replace a document by another planet update planet jupiter  planet pluton   function err numreplaced and and numreplaced  and and the doc  has been replaced by id id  planet pluton and and note that the id is kept unchanged and the document has been replaced and and the system and inhabited fields are not here anymore and and set an existing field s value planet update system solar  set system solar system  multi true  function err numreplaced and and numreplaced  and and field system on mars earth jupiter now has value solar system and and setting the value of a non existing field in a subdocument by using the dot notation planet update planet mars  set data satellites  data red true   function and and mars document now is id id  system solar  inhabited false and and  data satellites  red true and and and and not that to set fields in subdocuments you have to use dot notation and and using object notation will just replace the top level field planet update planet mars  set data satellites    function and and mars document now is id id  system solar  inhabited false and and  data satellites  and and and and you lost the data red field which is probably not the intended behavior and and deleting a field planet update planet mars  unset planet true   function and and now the document for mars doesn t contain the planet field and and you can unset nested fields with the dot notation of course and and upserting a document planet update planet pluton  planet pluton  inhabited false  upsert true  function err numreplaced upsert and and numreplaced  upsert id id  planet pluton  inhabited false and and a new document id id  planet pluton  inhabited false has been added to the collection and and if you upsert with a modifier the upserted doc is the query modified by the modifier and and this is simpler than it sounds planet update planet pluton  inc distance   upsert true  function and and a new document id id  planet pluton  distance  has been added to the collection and and if we insert a new document id id  fruits apple  orange  pear in the collection and and let s see how we can modify the array field atomically and and push inserts new elements at the end of the array planet update id id  push fruits banana   function and and now the fruits array is apple  orange  pear  banana and and pop removes an element from the end if used with  or the front if used with  of the array planet update id id  pop fruits    function and and now the fruits array is apple  orange and and with pop fruits   it would have been orange  pear and and addtoset adds an element to an array only if it isn t already in it and and equality is deep checked i e addtoset will not insert an object in an array already containing the same object and and note that it doesn t check whether the array contained duplicates before or not planet update id id  addtoset fruits apple   function and and the fruits array didn t change and and if we had used a fruit not in the array e g banana  it would have been added to the array and and pull removes all values matching a value or even any query from the array planet update id id  pull fruits apple   function and and now the fruits array is orange  pear planet update id id  pull fruits in apple  pear   function and and now the fruits array is orange and and each can be used to push or addtoset multiple values at once and and this example works the same way with addtoset planet update id id  push fruits each banana  orange   function and and now the fruits array is apple  orange  pear  banana  orange  javascript and and if you have the document instance at hand you can just doc findone planet mars  function err doc doc remove function and and done doc remove query options callback will remove all documents matching query according to options query is the same as the ones used for finding and updating options only one option for now multi which allows the removal of multiple documents if set to true default is false callback is optional signature err numremoved javascript and and let s use the same example collection as in the finding document part and and id id  planet mars  system solar  inhabited false and and id id  planet earth  system solar  inhabited true and and id id  planet jupiter  system solar  inhabited false and and id id  planet omicron persia   system futurama  inhabited true and and remove one document from the collection and and options set to since the default for multi is false planet remove id id   function err numremoved and and numremoved  and and remove multiple documents planet remove system solar  multi true  function err numremoved and and numremoved  all planets from the solar system were removed  javascript and and hook like doc on save  function doc and and will be called before saving a document no matter if using save insert or update methods you can modify the document in this event it s essentially a hook doc on insert  function doc and and will be called before saving a new document again no matter if using save and insert and update methods you can modify the document in this event doc on remove  function doc and and before removing a document called with the document about to be removed doc on construct  function doc and and when a document is constructed and and after operation is complete doc on inserted  function docs and and called after inserting new documents is complete docs is an array of documents doc on updated  function docs and and called after updating documents is complete docs is an array of documents doc on removed  function ids and and called after removing documents is complete ids is an array of ids you can define a schema for a model allowing you to enforce certain properties to types string number date  set defaults and also define properties with getter and setter since schema support is implemented deep in linvodb you can query on fields which are getter and setter based and rely that types and defaults are always going to be enforced note when constructing a model with a schema please specify options object after the schema otherwise schema will be treated as options new linvodb name schema options schemas are defined as an object of specs for each property the spec can have properties type the type to be enforced can be string number date along with string  number  date alternative syntax can also be a regexp instance in case you want to validate against that expression default the default value must comply to the type obviously enumerable whether this property will be enumerable get getter cannot be used with type and default set setter cannot be used with type and default index  sparse  unique booleans whether to create an index and it s options if type is all you need you can shorthand the property to the type only e g name string you can also define a property as an array of by setting it to spec  for example string for an array of strings nested objects are supported javascript var person new linvodb person  name type string default nameless  and and default value age number and and shorthand to type created date address and and nested object line string line string department type string index true  and and you can use the schema spec to define indexes favnumbers number  and and array of firstname get function return this name split  var p new person and and p is name nameless  age  created and date when created and  address line  line  favnumbers p name  and and p name becomes  p created  and  and  and and p is  october  date object p favnumbers push  p favnumbers push  and and favnumbers will be   the string will be cast to a number p favnumbers push forty five and and nothing happens can t cast and and p favnumbers is   p name john smith and and p firstname is john p save function and and person is saved and and you can even query on virtual properties person find firstname john  function err res and res will be p and model static instance methods  javascript and and var doc new doc and and create a new instance and and or get it from query results doc remove function err and removes the document and doc save function err and saves the document and doc copy and and returns a copy of the document you can define additional functions for both the model and the document instances javascript planet static findallsolar  function cb return planet find system solar exec cb planet findallsolar function errres and res is all planets in the solar system and planet method findsamesystem  function cb return planet find system this system exec cb planet findone planet earth  function err doc doc findsamesystem function errres and res is all planets in the solar system and  indexing in linvodb is automatic although you can turn that off autoindex false in model options not recommended defining indexes in case you need you enforce a unique constraint happens with doc ensureindex fieldname name  unique true the full syntax is doc ensureindex options cb  where callback is optional and get passed an error if any usually a unique constraint that was violated ensureindex can be called when you want even after some data was inserted though it s best to call it at application startup the options are fieldname required name of the field to index use the dot notation to index a field in a nested document unique optional defaults to false enforce field uniqueness note that a unique index will raise an error if you try to index two documents for which the field is not defined sparse optional defaults to false don t index documents for which the field is not defined use this option along with unique if you want to accept multiple documents for which it is not defined you can remove a previously created index with doc removeindex fieldname cb note compound indexes are currently not supported promises with bluebird  even though linvodb does not support promises out of the box it can easily be javascript var linvodb require linvodb var promise require bluebird var planet new linvodb planet  promise promisifyall planet find proto and and as of this line linvodb apis now have promise returning methods with async suffix and and all the callback based apis are still there and will work as before planet find system solar limit  execasync then function docs and and use docs somehow catch function err and and handle errors and and or if you use es async and await var docs await planet find system solar limit  execasync and and use docs somehow catch err and and handle errors utilization  if you wish to add something here contact me at ivo linvo

97121551, this repository contains a bilstm crf implementation that used for nlp sequence tagging for example pos tagging chunking or named entity recognition the implementation is based on keras    and can be run with tensorflow    as backend it was optimized for python   and   it does not work with python   the architecture is described in our papers the implementation is highly configurable  so you can tune the different hyperparameters easily you can use it for single task learning as well as different options for multi task learning you can also use it for multilingual learning by using multilingual word embeddings this code can be used to run the systems proposed in the following papers the implementation was optimized for speed by grouping sentences with the same lengths together this implementation is multiple factors faster than the systems by ma et al or lample et al the training of the network is simple and the neural network can easily be trained on new datasets for an example see trainpos py trainpos py trained models can be stored and loaded for inference simply execute python runmodel py models and modelname h input txt pretrained models for some sequence tagging task using this lstm crf implementations are provided in pretrained models docs and pretrainedmodels md this implementation can be used for multi task learning  i e learning simultanously several task with non overlapping datasets the file trainmultitask py trainmultitask py depicts an example how the lstm crf network can be used to learn pos tagging and chunking simultaneously the number of tasks

something is broken and it shouldn t be or if you have further questions this repository contains experimental software and is published for the sole purpose of giving additional background details on the respective publication in order to run the code i recommend python   or higher the code is based on keras    and as backend i recommend tensorflow    i cannot ensure that the code works with

for the pos tagset from universal dependencies see the docker folder docker and for more information how to run these scripts in a docker container if enabled during the trainings process models are stored to the models folder those models can be loaded and be used to tag new data an example is implemented in runmodel py python runmodel py models and modelname h input txt this script will read the model models and modelname h as well as the text file input txt the text will be splitted into sentences and tokenized using nltk the tagged output will be written in a conll format to standard

probably use gmail and you probably get a lot of email i do just like me you re also likely to have a lot of filters that were once supposed to keep your inbox clean but every time you click filter messages like this  you remember the enormous list of filters you have and how it is only ever going to make things worse in the long run as a programmer i write code as a metaprogrammer i write code that writes code if only gmail filters could be written by a program oh wait they there s an import export function for gmail filters these filters are exported as xml and the import in turn takes xml files what this library does is generate xml that you can import here are some very simple examples of how gmail britta can make your life easier imagine you re on a discussion mailing list that you skim from time to time so you want to label email to that list and archive email from it so it doesn t clog up your inbox now from time to time someone will cc you an important message and you don t want to miss these what to do naively you define a filter like this list discuss lists some side project org to thisisme mydomain com archive label some side project but this also means email addressed to you but also sent to that list will be missing the some side project label this means you need two list discuss lists some side project org to thisisme mydomain com archive list discuss lists some side project org label some side project now this can get pretty hairy pretty quickly and if you ever have to change the filter e g  the list changes email addresses  you have to change two filters ugh with gmail britta it s just this gmailbritta filterset do filter has w list discuss lists some side project org label some side project archiveunlessdirected that s it this little piece of ruby code will generate these two filters and if the list address changes you just re import these filters easy if you have issued a search for to me on gmail in the last few months and you get email from icloud nee mobileme users  you ll notice that to me also matches the me in example me com this is very frustrating mostly because any filter as above that matches on to me will now also not archive email sent from a me com account with gmail britta you can define a set of emails that are yours and archiveunlessdirected will generate a filter that matches on those gmailbritta filterset me thisisme my private org  this is me bigco example com do filter has w list discuss lists some side project org archiveunlessdirected there are instances where you can t only match on the mailing list sometimes interesting stuff will be sent to one list that you want to read  and lots of unnecessary silliness will be sent there too so to put email with a certain subject into one label and to put all the rest into another you have to make multiple filters but gmail lacks if and else in filters you have to duplicate and correctly negate each filter s condition in the next one luckily you have gmail britta to help you out there gmailbritta filterset do filter has w list robots bigco com subject important label work and robots and important do not archive otherwise has w list robots bigco com subject chunder label work and robots and irrelevant archiveunlessdirected markread true otherwise has w list robots bigco com subject semirelevant label work and robots and meh archiveunlessdirected a lot of things going on here first i hope you notice that this looks similar to an if and else if statement second you may notice the liberal application of archiveunlessdirected  with an optional markread parameter third do check out the xml generated by this it s pretty horriffic but the filters do exactly what the code says  if the email is sent to that list and has important in the subject it gets labeled with the work and robots and important label and won t be archived unless another filter further down does archive that email  if the email does not match all the above criteria but is sent to that list and has chunder in the subject label it irrelevant archive it and mark the email as read  if the email does not match all the above criteria but is sent to that list and has semirelevant in the subject label it meh and archive it but don t mark it as read best to use gmail britta from a ruby script but install the gem first gem install gmail britta or include it in your gemfile gem gmail britta this is a simple script that generates filters for you require rubygems require gmail britta fs gmailbritta filterset me thisisme my private org do filter has w from asf boinkor net label from the author of gmail britta neverspam puts fs generate running this script will write to stdout the filter xml that you need redirect that to a file and upload it on the bottom of your gmail filter settings and you ll label email from me and archive it unless i email you specifically not that useful but with your own filters and the recipes above you should be able to make it work here are some things to note when performing filter fu with gmail a filter condition tops out at  chars apparently this fits a decent amount of conditions but something to be careful about there is no check in gmail britta against this but gmail will refuse to import or drop filters that violate this if you use archiveunlessdirected heavily you almost certainly want to check the don t override filters box in gmail s inbox preferences a lot of this is a bit hacky particularly the filter condition merge logic  as it started as a oneoff ruby script very sorry for any amateurish code you may encounter there are few tests but so far it does work for me let me know if this made your life harder or easier check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn t been implemented or the bug hasn t been fixed yet check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn t requested it and and or contributed it fork the project start a feature and bugfix branch commit and push until you are happy with your contribution make sure to add tests for it note that are only very few tests yet i would totally appreciate if you started fleshing out this suite but i wouldn t expect you to add much of anything please try not to mess with the rakefile version or history if you want to have your own version or is otherwise necessary that is fine but please isolate to its own commit so i can cherry pick around it copyright c  andreas fuchs see license txt for further details

23338118, the java microservice lib qbit is a reactive programming lib for building microservices json http websocket and rest qbit uses reactive programming to build elastic rest and websockets based cloud friendly web services soa evolved for mobile and cloud servicediscovery health reactive statservice events java idiomatic reactive programming for microservices everything is a queue you have a choice you can embrace it and control it you can optimize for it or you can hide behind abstractions qbit opens you up to peeking into what is going on and allows you to pull some levers without selling your soul qbit is a library not a framework you can mix and match qbit with spring guice etc this gives a nice fluent api for async programming employeeservice lookupemployee  then employee catcherror invoke qbit callbacks are now also reakt callbacks without breaking the qbit contract for callbacks dependency groupid io advantageous qbit and groupid version    release and version and dependency dependency groupid io advantageous qbit and groupid version    release and version and dependency compile io advantageous qbit qbit admin    release compile io advantageous qbit qbit vertx    release core features  write rest based async microservices write websocket based async microservices fast async rpc over websocket actor service queues using micro batching for high speed message passing strongly async typed event bus which can be distributed async low overhead metrics gathering which can be queried and distributed for doing fast lane analytics complex async call coordination with the reactor for reactive programming built in support for health checks and integration with tools like consul built in support for monitoring and integration with wire protocols like statsd built in support for service discovery with integration with health system dns srv records and consul integration with persistent queues our services can generate swagger files like idl for json and rest remote client proxies for websocket your interface is your idl deployed at several large fortune  companies qbit now works with vertx standalone or embedded you can also use qbit on non qbit projects it is just a lib qbit has inproc services rest microservices and websocket microservices as well as an in proc service event bus which can be per module or per app it supports workers and in memory services before we describe more here are two sample services requestmapping and todo service public class todoservice requestmapping and todo and count public int size requestmapping and todo and public list todoitem list requestmapping and adder service public class adderservice requestmapping and add and  and  public int add pathvariable int a pathvariable int b qbit philosophy at the end of the day qbit is a simple library not a framework your app is not a qbit app but a java app that uses the qbit lib qbit allows you to work with java util concurrent and does not endeavor to hide it from you just trying to take the sting out of it does it work we have used techniques in boon and qbit with great success in high end high performance high scalable apps we helped clients handle x the load with  and th the servers of their competitors using techniques in qbit qbit is us being sick of hand tuning queue access and threads boon and qbit humility policy ideas for boon and qbit often come from all over the web we make mistakes point them out as a developer of boon and qbit we are fellow travelers if you have an idea or technique you want to share we listen inspiration a big inspiration for boon and qbit was vertx akka go channels active objects apartment model threading actor and the mechanical sympathy papers qbit has ideas that are similar to many frameworks we are all reading the same papers qbit got inspiration from the lmax disruptor papers and this blog post about queues that blog post inspired us to try them out some of these theories are deployed at some of the biggest middleware backends and whose name brands are known around the world and thus qbit was born qbit also took an lot of inspiration by the great work done by tim fox on vertx the first project using something that could actually be called qbit albeit early qbit was using vertx on an web and mobile microservice for an app that could potentially have  million users it was this experience with vertx and early qbit that led to qbit development and evolution qbit is built on the shoulders of giants netty and vertx does qbit compete with spring disruptor no you could use qbit to write plugins for spring disruptor i suppose but qbit does not compete with spring disruptor spring boot and spring mvc no we use the same annotations but qbit is geared for high speed in memory microservices it is more like akka than spring boot qbit has a subset of the features of spring mvc geared only for microservices i e  websocket rpc rest json marshaling etc akka no well maybe akka has similar concepts but they take a different approach qbit is more focused on java and microservices rest json websocket than akka lmax disruptor no in fact we can use disruptor as on of the queues that qbit uses underneath the covers early benchmarks have been removed they were here qbit got a lot faster benchmarking qbit is a moving target at the moment links and reports will be created code examples basicqueue integer queue basicqueue create integer class  and and sending threads sendqueue integer sendqueue queue sendqueue for int index  index amount index and and sendqueue send index

receivequeue take and and other methods poll  pollwait  readbatch  readbatch count qbit is a queuing library for microservices it is similar to many other projects like akka spring reactor etc qbit is just a library not a platform qbit has libraries to put a service behind a queue you can use qbit queues directly or you can create a service qbit services can be exposed by websocket http http pipeline and other types of remoting a service in qbit is a java class whose methods are executed behind service queues qbit implements apartment model threading and is similar to the actor model or a better description would be active objects qbit does not use a disruptor but could it uses regular java queues qbit can do north of  million ping pong calls per second which is an amazing speed seen as high as m qbit also supports calling services via rest and websocket qbit is microservices in the pure web sense json http websocket etc qbit uses micro batching to push messages through the pipe queue io etc faster to reduce thread hand off qbit is a java microservice lib supporting rest json and websocket it is written in java but we could one day write a version in rust or go or c but that would require a large payday service pojo plain old java object behind a queue that can receive method calls via proxy calls or events may have one thread managing events method calls and responses or two one for method calls and events and the other for responses so response handlers do not block service one is faster unless responses block services can use spring mvc style rest annotations to expose themselves to the outside world via rest and websocket servicebundle many pojos behind one response queue and many receive queues there may be one thread for all responses or not they also can be one receive queue queue a thread managing a queue it supports batching it has events for empty reachedlimit startedbatch idle you can listen to these events from services that sit behind a queue you don t have to use services you can use queue s direct in qbit you have sender queues and receivers queues they are separated to support micro batching serviceendpointserver servicebundle that is exposed to rest and websocket communication eventbus eventbus is a way to send a lot of messages to services that may be loosely coupled clientproxy clientproxy is a way to invoke service through async interface service can be inproc same process or remoted over websocket non blocking qbit is a non blocking lib you use callbacks via java  lambdas you can also send event messages and get replies messaging is built into the system so you can easily coordinate complex tasks qbit takes an object oriented approach to service development so services look like normal java services already write but the services live behind a queue and thread this is not a new concept microsoft did this with dcom and com and called it active objects akka does it with actors and called them strongly typed actors the important concepts is that you get the speed of reactive and actor style messaging but you develop in a natural oop approach qbit is not the first qbit is not the only speed qbit is very fast there is a of course a lot of room for improvement but already m and tps inproc ping pong m m and tps event bus k tps rpc calls over websocket and json etc more work needs to be done to improve speed but now it is fast enough where we are focusing more on usability the json support uses boon by default which is up to x faster than other json parsers for the rest and json websocket and json use case reactive programming service discovery built in support for service discovery this includes integration with consul statservice built in support for stats the statservice can be integrated with statsd graphite grafana datadog etc to publish passive stats or you can query the stats engine and react to the stats counts timings and levels the statsservice is a reactive stats system that can be clustered the statservice is reactive in that your services can publish to it and query it and react based on the results you can implement things like rate limiting and react to an increased rate of something the servicediscovery system integrates with the healthsystem and consul to roll up each of your internal services that make up you micro service and publish the composite availably of your micro service to a single http endpoint or a dead mans switch in consul ttl talk is cheap let s look at some code you can get a detailed walk through in the wiki we have a lot of documentation already we will create a service that is exposed through rest and json to query the size of the todo list curl localhost  and services and todo service and todo and count to add a new todo item curl x post h content type application and json d name xyz  description xyz to get a list of todo items the todo example will use and track todo items package io advantageous qbit examples

requestmapping value and body and bytes  method requestmethod post public boolean bodypostbytes byte body string string new string body standardcharsets utf return string equals foo requestmapping

callback if the rest operation has no return or no callback then qbit sends a  accepted there may be times when you want to send a  created or some other code that is not an exception you can do that by setting code on requestmapping by default the code is  which means use the default behavior  for success  for one way message and  for errors requestmapping value and helloj  code  public void

is not a standard and neither is qbit  we found the spring annotations to be less verbose  more people use spring than java ee we wrote qbit for people to use we could easily support jax rs style annotations and we probably will since qbit focuses on json we do not need all of the complexity of jax rs or even all the features of the spring mvc annotations also we can literally use the actual spring annotations qbit and boon use a non type safe mechanism for annotations which means they are not tied to a particular lib you can define your own we hate vendor tie in even if it is an open source vendor we also support post get which is similar to jax rs now just start it up public static void main string args serviceendpointserver server new endpointserverbuilder build server

endpoints that are registered under the service name and randomly pick one servicediscovery includes consul based watching json files on disk and dns it is easy to write your own service discovery as well and plug it into qbit in the future we can roundrobin calls or shard calls to websocket service and and or provide auto fail over if the connection is closed we do this for the event bus that uses service discovery but it is not baked into websocket based client stubs yet the last client example uses websocket you could also just use rest and actually use the uri params that we setup rest is nice but it is going to be slower than websocket support qbit ships with a nice little http client we can use it you can use it to send async calls and websocket messages with the http client here

example we have two channels public static final string newhirechannel com mycompnay employee new public static final string payrolladjustmentchannel com mycompnay employee payroll an employee object looks like this public static class employee final string firstname final int employeeid this example has three services employeehiringservice benefitsservice and payrollservice these services are inproc services qbit supports websocket http and rest remote services as well but for now let s focus on inproc services if you understand inproc then you will understand remote the employeehiringservice actually fires off the events to other two services public class employeehiringservice public void hireemployee final employee employee int salary  system out printf hired employee s n  employee and and does stuff to hire employee and and sends events final eventmanager eventmanager servicecontext eventmanager eventmanager send newhirechannel employee eventmanager sendarray payrolladjustmentchannel employee salary notice that we call sendarray so we can send the employee and their salary the listener for payrolladjustmentchannel will have to handle both an employee and an int that represents the new employees salary you can also use event bus proxies so you do not have to call into the event bus at all the benefitsservice listens for new employees being

from the employeehiringservice so you can get your benefits and paid find more details here you can define your own interface to the event bus and you can use your own event buses with qbit each module in your service can have its own internal event bus to learn more read to really grasp qbit one must grasp the concepts of a callback a callback is a way to get an async response in qbit you call a service method and it calls you back client proxies can have callbacks public interface recommendationserviceclient void recommend final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback final string username callbacks are java  consumers with some optional extra error handling public interface callback t extends java util function consumer t default void onerror java lang throwable error and compiled code and services that can block should use callbacks thus if loaduser blocked in the following example it should really use a callback instead of returning a value public class recommendationservice private final simplelrucache string user users new simplelrucache  public list recommendation recommend final string username user user users get username if user null user loaduser username  return runrulesengineagainstuser user let s pretend loaduser has to look in a local cache and if the user is not found look in an off heap cache and if not found it must ask for the user from the userservice which must check its caches and perhaps fallback to loading the user data from a database or from other services in other words loaduser can potentially block on io our client does not block but our service does going back to our recommendationservice if we get a lot of cache hits for user loads perhaps the block will not be that long but it will be there and every time we have to fault in a user the whole system is gummed up what we want to be able to do is if we can t handle the recommendation request we go ahead and make an async call to the userdataservice when that async callback comes back then we handle that request in the mean time we handle recommendation lists requests as quickly as we can we never block so let s revisit the service the first thing we are going to do is make the service method take a callback before we do that let s set down some rules public class recommendationservice public void recommend final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback final string username now we are taking a callback and we can decide when we want to handle this recommendation generation request we can do it right away if there user data we need is in memory or we can delay it public void recommend final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback final string username and look for user in user cache and user user users get username and if the user not found load the user from the user service and if user null  else and call the callback now because we can handle the callback now and recommendationscallback accept runrulesengineagainstuser user  notice if the user is found in the cache we run our recommendation rules in memory and call the callback right away recommendationscallback accept runrulesengineagainstuser user the interesting part is what do we do if don t have the user loaded public void recommend final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback final string username and look for user in users cache and user user users get username and if the user not found load the user from the user service and if user null and load user using callback and userdataservice loaduser new callback user override public void accept final user loadeduser handleloadfromuserdataservice loadeduser recommendationscallback   username   here we use a callback to load the user and when the user is loaded we call handleloadfromuserdataservice which adds some management about handling the callback so we can still handle this call just not now public void recommend final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback final string username and look for user in users cache and user user users get username and if the user not found load the user from the user service and if user null and load user using lambda expression and userdataservice loaduser loadeduser handleloadfromuserdataservice loadeduser recommendationscallback  username   using lambdas like this makes the code more readable and terse but remember don t deeply nest lambda expressions or you will create a code maintenance nightmare use them judiciously what we want is to handle the request for recommendations after the user service system loads the user from its store public class recommendationservice private final simplelrucache string user users new simplelrucache  private userdataserviceclient userdataservice private blockingqueue runnable callbacks new arrayblockingqueue runnable  public void recommend final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback final string username  and handle defered recommendations based on user loads and private void handleloadfromuserdataservice final user loadeduser final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback and add a runnable to the callbacks queue and callbacks add new runnable override public void run list recommendation recommendations runrulesengineagainstuser loadeduser recommendationscallback accept recommendations   public class recommendationservice and handle defered recommendations based on user loads and private void handleloadfromuserdataservice final user loadeduser final callback list recommendation recommendationscallback and add a runnable to the callbacks list and callbacks add list recommendation recommendations runrulesengineagainstuser loadeduser recommendationscallback accept recommendations  the important part there is that every time we get a callback call from userdataservice  we then perform our cpu intensive recommendation rules and callback our caller well not exactly what we do is enqueue an runnable onto our callbacks queue and later we will iterate through those but when the recommendationservice can be notified when its queue is empty it has started a new batch and when it has reached a batch limit these are all good times to handle callbacks from the userdataservice queuecallback queuecallbacktype empty queuecallbacktype startbatch queuecallbacktype limit private void handlecallbacks flushserviceproxy userdataservice runnable runnable callbacks poll while runnable null runnable run runnable callbacks poll  it is important to remember when handling callbacks from another microservice that you want to handle callbacks from the other service before you handle more incomming requests from you clients essentially you have clients that have been waiting async waiting but still  and these clients might represent an open tcp and ip connection like an http call so it is best to close them out before handling more requests and like we said they were already waiting around with an open connection for users to load form the user service to learn more about callbacks plesae read qbit java microservice lib callback fundamentals rough cut qbit microservice lib working with callbacks public class serviceworkers public static roundrobinservicedispatcher workers public static shardedmethoddispatcher shardedworkers final shardrule shardrule you can compose sharded workers for in memory thread safe cpu intensive services  or workers for io or talking to foreign services or foreign buses here is an example that uses a worker pool with three service workers in it let s say you have a service that does something and and your pojo public class multiworker void dosomework   now this does some sort of io and you want to have a bank of these running not just one so you can do io in parallel after some performance testing you found out that three is the magic number you want to use your api for accessing this service public interface multiworkerclient void dosomework now let s create a bank of these and use it first create

workers and final multiworkerclient worker bundle createlocalproxy multiworkerclient class and workers now you could use spring or guice to configure the builders and the service bundle but you can just do it like the above which is good for testing and understanding qbit internals qbit also supports the concept of sharded services which is good for sharding resources like cpu run a rules engine on each cpu core for a user recommendation engine qbit does not know how to shard your services you have to give it a hint you do this through a shard rule public interface shardrule int shard string

53524489, it will also include some helpful tricks to make your debugging sessions a lot less stressful the tutorial is written in english but there are other translations available with help from the python community if you would like to see another other translation or are interested in helping out with translating the tutorial the tutorial works best if you use python   or python   and i will highlight the differences between the two versions if a pdb command differs to check what version of python you re using type the following in your terminal python version now that you know your version let s get to it before jumping into the code we should have a brief discussion about the importance of debugging and using a debugging tool for me these three points highlight the importance of a debugger with a debugger you can explore the state of a running program test implementation code before applying it follow the program s execution logic your program to stop it and apply the three points above debuggers are very powerful tools and they can speed up the debugging process a lot faster than using simple print statements everywhere for those of you who are veteran programmers you might agree with me that there is a correlation between the best programmers and the ones that know how to debug effectively by debugging effectively i mean being able to diagnose a problem and then treat the error with minimal difficulty using a debugger and learning how to use it properly will help you become an effective debugger it will take some time before you feel comfortable navigating around in a debugging environment but the purpose of this tutorial is to get your feet wet before you start using pdb in your own code base so we already talked about the purpose of a debugger and now it s time to see it in action first you should clone this repo if you haven t already done so if you don t have git installed i recommend using once you have git installed clone the repo by entering the following in your terminal now that you have the repo cloned let s navigate to the root of the project and take a look at the instructions given cd and path and to and pdb tutorial file instructions txt your boss has given you the following project to fix for a client it s supposed to be a simple dice game where the object of the game is to correctly add up the values of the dice for  consecutive turns the issue is that a former programmer worked on it and didn t know how to debug effectively it s now up to you to fix the errors and finally make the game playable to play the game you must run the main py file seems easy enough to begin let s try playing the game to see what s wrong to run the program type the following in your terminal python main py you should see something like this add the values of the dice it s really that easy what are you doing with your life  and and and and and and   and and and and and and   and and and and and and   and and and and and and   and and and and and and  sigh what is your guess seems like the previous programmer had a sense of humor nonetheless let s enter  since that is the total value of the dice sigh what is your guess  sorry that s wrong the answer is  like seriously how could you mess that up wins  loses  would you like to play again y and n weird it said the answer is  but that s clearly wrong alright maybe the dice addition is wrong but let s play the game again to figure it out looks like the prompt to play again is y so let s enter that now would you like to play again y and n y traceback most recent call last file main py  line  in module main file main py  line  in main gamerunner run file and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  line  in run ijustthrowanexception file and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and utils py  line  in ijustthrowanexception raise unnecessaryerror you actually called this function dicegame utils unnecessaryerror you actually called this function ok weird there was an exception that was thrown even though we used what was supposed to be a valid input i think it s safe to say that the program is broken so let s start the debugging process it s time to finally work with python s very own debugger pdb the debugger is included in python s standard library and we use it the same way we would with any python library first we have to import the pdb module and then call one of its methods to add a debugging breakpoint in the program the conventional way to do this is to add the import and call the method at the same line you would like to stop at this is the full statement you would want to include python import pdb pdb settrace where the method was called let s try it now by opening up the main py file and adding the breakpoint on line  file main py python from dicegame runner import gamerunner def main print add the values of the dice print it s really that easy print what are you doing with your life import pdb pdb settrace add pdb here gamerunner run if name main main cool now let s try to run main py again and see what happens python main py add the values of the dice it s really that easy what are you doing with your life and users and development and pdb tutorial and main py  main gamerunner run there we go we are now in the middle of the running program and we can start poking around i think the first issue we should solve is the proper summation of the dice values if you are familiar with python s interpreter a lot of that knowledge can be transferred to the pdb debugger however there will be a couple gotchas that we will get to in the advanced section regardless let s learn a couple commands that will help us solve the addition issue taken directly from the pdb documentation these are the five commands that once you learn them you won t know how you lived without them  l ist displays  lines around the current line or continue the previous listing  s tep execute the current line stop at the first possible occasion  n ext continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or it returns  b reak set a breakpoint depending on the argument provided  r eturn continue execution until the current function returns notice that there are brackets around the last part of every keyword the brackets indicate that the rest of the word is optional when using the command prompt for pdb this saves typing but a major gotcha is if you have a variable name such as l or n  then the pdb command takes precedence that is say you have a variable named c in your program and you want to know the value of c well if you type c in pdb  you will actually be issuing the c ontinue keyword which executes the program and only stops if it encounters a break point nb i and many other programmers discourage the use of short variable names such as a  b  gme  etc these carry no meaning and will confuse other people reading your code i m only demonstrating the issues you may encounter with pdb in the presence of shortened variable names nnb another helpful tool is the following h elp without argument print the list of available commands with a command as an argument print help about that command for the rest of the tutorial i will be using the shortened version of the commands and if i use a command that i have not introduced here i will explain what it does so let s begin with the first one l ist first last list source code for the current file without arguments list  lines around the current line or continue the previous listing with one argument list  lines starting at that line with two arguments list the given range if the second argument is less than the first it is a count nb the above description was generated by calling help on list to get the same output in the pdb repl type help l using list  we can examine the source code of the current file we are in the arguments for list lets you specify a given range of lines you wish to see which can be helpful if you are in some weird rd party package and you are trying to figure out why they can t get string encoding working true story nb in python   and above you can type ll long list which shows you source code for the current function or frame i use this all the time instead of l since it s much better knowing which function you are in than an arbitrary  lines around your current position let s try using l now in your already open pdb prompt type in l and look at the output  def main  print add the values of the dice  print it s really that easy  print what are you doing with your life  import pdb pdb settrace  gamerunner run  if name main  main if we want to see the whole file we can call the list function with the range  to  like so pdb l    from dicegame runner import gamerunner  def main  print add the values of the dice  print it s really that easy  print what are you doing with your life  import pdb pdb settrace  gamerunner run  if name main  main unfortunately we don t get that much information from this file alone but we do see that it is calling the run method of the gamerunner class at this point you might be thinking awesome i ll just set a pdb in the run method in the dicegame and runner py file that will work but there s an even easier way using the step command we will discuss next execute the current line stop at the first possible occasion either in a function that is called or in the current function your current line of execution should still be on  and you can tell the current line by looking at the outputted by the list command let s call the step command and see what happens and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run classmethod nice we re currently in the runner py file on line  which we can tell from this line and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run the problem is we don t have much context so run the list command to checkout the method  total   for die in self dice  total and   return total  classmethod  def run cls  probably counts wins or something  great variable name  and   c   while true awesome now we have some more context on the run method but we are currently on  let s step in one more time so that we enter the method itself and then run the list command to see our current position and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run  classmethod  def run cls  probably counts wins or something  great variable name  and   c   while true  runner cls  print round n format runner round as we can see we are on a terribly named c variable that will cause us a major issue if we try to call it remember the comment from earlier regarding the c ontinue command we are just before the while loop so let s enter the loop and see what else we can uncover continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or it returns from the current line type the n ext command followed by list notice a pattern and let s observe what happens and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run while true  classmethod  def run cls  probably counts wins or something  great variable name  and   c   while true  runner cls  print round n format runner round  for die in runner dice now our current line on the while true statement we can keep calling next indefinitely until the program throws an exception or terminates call next  more times to get to the for loop and then follow up next with list and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run runner cls and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run print round n format runner round and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run for die in runner dice  while true  runner cls  print round n format runner round  for die in runner dice  print die show  guess input sigh what is your guess  guess int guess at this current point if you continue to type the next command you will then iterate through the for loop for the length of the runner dice attribute we can take a look at the length of the runner dice by calling the len function around it in the pdb repl which should return  pdb len runner dice since the length is only  items we could iterate through the loop by calling next  times but let s say there were  items to iterate over or even  a better option would be to set a break point and then continue to that break point instead b reak filename lineno and function  condition without argument list all breaks with a line number argument set a break at this line in the current file with a function name set a break at the first executable line of that function if a second argument is present it is a string specifying an expression which must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored the line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon to specify a breakpoint in another file probably one that hasn t been loaded yet the file is searched for on sys path the py suffix may be omitted we re only going to pay attention to the first two paragraphs of b reak s description in this tutorial like i mentioned in the previous section we want to set a break point past the for loop so we can continue to navigate through the run method let s stop on  since this has the input function which will break and wait for a user input anyways to do this we can type b  and then continue to the break point pdb b  breakpoint  at and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run prints some dice and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run guess input sigh what is your guess we can also take a look at the break points that we have set by calling break without any arguments num type disp enb where  breakpoint keep yes at and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  breakpoint already hit  time to clear your break points you can use the cl ear command followed by the breakpoint number which is found in the leftmost column of the above output let s clear the breakpoint now by calling the clear command followed by  nb you can also clear all the breakpoints if you don t provide any arguments to the clear command pdb cl  deleted breakpoint  at and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  from here we can call next and execute the input function let s just type  for our guess and once we are back in the pdb repl call list so we can see the next few lines sigh what is your guess  and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  run guess int guess  for die in runner dice  print die show  guess input sigh what is your guess  guess int guess  if guess runner answer  print congrats you can add like a  year old  runner wins and   c and  remember that we are trying to find out why our guess wasn t correct on our first playthrough it seemed like there was an error with the guess runner answer equality condition we should check to see what the runner answer method is doing in case there might be an error there call next and then let s call step to step into the runner answer method and users and spiro and development and mobify and engineering meeting and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  answer def answer self  def reset self  self round   self wins   self loses   def answer self  total   for die in self dice  total and   return total i think i found the issue on line  it doesn t look like the total variable is adding up the values of the dice like we want it to let s see if we can fix that by checking whether a die has an attribute which would contain its value to get to line  you can either set a break point or just call next until you hit the first iteration once you re on   let s call the dir function on the die instance and check what methods and attributes it has total and  pdb dir die class  delattr   createdice  roll  show  value there is a value attribute after all let s call that and see what returns remember this value will probably be different than mine and just for fun let s make sure it is equal to the value that the die is showing by calling the show method as well pdb die value pdb die show n and and n and and n and and n nb if you want the newline character n to print as a newline call print with die show as its argument it looks like it works as expected and we re ready to fix the answer method however some of us may want to continue with the debugging process and catch all the errors in one go unfortunately we are once again stuck in this for loop you might think to set a break point at  and then call continue but there is actually a better way in this case continue execution until the current function returns the return is a great power user command that let s you examine the final outcome of a function while you could set a breakpoint at the return call the return pdb command will help if there are multiple return statements in a single function since it only follows the path of execution for a single return let s call the return command and get to the end of the function return and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  answer  return total  def answer self  total   for die in self dice  total and   return total  classmethod  def run cls  probably counts wins or something  great variable name  and  to check the value of the returned total variable you can call total here or look at the final value in line below the return output now to return back to the run method call the next command and you ll be back in your happy place at this point you can exit the pdb debugger by calling exit or ctrl and d same as the python repl with these five commands you should be able to figure out a couple other bugs and then follow along with a bit more advanced pdb examples here are a couple advanced pdb commands that you can also use execute the one line statement in the context of the current stack frame the bang command lets pdb know that the following statement will be a python command and not a pdb command where this is helpful is in the run method with the c variable like i mentioned in the beginning of the tutorial calling c in pdb will issue the continue command navigating in your pdb repl stop at  in the runner py file and from that point you can prefix c with the command and see what happens we get the intended result since  assigned c  pdb postmortem traceback none enter post mortem debugging of the given traceback object if no traceback is given it uses the one of the exception that is currently being handled an exception must be being handled if the default is to be used enter post mortem debugging of the traceback found in sys lasttraceback while both methods may look the same postmortem and pm differ by the traceback they are given i commonly use postmortem in the except block however we will cover the pm method since i find it to be a bit more powerful let s try and see how this works in practice open up the python repl by typing python in your shell in the root of this project from there let s import the main method from the main module and import pdb as well play the game until the we get the exception after trying to type y to continue the game import pdb from main import main main would you like to play again y and n y traceback most recent call last file main py  line  in module main file main py  line  in main gamerunner run file and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and runner py  line  in run ijustthrowanexception file and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and utils py  line  in ijustthrowanexception raise unnecessaryerror you actually called this function dicegame utils unnecessaryerror you actually called this function now let s call the pm method from the pdb module and see what happens pdb pm and users and development and pdb tutorial and dicegame and utils py  ijustthrowanexception raise unnecessaryerror you actually called this function look at that we recover from the point where the last exception was thrown and are placed in the pdb prompt from here we can examine the state the program was in before it crashed which will help you in your investigation nb you can also start the main py script using python m pdb main py and continue until an exception is thrown python will automatically enter postmortem mode at the uncaught exception

21064729, intro intro installation installation cocoapods cocoapods carthage carthage simple examples simple examples synchronous tasks synchronous tasks asynchronous tasks asynchronous tasks serial and concurrent tasks serial and concurrent tasks gcd queue control gcd queue control extensive example extensive example credit credit license license taskqueue is a swift library which allows you to schedule tasks once and then let the queue execute them in a synchronous manner the great thing about taskqueue is that you get to decide on which gcd queue each of your tasks should execute beforehand and leave taskqueue to do switching of the queues as it goes even if your tasks are asynchronious like fetching location downloading files etc taskqueue will wait until they are finished before going on with the next task last but not least your tasks have full flow control over the queue depending on the outcome of the work you are doing in your tasks you can skip the next task abort the queue or jump ahead to the queue completion you can further pause resume and stop the queue if you don t already have the cocoapods gem installed run the following command gem install cocoapods to integrate taskqueue into your xcode project using cocoapods specify it in your podfile pod taskqueue then run the following command pod install if you find that you re not having the most recent version installed when you run pod install then try running pod cache clean pod repo update taskqueue pod install also you ll need to make sure that you ve not got the version of taskqueue locked to an old version in your podfile lock file brew update brew install carthage to integrate taskqueue into your xcode project using carthage specify it in your cartfile github icanzilb and taskqueue here s the simplest way to use taskqueue in swift let queue taskqueue queue tasks and time consuming task on a background queue queue tasks and update ui on main queue queue run taskqueue will execute the tasks one after the other waiting for each task to finish and the will execute the next one by using the operators and and and you can easily set whether the task should execute in background or on the main queue more interesting of course is when you have to do some asynchronous work in the background of your tasks then you can fetch the next parameter in your task and call it whenever your async work is done let queue taskqueue queue tasks and result next in urlsession shared datatask with url completionhandler    in and and process the response next nil  queue tasks and print execute next task after network call is finished queue run print finished there are a few things to highlight in the example above  the first task closure gets two parameters result is the result from the previous task nil in the case of the first task and next next is a closure you need to call whenver your async task has finished executing  task nr  doesn t get started until you call next in your previous task  the run function can also take a closure as a parameter if you pass one it will always get executed after all other tasks has finished by default taskqueue executes its tasks one after another or in other words the queue has up to one active task at a time you can however allow a given number of tasks to execute at the same time e g if you need to download a number of image files from web to do this just increase the number of active tasks and the queue will automatically start executing tasks concurrently for example queue maximumnumberofactivetasks  this will make the queue execute up to  tasks at the same time note as soon as you allow for more than one task at a time certain restrictions apply you cannot invoke retry  and you cannot pass a result from one task to another  do you want to run couple of heavy duty tasks in the background and then switch to the main queue to update your app ui easy study the example below which showcases gcd queue control with taskqueue let queue taskqueue and and and adds a task to be executed on the current queue queue tasks and and and update the ui and and and adds a task to be executed in the background e g low prio queue and and stands for so so priority queue tasks and and and do heavy work and and and adds a task to be executed on the main queue and and stands for high priority queue tasks and and and update the ui again and and to start the queue on the current gcd queue queue run let queue taskqueue and and simple sync task just prints to console queue tasks and print tasks print task  run and and a task which can be asynchronious because it gets and and result and next params and can call next when ready and and with async work to tell the queue to continue running queue tasks and result next in print task  begin delay seconds  print task  end next nil and and a task which retries the same task over and over again and and until it succeeds i e util when you make network calls and and nb important to capture queue as weak to prevent and and memory leaks var cnt  queue tasks and weak queue result next in print task  try cnt cnt and  if cnt  next nil else queue retry delay  and and this task skips the next task in queue and and no capture cycle here queue tasks and print task  run print task  will skip next task queue skip queue tasks and print task  run and and this task removes all remaining tasks in the queue and and i e util when an operation fails and the rest of the queueud and and tasks don t make sense anymore and and nb this does not remove the completions added queue tasks and print task  run print task  will append one more completion queue run  in print completion appended completion run print task  will skip all remaining tasks queue removeall queue tasks and print task  run and and this either runs or resumes the queue and and if queue is running doesn t do anything queue run and and this either runs or resumes the queue and and and adds the given closure to the lists of completions and and you can add as many completions as you want also half way and and trough executing the queue queue run result in print completions print initial completion run run the included demo app to see some of these examples above in action author marin todorov taskqueue is available under the mit license see the license file for more info

state all actions performed and final redux state redaction customizable hooks allow for redaction of any sensitive information in redux state or in action payloads before bug submission easy playback of bug a global function window bugreporterplayback is available to replay any bug automatic logging of browser errors any calls to console error or window onerror are filed with a bug automatically automatic browser info logging all bugs filed automatically include window dimensions window location and user agent extensible extra properties passed in as meta to the redux bug reporter component are filed alongside the bug submit property can either be a url or a custom function that returns a promise this should allow redux bug reporter to work in any development environment integration with bug trackers ships with integration for jira github issues asana taiga and google sheets via sheetsu easy to write custom integration with other bug trackers integration documentation and docs and integrations md the easiest way to use redux bug reporter is to install it from npm and include it in your own build process webpack browserify etc npm install save redux bug reporter a umd build is also available link rel stylesheet href redux bug reporter and dist and redux bug reporter min css redux bug reporter puts minimal overhead on redux actions however it does keep copies of initial state final state on bug submission and full copies of all actions dispatched for an application with heavy actions such as network requests with large payloads or very frequent actions redux bug reporter will gradually take up more and more memory as such it s probably a good idea to disable in production by default the examples below demonstrate the expected common behavior of only enabling redux bug reporter in non production environments redux bug reporter disables itself by default if window is undefined so it will not negatively impact server side renders redux bug reporter can run in production it s assumed that an application usually wouldn t want the bug reporter to be displayed on the page and allow public users to file bugs but if that is the desired behavior redux bug

5460093, span class bigtitle javascript for cats and span javascript is a programming language or in other words a means by which a computer is instructed to do things just the same as one controls humans with hisses and meows one controls computers with statements written in a programming language all web browsers understand javascript and you can take advantage of that to make web pages do crazy things javascript started as a way to make web pages more interactive nowadays javascript runs in more places than just web browsers mdash it runs on web servers phones and even robots this page will teach you some javascript basics so that you can get up and running in no time actual time more than none probably an hour or two also since you are a cat you are less likely to run and more likely to lay around in the sun span class right cat images and yarnify png and span you will always land on your feet mdash even when programming unlike pawing over a glass of water images and dealwithit gif on your laptop nothing in these tutorials will damage your computer in any way even if you mistype a command or click the wrong button like cats computer programmers make mistakes all time misspelling things forgetting quotes or brackets and being forgetful of how basic functions and yarn lasers work programmers care more about making it work eventually rather than trying to make it work the very first time the best way to learn is by making mistakes so don t be a scaredy cat the absolute worst thing that will happen is that you might have to refresh this page in your web browser if you get stuck don t worry though this will happen very rarely there is javascript running on this page right now let s play around with it a little for the sake of simplicity i ll assume you are using google chrome to read this page if you aren t it s probably easier on both of us if you follow along with chrome first right click anywhere on the screen and hit inspect element  then click on the console tab you should see a thingy that looks like this console images and console gif this is a console otherwise known as a command line or terminal basically it s a way to type one thing at a time into a computer and immediately get the computers answer back they are super useful as a learning tool i still use the console nearly every day that i m coding the console does some pretty cool stuff here i have started to type something and the console is helping me out by giving me a list of all the possible things i could continue to type another thing you could do is type  and  into the console and then hit the enter key and watch what happens using the console is a very important part of learning javascript if you don t know if something works or what the command is for something go to the console and figure it out here s an example since i am a cat i want to replace every instance of the word dog on the internet with those blasted dogs first go into your console and type in a few sentences that contain the word dog at least once in javascript a bunch of letters numbers words or anything else is known as a string as in a string of characters strings have to begin and end with a quotation mark single or double is fine just make sure you use the same at the beginning as you do at the end console images and console strings gif see the nasty error message don t worry you didn t break any laws syntaxerror illegal is just the way it sounds when robots tell you that your program has a problem the first two sentences had matching quotation marks at the beginning and end but when i mixed single and double quotation marks it freaked out on me ok to fix up one of these sentences by replacing dog with our enhanced version we have to first save the original sentence so that we can call it up later when we do our replacing magic notice how the string gets repeated in red when we type it into the console this is because we haven t told it to save the sentence anywhere so it just gives it right back or it gives us an error back if we messed something up values are the simplest components in javascript  is a value true is a value hello is a value function is a value the list goes on there are a handful of different types of values in javascript but we don t need to go over them all right away mdash you will learn them naturally the more you code to store values we use things called variables the word variable means can change and is used because variables can store many different types of values and can change their value many times they are pretty much like mailboxes we put something in a variable like our sentence and then give the variable an address that we can use to look up the sentence later in real life mailboxes have to have po box numbers but in javascript you usually just use lowercase letters or numbers without any spaces console images and console variables gif var is shorthand for variable and the means store the thing on the right hand side in the thing on the left hand side also as you can see now that we are storing our sentence in a variable the console doesn t just return our sentence right away but instead gives us undefined which means there was nothing to return if you simply type a variable name into the console it will print out the value stored in that variable a note about variables is that by default they go away when you switch to a different page if i were to hit the refresh button in chrome for example my dogsentence variable would get wiped and it would be like it never existed but don t worry about this too much for now mdash you can just hit the up or down arrows on your keyboard while in the console to go through everything you ve entered in recently now that we have our sentence stored in a variable let s change a word stored in it we can do this by performing a function functions are a type of value that well serve a specific function aka purpose or action for us calling them actions sounded weird i guess so they went with the word function instead javascript has a function called replace that does exactly what we want functions take in any number of values in their parentheses zero one or many and return either nothing undefined or the changed string the replace function is available to use on any strings and takes in two values the characters to take out and the characters to swap in it gets confusing to describe these things so here is a visual example console images and console replace gif notice how the value of dogsentence is the same even after we run replace on it this is because the replace function and most javascript functions for that matter takes the value we give it and returns a new value  without modifying the value we passed in since we didn t store the result there is no on the left side of the replace function it just printed out the return value in our console console images and underscore gif you aren t limited to using other peoples functions mdash you can also write them yourself it s pretty easy let s make a function called makemoreexciting that adds a bunch of exclamation points to the end of a string function makemoreexciting string return string and in my head i read it out loud like this there s a function called make more exciting that takes in a string and returns a new copy of that string that has a bunch of exclamation points at the end here is how we would write this in the console manually if we weren t using a function console images and custom function manually gif the expression string and returns a new string and our variable called string stays the same as before since we never updated it to anything else with let s use our function instead of doing it manually first paste the function into the console and then call the function by passing in a string console images and custom function call gif you could also call the same function by passing in a variable that points to a string in the above example we just typed the string straight in there as a value instead of saving it to a variable first console images and custom function call variable gif the line makemoreexciting sentence is equivalent to saying sentence and what if we wanted to modify in place aka update the value of sentence simply save the return value of the function back into our sentence variable var sentence time for a nap sentence makemoreexciting sentence now sentence will have the exclamation marks in it note that you only have to use var when you are initializing a variable mdash the first time you ever use it after that you shouldn t use var unless you want to re initialize reset and clear and empty the variable what would happen if we took out the return statement in our function console images and custom function no return gif why is sentence empty because functions return undefined by default you can choose to return a value by return ing something functions should take in a value and if they change the value or create a new value that is supposed to be used later return a value fun fact a fancy term for this style is functional programming here is another function that doesn t return anything but instead uses a different method to show us the output function yellit string string string touppercase string makemoreexciting string console log string the last line of the function is another built in that simply takes in any values that you give it and prints them out into the console console images and custom function console log gif so is there something wrong with the above yellit function it depends here are the two major types of functions functions that modify or create values and return them functions take in values and perform some action that cannot be returned console log is an example of the second type of function it prints things out to your console mdash an action that you can see with your eyes but that cannot be represented as a javascript value my own rule of thumb is to try to keep the two types of functions separate from each other so here s how i would rewrite the yellit function function yellit string string string touppercase return makemoreexciting string console log yellit i fear no human this way yellit becomes more generic  meaning it only does one or two simple little things and doesn t know anything about printing itself to a console mdash that part can always be programmed later outside the function definition loops are one of the most important ways to harness the power of a computer remember underscore js from earlier make sure you have it loaded in the page remember you can just hit the up arrow on your keyboard a few times and then hit enter to load it in again if you need to and try copy and pasting this into your console function loganumber somenumber console log somenumber  times  loganumber console images and times loop png if we were to manually write out what times is doing in the above code it would look like this loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  loganumber  but cats refuse to do unnecessary manual work like this so we must always ask ourselves am i doing this in the laziest way possible so why is this called looping think of it like this if we were to write out a list of  numbers from  to  using a javascript array it would look like this var zerothroughten           what times really does is visit each number and repeat a task in the example above the task was to call the loganumber function with the current number repeating tasks in this way is referred to as looping over the array i ve mentioned these a few times but let s spend a minute learning about them imagine you need to keep track of all your buddies well an array will do just fine think of an array like a sorted list that you can keep tons of stuff in this is how you make one var mycatfriends bill  tabby  ceiling sweet now you have a list of your cat buddies elements that is what you call a single item in an array that are stored within arrays start at  and count up from there so mycatfriends  returns bill and mycatfriends  returns tabby etc etc to get buddies out of your brand new array you can just access an element directly like so console log mycatfriends  console images and array access png if you made a brand new cat friend at the hippest cat club the other night and you want to add them to your list it is super simple mycatfriends push super hip cat to check that the new cat made it into your array you can use length console images and array push length png notice how push returned the length handy also take note that arrays will always preserve ordering which means they will remember the order in which you added or defined things not everything in javascript preserves ordering so remember this special property of arrays arrays are good for lists but for other tasks they can be hard to work with consider our array of cat friends what if you also wanted to store more than just names var mycatfriends bill  tabby  ceiling var lastnames the cat  cat  cat var addresses the alley  grandmas house  attic sometimes it is nice to have all of the addresses or names in one variable but sometimes you have a cat in mind let s say bill and you just want to look up that cat s address with arrays it takes a lot of work because you can t just say hey array give me bill s address because bill is in one array and his address is in a totally different array console images and array lookup png this can be brittle because if our arrays change and we add a new cat to the beginning we would have to also update our billsposition variable to point to the new location of bill s information in the arrays here is a easier to maintain way to store information like this using objects var firstcat name bill  lastname the cat  address the alley var secondcat name tabby  lastname cat  address grandmas house var thirdcat name ceiling  lastname cat  address attic why would we do it this way because now we have a variable for each cat that we can use to get that cats values in a more convenient and readable way console images and object lookup png you can think of objects like keys on a keyring each one is for a specific door and if you have nice labels on your keys you can open doors very fast in fact the things on the left hand side of the are called keys are also known as properties and the things on the right hand side are values and and an object with a single key name and single value bill name bill so why would you ever use arrays if you can just put your data in objects because objects don t remember the order of the keys that you set you might enter in an object like this date  and  and   diary slept a bit today  name charles but the computer could give it back to you like this diary slept a bit today  name charles  date  and  and  or like this name charles  diary slept a bit today  date  and  and  so you can t ever trust the order of keys in objects if you wanna get really fancy you can make an array filled with objects or an object filled with arrays var moodlog date  and  and   mood catnipped date  and  and   mood nonplussed date  and  and   mood purring and and ordered from least to most favorite var favorites treats bird sighting  belly rub  catnip  napspots couch  planter box  human face when you combine different things like this you are making data structures  just like legos callbacks aren t really a feature of javascript like object or array  but instead just a certain way to use functions to understand why callbacks are useful you first have to learn about asynchronous often shortened to async programming asynchronous code by definition is code written in a way that is not synchronous synchronous code is easy to understand and write here is an example to illustrate uploadphototweet photo maxogden author s note i maxogden do happily accept random cat photo tweets this code is synchronous because in order for photo to get uploaded to the tweet the photo download must be completed this means that line  cannot run until the task on line  is totally finished if we were to actually implement this pseudo code we would want to make sure that download blocked execution until the download was finished meaning it would prevent any other javascript from being executed until it finished and then when the download completes it would un block the javascript execution and line  would execute synchronous code is fine for things that happen fast but it s horrible for things that require saving loading downloading or uploading what if the server you re downloading the photo from is slow or the internet connection you are using is slow or the computer you are running the code on has too many youtube cat video tabs open and is running slowly it means that it could potentially take minutes of waiting before line  gets around to running meanwhile because all javascript on the page is being blocked from being run while the download is happening the webpage would totally freeze up and become unresponsive until the download is done blocking execution should be avoided at all costs especially when doing so makes your program freeze up or become unresponsive let s assume the photo above takes one second to download to illustrate how long one second is to a modern computer here is a program that tests to see how many tasks javascript can process in one second function measureloopspeed var count  function addone count count and  and and date now returns a big number representing the number of and and milliseconds that have elapsed since jan   var now date now and and loop until date now is  milliseconds  second or more into and and the future from when we started looping on each loop call addone while date now now  addone and and finally it has been ms so let s print out our total count console log count measureloopspeed copy paste the above code into your javascript console and after one second it should print out a number on my computer i got   approximately   million in one second javascript can call the addone function   million times so if you have synchronous code for downloading a photo and the photo download takes one second it means you are potentially preventing   million operations from happening while javascript execution is blocked console images and bash sleep png javascript doesn t have a sleep function since you are a cat you are probably asking yourself why am i learning a programming language that does not involve sleeping but stay with me instead of relying on sleep to wait for things to happen the design of javascript encourages use of functions instead if you have to wait for task a to finish before doing task b you put all of the code for task b into a function and you only call that function when a is done for example this is blocking style code and this is in a non blocking style in the non blocking version b is a callback to a in the blocking version a and b are both called and invoked they both have after them which executes the functions immediately in the non blocking version you will notice that only a gets invoked and b is simply passed in to a as an argument in the blocking version there is no explicit relationship between a and b in the non blocking version it becomes a s job to do what it needs to do and then call b when it is done using functions in this way is called callbacks because your callback function in this case b  gets called later on when a is all done here is a pseudocode implementation of what a might look like function a done and and handle error if there was one if err console log uh oh  error and and call done when you are all done done think back to our non blocking example a b  where we call a and pass in b as the first argument in the function definition for a above the done argument is our b function that we pass in this behavior is something that is hard to wrap your head around at first when you call a function the arguments you pass in won t have the same variable names when they are in the function in this case what we call b is called done inside the function but b and done are just variable names that point to the same underlying function usually callback functions are labelled something like done or callback to make it clear that they are functions that should be called when the current function is done so as long as a does it s job and called b when it is done both a and b get called in both the non blocking and blocking versions the difference is that in the non blocking version we don t have to halt execution of javascript in general non blocking style is where you write every function so that it can return as soon as possible without ever blocking to drive the point home even further if a takes one second to complete and you use the blocking version it means you can only do one thing if you use the non blocking version aka use callbacks you can do literally millions of other things in that same second which means you can finish your work millions of times faster and sleep the rest of the day remember programming is all about laziness and you should be the one sleeping not your computer hopefully you can see now that callbacks are just functions that call other functions after some asynchronous task common examples of asynchronous tasks are things like reading a photo downloading a song uploading a picture talking to a database waiting for a user to hit a key or click on someone etc anything that takes time javascript is really great at handling asynchronous tasks like these as long as you take the time to learn how to use callbacks and keep your javascript from being blocked this is just the beginning of your relationship with javascript you can t learn it all at once but you should find what works for you and try to learn all of the concepts here i d recommend coming back again tomorrow and going through the entire thing again from the beginning it might take a few times through before you get everything programming is hard just try to avoid reading this page in any rooms that contain shiny objects they can be incredibly distracting javascript for cats skips over lots of details that aren t important for getting started cats are not known for their attention spans  but if you feel like you need to dive in deeper then check these out center satisfied

return a  seo friendly   response to the new host or false to don t redirect  by default you may want to create middleware in a lazy way under some circunstances the middleware is needed only in a specific context for example in development environments the middleware creation is expensive and is not needed always because a previous middleware returns a cached response the middleware is needed only in a specific path to handle with this you can use the middleware create method that must return a callable or false example use psrmiddlewares middleware middlewares and and this middleware can return a cached response and and so the next middleware may not be executed middleware cache mypsrcachepool  and and let s say this middleware is expensive so use a proxy for lazy creation middleware create function use app return middleware aurarouter app get router and and this middleware is needed only in production middleware create function return getenv env production false middleware minify and and this middleware is needed in some cases middleware create function request response if request hasheader foo return middleware www  return false and and this middleware is needed only in a specific basepath middleware create and admin  function return middleware digestauthentication user pass and and this middleware is needed in some cases under a specific basepath middleware create and actions  function request response if request hasheader foo return middleware responsetime  return false some middleware pieces use different functions to change the http messages depending of some circunstances for example payload payload parses the raw body content and the method used depends of the type of the content it can be json urlencoded csv etc other example is the minify minify middleware that needs a different minifier for each format html css js etc  or the gzip gzip that depending of the accept encoding header use a different method to compress the response body the interface psrmiddlewares transformers resolverinterface provides a way to resolve and returns the apropiate transformer in each case the transformer is just a callable with a specific signature you can create custom resolvers or extend the included in this package to add your owns let s see an example use psrmiddlewares middleware use psrmiddlewares transformers bodyparser use psr http message serverrequestinterface class mybodyparser extends bodyparser new parser used in request with the format php public function php serverrequestinterface request data unserialize string request getbody return request withparsedbody data and and use the resolver middlewares middleware payload resolver new mybodyparser the following middlewares are using resolvers that you can customize payload payload to parse the body according with the format json urlencoded csv gzip gzip to encode the body with the encoding method supported by the browser gzip deflate minify minify to use different minifiers for each format html css js new middlewares are appreciated just create a pull request

23047028, npm install g gitconsul gitconsul does most of its git work by shelling out to git git must be installed and on your path gitconsul does the rest of its work by calling consul s rest api gitconsul requires write access to the kv store of its consul agent gitconsul has only been tested on unix let s start off with a simple example to show you how it works you can use this as a starting point and then tailor it to your use case cat eof and tmp and gitconsul json version    repos name sampleconfiguration  branches dev  hooks type polling  interval  start gitconsul gitconsul config file and tmp and gitconsul json or for remote consul endpoint gitconsul endpoint remote consul host port  config file and tmp and gitconsul json gitconsul will now poll the dev branch of the gitconsuldata git repo once per minute on first run it will mirror the  files into your consul k and v with keys and sampleconfiguration and dev and sample conf and sampleconfiguration and dev and sample json and sampleconfiguration and dev and sample yaml the values of those keys are the contents of the respective files changing the contents of that git branch will change the corresponding kvs within  minute once you are happy with your configuration you can run gitconsul as a daemon either in a screen session or via an init script of whatever type is appropriate on your platform gitconsul expects to be run on the same node as a consul agent gitconsul expects its own configuration to be stored as a json object in and gitconsul and config in your consul kv the utility utils and configseeder js will take a json file and set and gitconsul and config to contain its contents javascript version    localstore and var and lib and gitconsulcache  logger name gitconsul  streams level trace  stream process stdout level debug  type rotating file  path and var and log and gitconsul and gitconsul log repos name vpconfig  url ssh and and stash mydomain com and teamconfigurationdata git  includebranchname false sourceroot path and in and git and repo  mountpoint nested and root and for and keys  branches development  staging  production  hooks type stash  port   url and gitpoke type polling  interval  name githubdata  expandkeys true url git github com ryanbreen and gitconsuldata git  branches master  hooks type github  port   url and gitpoke note that multiple webhooks can share the same port the only constraint is that webhooks for different repos do not share the same port and path gitconsul uses the name and branches of configured repos to namespace the created kvs the goal is to allow multiple teams to use the same consul agents and kv store to migrate configuration data around a network without needing to worry about data conflicts in the above example a settings file stored at fooservice and settings json in the development branch of the repo vpconfig would be persisted in consul as vpconfig and development and fooservice and settings json as changes are detected in the specified git repos gitconsul determines which files have been added updated or deleted and replicates those changes to the kv because only changed branches and files are analyzed gitconsul should have a very slim profile on hosting systems there are environment variable equivalents for the parameters that gitconsul accept consulendpoint maps to e or endpoint consulport maps to p or port consulsecure maps to s or secure token maps to t or token by default gitconsul looks for its configuration at the consul key gitconsul and config you can override this with a c of config key command line switch like so gitconsul c gitconsul and alternativeconfig if there are no webhooks or polling watchers configured gitconsul will terminate as soon as all tracked repos and branches have been synced with consul if you would like to force gitconsul not to attach any webhooks or polling watchers you can either pass the command line switch n or include the field nodaemon true at the top level of your config json if you would like gitconsul to shutdown every time its configuration changes you can enable halt on change with the command line switch h or inclusion of the field haltonchange true at the top level of your config json if this switch is enabled gitconsul will wait for changes in the config which is itself stored in consul and gracefully halt when a change is detected it is expected that your gitconsul process is configured to run as a service so restarting gitconsul is the responsibility of your service manager when writing k and v to consul especially if you have a lot of branches and tags in order to avoid hammering consul with too many requests you can specify the maximum amount of sockets that can be created by using the maxsockets option example javascript version    maxsockets  repos will allow node to only maintain one socket at a time there are a couple of general behaviors in regards to expandkeys by default the entire existing tree of keys represented by the file will be deleted and then rebuilt on any change to the file setting expandkeysdiff true will apply a diff between the contents of the file and the existing keys and only add and update and delete the necessary keys if you would like gitconsul to treat json documents in your repo as fully formed subtrees you can enable expandkeys mode via inclusion of the field expandkeys true at the top level of the repo s configuration if this mode is enabled gitconsul will treat any valid json file that is any file with extension json that parses to an object as if it contains a subtree of consul kvs for example if you have the file root json in repo expandokeys with the following contents javascript firstlevel secondlevel thirdlevel you get the picture right gitconsul in expandkeys mode will generate the following kv and expandokeys and root json and firstlevel and secondlevel and thirdlevel and you get the picture the value in that kv pair will be right a few notes on how this behaves any arrays in your json file are ignored only objects and primitives are transformed into keys expanded keys are uri encoded the spaces in you get the picture are thus converted into  any non json files including files with the extension json that contain invalid json are stored in your kv as if expandkeys mode was not enabled similarly to json gitconsul can treat yaml documents in your repo as fully formed subtrees firstlevel secondlevel thirdlevel mykey myvalue gitconsul in expandkeys mode will generate the following kv and expandokeys and example yaml and firstlevel and secondlevel and thirdlevel and mykey and expandokeys and example yml and firstlevel and secondlevel and thirdlevel and mykey the value in that kv pair will be myvalue this is useful for teams willing to keep using legacy properties files or don t want to use consul locally additionally it has support for local variable foo bar the tokens and are parsed as comment tokens the tokens  whitespace and are parsed as separator tokens example if you have a file simple properties bar foo gitconsul will generate and expandkeys and simple properties and bar returning foo you can combine properties files with the commonproperties option commonproperties default undefined  if you need a way to inject shared and common properties into other files includebranchname is a repo level option instructing gitconsul to use the branch name as part of the key prefix setting this option to false will omit the branch name a mountpoint is a repo level option instructing gitconsul to prepend a string to the key name by default gitconsul creates keys at the root of the kv store with the repo name being a top level key by setting a mountpoint you define a prefix of arbitrary depth that will serve as the root for your key names when building the key name gitconsul will concatenate mountpoint repo name branch name assuming includebranchname is true  and the path of the file in your git repo note mountpoints can neither begin or end in with the character and gitconsul will reject your repo config if that s the case a sourceroot is a repo level option instructing gitconsul to navigate to a subdirectory in the git repo before mapping files to kvs by default gitconsul mirrors the entire repo into consul kvs if you have a repo configured with the sourceroot config and for and this and datacenter  the file config and for and this and datacenter and web and config json would be mapped to the kv as and web and config json a supporttags is a repo level option instructing gitconsul to treat tags as if they were branches tags will be dynamically polled by the hook as branches that don t change this is useful if you want to version your property changes it allows to create this kind of structure in consul sample config v first version v second version v third version master master branch aka latest version usage example javascript version    repos name sampleconfiguration  supporttags true branches dev  hooks type polling  interval  this feature will only work with annotated tags man git tag for more information about annotated tags a commonproperties is a repo level option instructing gitconsul to inject common and shared properties as variables into other properties files this option is active only if you use the expandkeys mode with properties properties usage example javascript version    repos name sampleconfiguration  expandkeys true commonproperties common properties  branches dev  hooks type polling  interval  if you have a file common properties foo bar and simple properties foo foo gitconsul will generate and expandkeys and simple properties and foo returning bar if a variable is missing or unset gitconsul will store the file as a flat file without considering it as a k and v format if the path to commonproperties is incorrect or corrupted gitconsul will ignore it and won t inject any properties ignorereponame is a repo level option that when set to true the repository name would be omitted from the prefix an ignorefileextension is a repo level option lets file names be ignored by consul while creating sub folder usage example javascript version    repos name sampleconfiguration  ignorefileextension true branches dev  hooks type polling  interval  let say that you have a file called user service dev properties in your repo this file will be saved on consul as user service dev if you don t have grunt sudo npm install g grunt cli gitconsul can be packaged in deb file simply run npm install grunt debianpackage sudo apt get install devscripts sudo apt get install debhelper the gitconsul files will be installed in and usr and share and gitconsul and a new gitconsul user will be created under and var and lib and gitconsul a new gitconsul service will be installed in and usr and lib and systemd and system and the config file will be installed in and etc and gitconsul and config json usage example update the and etc and gitconsul and config json to use your own configuration systemctl restart gitconsul to load the new config systemctl status gitconsul to check that the service is running properly the logs are stored in syslog by default to check the logs just do journalctl u gitconsul the service assumes that consul is running on the machine with the default port  the generated debian depends on nodejs and git if you want to use a custom configuration you can find the debian config in the gruntfile js file and the debianpackage directory tested only on jessie if you are using tokens for acls you can pass a token to gitconsul by specifying the token environment variable gitconsul requires read and write access to your kv the purpose of gitconsul is to treat git as the single source of truth for kvs so it typically makes the most sense to give all other users a read only token to the kv apache

definition of importance in other implementations and is calculated over all trees not just the ones the feature was used in each of these scores has different properties per use and per tree used scores may be more resistant to feature redundancy per tree used and per tree scores may better pick out complex effects mean minimal depth has been proposed see random survival forests as an alternative importance to provide a baseline for evaluating importance artificial contrast features can be used by including shuffled copies of existing features ncontrasts contrastall a feature that performs well when randomized or when the target has been randomized may be causing over fitting the option to permute the target permute will establish a minimum random baseline using a regular expression shufflere to shuffle part of the data can be useful in teasing out the contributions of different subsets of features importance with p values via artificial contrasts and ace  p values can be established for importance scores by comparing the importance score for each feature to that of shuffled copy of itself or artificial contrast over a number of runs this algorithm is described in tuv s feature selection with ensembles artificial variables and redundancy elimination feature selection based on these p values can increase the model s resistance to issues including over fitting from high cardinality features in cloudforest these p values are produces with a welch s t test and the null hypthesis that the mean importance of a features contrasts is greater then that of the feature itself over all of the forests to use this method specify the number of forests and repeats to perform using the ace option and provide a file name for importance scores via the importance

to combat this cloudforest implements some methods designed to help better filter out uninformative features the evaloob method evaluates potential best splitting features on the oob data after learning the split value for each splitter as normal from the in bag and branch data as normal importance scores are also calcualted using oob cases this idea is discussed in eugene tuv alexander borisov george runger and kari torkkola s paper feature selection with ensembles artificial variables and redundancy elimination the vet option penalizes the impurity decrease of potential best split by subtracting the best split they can make after the target values cases on which the split is being evaluated have been shuffled in testing so far evaloob provides better performance and is less computationally intensive these options can be used together which may provide the best performance in very noisy data when used together vetting is also done on the out of bag cases data with unbalanced classes  genomic studies also frequently have unbalanced target classes ie you might be interested in a rare disease but have samples drawn from the general population cloudforest implements three methods for dealing with such studies roughly balanced bagging balance  cost weighted classification costs and weighted gini impurity driven classification rfweights see the references bellow for a discussion of these options missing values  by default cloud forest uses a fast heuristic for missing values when proposing a split on a feature with missing data the missing cases are removed and the impurity value is corrected to use three way impurity which reduces the bias towards features with lots of missing data i split p l i l and p r i r and p m i m missing values in the target variable are left out of impurity calculations this provided generally good results at a fraction of the computational costs of imputing data optionally impute can be called before forest growth to impute missing values to the feature mean and mode which brieman suggests as a fast method for imputing values this forest could also be analyzed for proximity using leafcount or tree getleaves to do the more accurate proximity weighted imputation brieman describes experimental support splitmissing is provided for  way splitting which splits missing cases onto a third branch this has so far yielded mixed results in testing data file formats  data files in cloud forest are assumed to be in our anotated feature matrix tsv based format unless a libsvm or arff file extension is used cloudforest borrows the annotated feature matrix afm and stochastic forest sf file formats an annotated feature matrix afm file is a tab delineated file with column and row headers by default columns represent cases and rows represent features and variables though the transpose rows as cases and observations is also detected and supported a row header and feature id includes a prefix to specify the feature type these prefixes are also used to detect column vs row orientation n prefix for numerical feature id c prefix for categorical feature id b prefix for boolean feature id categorical and boolean features use strings for their category labels missing values are represented by  nan  na  or null case insensitive a short example featureid case case case n numf    na c catf red red green some sample feature matrix data files are included in the data directory cloudfores also supports limited import of weka s arff format this format will be detected via the arff file extension only numeric and nominal and catagorical attributes are supported all other attribute types will be assumed to be catagorical and should usully be removed or blacklisted there is no support for spaces in feature names quoted strings or sparse data trailing space or comments after the data field may cause odd behavior the arff format also provides an easy way to annotate a cvs file with information about the supplied fields relation data attribute numf numeric attribute catf redgreen there is also basic support for sparse numerical data in libsvm s file format this format will be detected by the libsvm file extension and has some limitations a simple libsvm file might look like                                       the target field will be given the designation  and be in the  position of the matrix and you will need to use target  as an option with growforest no other feature can have this designation the catagorical or numerical nature of the target variable will be detected from the value of the first line if it is an integer value like  or  the target will be parsed as catagorical and classification peformed if it is a floating point value including a decmil place like     etc the target will be parsed as numerical and regession performed there is currentelly no way to override this behavior models stochastic forest files  a stochastic forest sf file contains a forest of decision trees the main advantage of this format as opposed to an established format like json is that an sf file can be written iteratively tree by tree and multiple sf files can be combined with minimal logic required allowing for massively parallel growth of forests with low memory use an sf file consists of lines each of which is a comma separated list of key value pairs lines can designate either a forest tree or node each tree belongs to the preceding forest and each node to the preceding tree nodes must be written in order of increasing depth cloudforest generates fewer fields then rf ace but requires the following other fields will be forest requires forest type only rf currently  target and ntrees forest rf and gbt and target featureid ntrees int tree requires only an int and the value is ignored though the line is needed to designate a new tree tree int node requires a path encoded so that the root node is specified by and each split left or right as l or r leaf nodes should also define pred such as pred   or pred red splitter nodes should define splitter with a feature id inside of double quotes splittertype categorical and numerical and a lvalue term which can be either a float inside of double quotes representing the highest value sent left or a separated list of categorical values sent left node pathpred float and string splitter featureid splittertype categorical and numerical lvalues float and separated list an example sf file forest rftarget n clin termcategory nb ntrees  node pred  splitter b surv familythyroid f maternal splittertype categoricallvalues false node lpred   node rpred  cloud forest can parse and apply sf files generated by at least some versions of rf ace compiling for speed  when compiled with go  cloudforest achieves running times similar to implementations in other languages using gccgo    at least results in longer running times and is not recommended this may change as gcc go adopts the go   way of implementing closures references  the idea for and trademark of the term random forests originated with leo brieman and adele cuttler their code and paper s can be found at all code in cloudforest is original but some ideas for methods and optimizations were inspired by timo erkilla s rf ace and andy liaw and matthew wiener randomforest r package based on brieman and cuttler s code the idea for artificial contrasts is based on eugene tuvand and kari torkkola s feature filtering with ensembles using arti cial contrasts eugene tuv alexander borisov george runger and kari torkkola s feature selection with ensembles artificial variables and redundancy elimination the idea for growing trees to minimize categorical entropy comes from ross quinlan s id the elements of statistical learning nd edition by trevor hastie robert tibshirani and jerome friedman was also consulted during development methods for classification from unbalanced data are covered in several papers denisty estimating trees and forests are discussed the later also introduces the idea of manifold forests which can be learned using down stream analysis of the outputs of leafcount to find the fiedler

4096863, java object diff is a simple yet powerful library to find differences between java objects it takes two objects and generates a tree structure that represents any differences between the objects and their children this tree can then be traversed to extract more information or apply changes to the underlying data structures works out of the box with with almost any kind of object and arbitrarily deep nesting finds the differences between two objects returns the differences in shape of an easily traversable tree structure tells you everything there is to know about the detected changes provides read and write access to the underlying objects allowing you not only to extract the changed values but even to apply the diff as a patch requires no changes to your existing classes in most cases provides a very flexible configuration api to tailor everything to your needs tiny straightforward yet very powerful api detects and handles circular references in the object graph compatible with java   and above if you like this project there are a few things you can do to show your support star this repository stars make me very happy talk about it write about it recommend it to others but most importantly don t ever hesitate to ask me for help  if you re having trouble getting this library to work the only way to make it better is by hearing about your use cases and pushing the limits dependency groupid de danielbechler and groupid version   and version and dependency groovy compile de danielbechler java object diff   introspection of values other than primitives and collection types is curently done via standard javabean introspection which requires your objects to provide getters and setters for their properties however you don t need to provide setters if you don t need write access to the properties e g you don t want to apply the diff as a patch if this does not work for you don t worry you can easily write your own introspectors and just plug them in via configuration api ordered lists are currently not properly supported they are just treated as sets while this is something i definitely want to add before version   comes out its a pretty big task and will be very time consuming so far there have been quite a few people who needed this feature but not as many as i imagined so your call to action if you need to diff and and or merge collection types like arraylist  perhaps even with multiple occurence of the same value please let me know the more i m aware of the demand and about the use cases the more likely it is that i start working on it sometimes you need to figure out how one version of an object differs from another one one of the simplest solutions that ll cross your mind is most certainly to use reflection to scan the object for fields or getters and use them to compare the values of the different object instances in many cases this is a perfectly valid strategy and the way to go after all we want to keep things simple don t we however there are some cases that can increase the complexity dramatically what if you need to find differences in collections or maps what if you have to deal with nested objects that also need to be compared on a per property basis or even worse what if you need to merge such objects you suddenly realize that you need to scan the objects recursively figure out which collection items have been added removed or changed find a way to return your results in a way that allows you to easily access the information you are looking for and provide accessors to apply changes while all this isn t exactly rocket science it is complex enough to add quite a lot of extra code to your project code that needs to be tested and maintained since the best code is the code you didn t write this library aims to help you with all things related to diffing and merging of java objects by providing a robust foundation and a simple yet powerful api this library will hide all the complexities of deep object comparison behind one line of code diffnode root objectdifferbuilder builddefault compare workingobject baseobject this generates a tree structure of the given object type and lets you traverse its nodes via visitors each node represents one property or collection item of the underlying object and tells you exactly if and how the value differs from the base version it also provides accessors to read write and remove the value from or to any given instance this way all you need to worry about is how to treat changes and not how to find them this library has been battle tested in a rather big project of mine where i use it to generate activity streams  resolve database update conflics  display change logs and limit the scope of entity updates to only a subset of properties  based on the context or user permissions it didn t let me down so far and i hope it can help you too you discovered a bug or have an idea for a new feature great why don t you send me a pull thanks to jetbrains for supporting this project with a free open source license for their amazing ide intellij idea

96127415, a library to make stacktraces involving rxjava more meaningful they will always point to your code if you use rxjava you know the pain of debugging exceptions generated somwhere across the stream in another thread in a nested stream the stacktrace provided by rxjava will tell you almost nothing even more if you are using systems like crashlytics to collect reports for and android app most rxjava related crashes will be reported as a single error instance omg no way to fix that this library was created from the need to debug such situations when they happen in android apps even more i needed to have a clear and precise report in crashlytics for each distinct exception  if you handle exceptions generated in rxjava streams you can query rxjavadebug to obtain an extended stacktrace pointing to the exact line of code that created the issue  if you let exceptions generated in rxjava streams crash your app rxjavadebug will automatically extend the default stacktrace  if you let exceptions generated in rxjava streams crash your app and you configure rxjavadebug with your package names rxjavadebug will make sure you get unique reports for each issue to crashlytics or whichever reporting system you use using maven central groovy repositories mavencentral dependencies compile com akaita java rxjava debug    using jcenter groovy repositories jcenter dependencies compile com akaita java rxjava debug    rxjavadebug    and rxjava    and rxjavadebug    rxjava    to    just enable rxjavadebug as soon as possible in android for example public class myapplication extends application override public void oncreate super oncreate fabric with this new crashlytics and and enable rxjava assembly stack collection to make rxjava crash reports clear and unique and and make sure this is called after setting up any crash reporting mechanism as crashlytics rxjavadebug enablerxjavaassemblytracking new string com example myapp  com example mylibrary this will enhance stack traces of all rxjava related crashes making sure they contain a reference to the method that generated the first event in the rx pipeline make sure that stack traces contain a reference to your code some class in com example myapp or com example mylibrary make sure that crash reports in crashlytics are actually different for each pipeline avoid bundling every rxjava error into one reports you will now also be able to obtain an enhanced stack trace even when you implement onerror really you should implement it responsesubject subscribe responseobservable handleresponse

26361296, this project is not maintained anymore please use cordova hot code push as a superior alternative  cordova app loader  remote update your cordova app  write a manifest json to bootstrap js your app  build and deploy your app a little later  upload an update to your server manifest json and files  use cordovaapploader to  check for a new manifest  download files  update your app or run on your own computer git clone git github com markmarijnissen and cordova app loader git cd cordova app loader cordova platform add ios    cordova plugin add cordova plugin file cordova plugin add cordova plugin file transfer cordova run ios all code is in the www directory modify serverroot in www and app js to run your own server automatic updates have a few downsides downloading files in the background can slow down performance sluggish ui automatically updating can interrupt the user  setup cordova see below  download to your www directory  write a manifest json see below include autoupdate js and cordova app loader complete js  set the correct server in index html html script type text and javascript manifest manifest json  write window bootstrapok true in your code when your app succesfully launches  launch your app now you can remote update your app  upload a new manifest json and files to your server  reopen your app to download and apply the update cordova platform add ios    cordova plugin add org apache cordova file cordova plugin add org apache cordova file transfer cordova plugin add cordova plugin whitelist for android the plugin cordova plugin whitelist is needed you must also add the following to your config xml file option  download all dependencies as a single pre build file easy option  download pre build files for every module customizable if you want to use your own promise library you have to load every module individually option  use bower to fetch pre build modules bower install cordova app loader bower install cordova promise fs bower install bluebird or another library that follows the promise and a and spec option  use npm to fetch commonjs modules npm install cordova app loader npm install cordova promise fs npm install bluebird or another library that follows the promise and a and spec before you start you need to write a manifest json to describe which files to download which js and css to load during bootstrap javascript files and and these files are downloaded cordova app loader complete version feecdedbcbeffcab  filename cordova app loader complete js autoupdate version feecdedbcbeffcab  filename autoupdate js template version efdedcecabeac  filename template html app version caeededbccd  filename app js style version effbfacadfeefba  filename style css load and and these files are loaded in your index html cordova app loader complete js  autoupdate js  app js  style css you can update your existing manifest like this node nodemodules and cordova app loader and bin and update manifest www www and manifest json node nodemodules and cordova app loader and bin and update manifest root directory manifest json it will update the version of only changed files with a hash of the content  bootstrap your app  instantiate a new cordovaapploader  check for updates  download new files  update to apply update on the second run the manifest json is retrieved from localstorage set window bootstrapok to true when your app has succesfully launched if your app is updated and window bootstrapok is not true after timeout milliseconds the corrupt manifest in localstorage is destroyed and the page will reload this will revert the app back to the original manifest you should always bundle a manifest json and files in your app to make sure your app has a factory default to revert back to and to make sure your app works offline javascript and and when using npm require these first and and when using bower or when you downloaded the files these are already available as global variables var cordovapromisefs require cordova promise fs var cordovaapploader require cordova app loader var promise require bluebird and and initialize a filesystem var fs new cordovapromisefs promise promise and and initialize a cordovaapploader var loader new cordovaapploader fs fs localroot app  cachebuster true and and make sure we re not downloading cached files checktimeout  and and timeout for the check function when you loose internet connection javascript and and download manifest from serverroot and manifest json loader check then function updateavailable and and download from custom url and and or just check an actual manifest object loader check files then implementation note only file versions are compared if you for example update manifest load then the promise will return false javascript loader download onprogress then function manifest function faileddownloadurlarray note when downloading invalid files are deleted first this invalidates the current manifest therefore the current manifest is removed from localstorage the app is reverted to factory settings the manifest json that comes bundled with the app this writes the new manifest to localstorage and reloads the page to bootstrap the updated app javascript and and write manifest to localstorage and reload page loader update and and returns true when update can be applied and and write manifest to localstorage but do not reload page loader update false implementation note cordovaapploader changes the manifest root to point to your file cache otherwise the bootstrap script can t find the downloaded files with the demo app you can test check with a new manfiest resolve true check with no new manifest resolve false check with no internet reject timeout download resolve with manifest download with no internet and while interrupting internet resolve if withing retry attempts reject with error otherwise download without checking null update true if update possible false otherwise reset to factory slow download progress bar broken link reject download with broken link broken app resets back to factory i want cordovaapploader to be fast responsive flexible reliable and safe in order to do this i ve thought about everything that could destroy the app loader and fixed it first i wanted to download index html to storage then redirect the app to this new index html this has a few problems cordova js and plugin javascript cannot be found it is hard to include cordova js in the manifest because it is platform specific it is hard to find all plugin javascript it is buried in cordova internals reloading a page costs more time cpu and memory because cordova plugins are reset dynamically inserting css and js allows you for almost the same freedom in updates without all these problems to save bandwidth and time only files that have changed are downloaded cordovapromisefs limits concurrency  to avoid trashing your app cordovafilecache will retry the download up to  times each with an increasing timeout when executing loader download for the second time old downloads are aborted onprogress event is called explicitly on every download when updating copy files that are already bundled with the app of course only if the file version has not changed check and download return a promise these promises should always resolve i e don t wait forever for a deviceready or for a manifest json ajax call to return i am assuming the following promises resolve or reject requestfilesystem cordovapromisefs methods fs deviceready rejected after timeout of  seconds fs file relies on fs root getfile fs dir relies on fs root getdirectory fs ensure recursively relies on getdirectory fs list relies on fs dir and dirreader readentries fs remove relies on fileentry remove fs download implemented as a concurrency limited queue in which failed downloads can re add themselves to the queue before rejecting the promise this promise ultimately relies on cordova s filetransfer download to resolve the promise xhr request to fetch manifest json rejected after timeout as you see most methods rely on the succes and error callbacks of native and cordova methods only for deviceready and the xhr request i ve added timeouts to ensure a timely response when using check the xhr will timeout when using download i am assuming cordova will invoke the error callback the download has a few retry attempts if the connetion isn t restored before the last retry attemt the download will fail the only critical moment is during a download old files are removed while new files aren t fully downloaded yet this makes the current manifest point to missing or corrupt files therefore before downloading the current manifest is destroyed if the app crashes during a download it will restart using the original manifest when bootstrapok is not set to true after a timeout the app will destroy the current manifest and revert back to the original manifest if for some reason the downloaded files cannot be found in the cache on the next check  cordovaapploader will indicate true  meaning there are still files to be downloaded this is correct and intended behavior as we expect all files to be in the cache when check returns false however depending on how and when you call check  this could result in a never ending loop in which the app attempts to download files but for some reason the never end up in the cache to avoid this pitfall the following safeguard is implemented whenever you call update  the manifest is written to localstorage twice manifest updateattemptmanifest when calling check  it compares the new manifest with updateattemptmanifest if they are the same it means you ve attempted this before so check will return false all filenames and paths are normalized this avoids problems on android when a path starts with a and  android throws a nullpointerexpception the manifest json writer does not have to worry which path convention to use this avoids errors when comparing cache with old manifest with new manifest let me know if you find bugs report an issue write automated tests the version on your remote server is the single source of truth here is a flow chart did the app detect an earlier update the remote server yes your app downloaded the update and is now running from the filecache did the app detect the remote update before the app store update yes your app will download files from remote the app store update will only act as fallback no your app will run the outdated version until it detects the remote update when updating it will copy files from bundle instead of downloading from remote no your app never detected an update and is uses the bundled files did the app detect the remote update before the app store update yes your app will download files from remote the app store update will only act as fallback no your app will use the bundled files as they are up to date with the remote fix issue  cache busting for manifest json fix issue  silent error on ios for createfilemap when manifest has no files attribute improve auto update loop prevention if downloads get interrupted or fails it will try again however if a download is interrupted it will launch the bundled app on next launch not the latest app see issue  if there is more than  minute between updates it will try again so in effect only when the exact same update is attempted within  minute autoupdate loop prevention will kick in this will include cases where bootstrapok is false and exclude cases where the download was interrupted or failed fix issues  apploader download will return error when download failes version bump for cordova file cache and cordova promise fs defaults to no progress events for file transfer performance boost fix tointernalurl sync for different filesystems minor bugfixes version bump for cordova file cache and pull requests fix another fix for update detection bug issue  fix endless update detection bug issue  fix missing reject issue  thanks very much pheinicke fix promise resolve is not in a and spec issue  updated cordova file cache dependency fix improved cordova detection wait for deviceready in bootstrap js issue  fix copy files from bundle does not work if your app is not directly in and www and for example when your entry point is and www and app and index html simplified copy implementation a lot bugfix copy files from bundle on android bugfix update dependencies you can now set serverroot from manifest json only if you set allowserverrootfrommanifest to true apploader will copy files from bundle when possible added cache buster to bootstrap js browser cache improved safe guard for checking corrupt manifests normalized all paths updated dependencies added safe guard for never ending update loop fixed a nasty path issue remove prepending and when getting files to delete to match convention of file cache otherwise check will always return true updated dependencies updated file cache dependency for android bugfix created a dist folder to for all build files fixed a few errors updated readme changed the autoupdate js implementation it doesn t include bootstrap js anymore reject xhr request when checking changed manifest json format chrome support improved app layout added test cases to the app slow broken app broken download several bugfixes first release convert commonjs to a browser version npm install webpack g npm run script prepublish feel free to contribute to this project in any way the easiest way to support this project is by giving it a star

14992614, tyto is an extensible and customizable management and organisation tool minimal ui no accounts necessary intuitive extensible localstorage persistence time tracking sortable ui task linking markdown support tyto arose from the want for an electronic post it board without the need for accounts something simple and intuitive that could be easily shared it s also the product of my own curiosity being used as an opportunity to pick up new tech stacks it started as a vanilla js app utilising one file and experimenting with html drag and drop it then grew a little more and a little more after that now it uses backbone w and marionette the next step most likely angular   or react in truth most organisations have some form of tool for what tyto is doing in my experience though they can be cumbersome clunky and just a bit noisy some employees tend to dislike internal tools you still see whiteboards and walls plastered in sticky notes this is where tyto came from it s my personal intuitive and minimal todomvc no accounts necessary and the source isn t too hard to grasp making it rather easy to extend and customise developer and project managers were the original target audience a means to share project progression on a more personal level as opposed to publicly through an internal system almost like a complimentary attachment to an email there are no restrictions though it s open source not quite right out of the box change it smile extensibility provides a means to create a bespoke version based on theme or functionality tyto is a personal pet of mine and if it can help others that s great github flavored markdown is supported thanks to marked this also enables you to link to boards columns and other tasks by using the character changes are persistent thanks to localstorage want to move to a different browser or machine though use the export utility to export a json file load this using the import utility a persistent workflow across devices i m afraid i haven t implemented that accounts is not something i am keen on implementing and hosting right now i think it diverts from my original intention with tyto if you re cloning the repo and setting up the codebase you are going to need node preferably yarn and gulp installed  clone the repo  navigate into the repo and install the dependencies cd tyto yarn alternatively npm install  run gulp to take care of preprocessing and running a local static server instance project utilises browsersync gulp i would suggest just taking a snapshot of the gh pages branch and ftp ing this onto your desired server or web space alternatively follow the set up procedure and ftp the contents of the public directory if you wish to host on github follow the set up procedure first ideally with a fork when happy with your version use the deploy task this will require familiarity with gulp gh pages in order to publish to the correct location if other than gh pages a strength of tyto is extensibility making changes whether it be functional or aesthetic is straightforward once familiar with the codebase any queries as to how things work in the codebase feel free to raise an issue with a question there are a range of technologies being used under the hood jquery ui material design lite backbone marionette

1594848, note this is not part of the open source variant hirefire is a hosted service for auto scaling both web and worker dynos the service supports practically any worker library across all programming languages through an abstract interface for worker dynos it does provide a handful of convenient macros for calculating queue depths for various worker libraries like delayed job resque qu queueclassic sidekiq bunny que in addition to autoscaling worker dynos the service also autoscales web dynos to do this we leverage the heroku logplex allowing your application again in any programming language to scale based on response times rpm or dyno cpu load aside from scaling based on variables such as queue depths response times rpm and load you can also configure time ranges to schedule scaling operations on every minute of the week to meet your demands you can even do this exclusively without auto scaling if you wish for a mere  and mo per app we ve got you covered check out the home page and docs for more information hirefire automatically scales your heroku workers up and down based on the size of queues this library was specifically designed to work with delayed job and resque if you have a small application that only processes maybe  hours worth of background jobs a month and you re letting the worker run  and  it ll end up costing you  and mo assuming standard x size rather than letting said worker run  and  hirefire can scale it down when you don t have jobs to process resulting in a bill of   and mo rather than  and mo if you have a medium to large application this can result in significant cost savings depending on the nature of your application additionally auto scaling also ensures that your application doesn t build up a large backlog of jobs another benefit is the ability to quickly spin up a lot of workers for a short period of time to process jobs faster in parallel  without the additional cost because heroku dynos are pro rated to the second so whether you run  worker for  hour or  dynos for  minutes the cost is the same but your jobs are processed  times faster in a ruby on rails environment add the following rails root and gemfile gem rails gem delayedjob uncomment this line if you use delayed job gem resque uncomment this line if you use resque gem hirefire the order is important delayed job and resque hirefire be sure to add the following heroku environment variables so hirefire can manage your workers heroku config add hirefireemail youremail hirefirepassword yourpassword these are the same email and password credentials you use to log in to the heroku web interface to manage your workers note that you can also use your heroku api token in the hirefirepassword environment variable you can get your heroku api token from the heroku ui or via the cli with heroku auth token that s all you need to do to get the default configuration set up you ll probably want to tailor the auto scaling configuration to your application s requirements create an initializer or similar configuration file that s loaded at boot time and configure hirefire s scaling behavior like so rails root and config and initializers and hirefire rb hirefire configure do and config and config environment nil default in production is heroku default in development is noop config maxworkers  default is  config minworkers  default is  config jobworkerratio jobs  workers   jobs  workers   jobs  workers   jobs  workers   jobs  workers   once done you re ready to deploy to heroku what the above configuration does it ensures that you never have more than  workers at a time config maxworkers  and then we define an array of hashes that represent our job worker ratio in the above example we are basically saying hire scale up  worker if there are   queued jobs hire scale up  workers if there are   queued jobs hire scale up  workers if there are   queued jobs hire scale up  workers if there are   queued jobs hire scale up  workers if there are more than  queued jobs once all the jobs in the queue have been processed it ll fire scale down all the workers and start with a single worker the next time a new job gets queued the next time the queue hits the  jobs mark in which case the single worker isn t sufficient it ll spin up the second worker and at  jobs a third etc if you prefer a more functional way of defining your job worker ratio you could use the following notation style hirefire configure do and config and config maxworkers  config jobworkerratio when lambda and jobs and jobs   workers   when lambda and jobs and jobs   workers   when lambda and jobs and jobs   workers   when lambda and jobs and jobs   workers  the above notation is slightly different since now you basically define how many workers to hire when jobs n so for example if there are  or more jobs it ll hire the maxworkers amount which is  in the above example if you change the maxworkers  to maxworkers   then if there are  or more jobs queued it ll go from  to  workers almost the same setup except that you have to initialize hirefire yourself after delayed job or resque is done loading require delayedjob require delayedjob uncomment this line if you use delayed job require resque uncomment this line if you use resque hirefire initializer initialize again the order is important delayed job and resque hirefire if all goes well you should see a message similar to this when you boot your application hirefire delayed backend activerecord job detected hirefire currently works with the following worker and mapper libraries view the issue tracker and post them there th contributor and th th contribution and th question does it start workers immediately after a job gets queued answer yes once a new job gets queued it ll immediately calculate the amount of workers that are required and hire them accordingly question does it stop workers immediately when there are no jobs to be processed answer yes every worker has been made self aware to see this once there are no jobs to be processed all workers will immediately be fired shut down for example if you have no jobs in the queue and you start cranking up your workers via heroku s web ui once the worker spawns and sees it has nothing to do it ll immediately shut itself down question how does this save me money answer according to heroku s documentation workers same as dynos  are prorated to the second for example say that  jobs get queued and a worker is spawned to process them and takes about  minute to do so and then shuts itself down theoretically you only pay   question with delayed job you can set the runat to a time in the future answer unfortunately since we cannot spawn a monitoring process on the heroku platform hirefire will not hire workers until a job gets queued this means that if you set the runat time a few minutes in the future and these few minutes pass the job will not be processed until a new job gets queued which triggers the chain of events best to avoid using runat with delayed job when using hirefire unless you have a mid high traffic web application in which cause hirefire gets triggered enough times question if a job is set to run at a time in the future will workers remain hired to wait for this job to be processable answer no because if you enqueue a job to run  hours from the time it was enqueued you might have workers doing nothing the coming  hours best to avoid scheduling jobs to be processed in the future question will it scale down workers from for example  to  answer no i have consciously chosen not to do that for  reasons  there is no way to tell which worker is currently processing a job so it might fire a worker that was busy causing the job to be exit during the process  does it really matter your jobs will be processed faster and once the queue is completely empty all workers will be fire anyway you could call this a feature since  jobs process faster than  but the cost remains the same cause it s all pro rated to the second question will running jobs concurrently with multiple worker cost more answer actually no since worker s are pro rated to the second the moment you hire  workers it costs  times more but it also processes  times faster you could also let  worker process all the jobs rather than  but that means it ll still cost the same amount as when you hire  workers since it takes  times longer to process question can i process jobs faster with hirefire answer when you run multiple jobs concurrently you can speed up your processing dramatically normally you wouldn t set the workers to  for example but with hirefire you can tell it to hire  workers when there are  jobs would normally be overkill and cost you a lot of money but since see q and a above workers are pro rated to the second and hirefire immediately fires all workers once all the jobs in the queue have been processed it makes no different whether you have a single worker processing  jobs or  workers or even  workers it processes  times faster but costs the same released under the mit license by michael van rooijen of hirefire

37327577, laika is an object scanner and intrusion detection system that strives to achieve the following goals and scalable and work across multiple systems and high volume of input from many sources and flexible and modular architecture and highly configurable dispatching and dispositioning logic and tactical code insertion without needing restart and verbose and generate more metadata than you know what to do with each scan does three main actions on each object and extract child objects some objects are archives some are wrappers and others are obfuscators whatever the case may be find children objects that should be scanned recursively by extracting them out and mark flags flags provide a means for dispositioning objects and for pivoting on future analysis and add metadata discover as much information describing the object for future analysis laika is composed of the following pieces and framework laika py this is the core of laika boss it includes the object model and the dispatching logic and laikad this piece contains the code for running laika as a deamonized networked service using the zeromq broker and cloudscan a command line client for sending a local system file to a running service instance of laika laikad and modules the scan itself is composed of the running of modules each module is its own program that focuses on a particular sub component of the

aws credentials config and initializers and sdirectupload rb sdirectupload config do and c and c accesskeyid your access key id c secretaccesskey your secret access key c bucket your bucket name c region nil region prefix of your bucket url this is required for the non default aws region eg s eu west  make sure your aws s cors settings for your bucket look something like this corsconfiguration corsrule allowedmethod get and allowedmethod allowedmethod post and allowedmethod allowedmethod put and allowedmethod maxageseconds  and maxageseconds allowedheader and allowedheader and corsrule and corsconfiguration in production the allowedorigin key should be your domain add the following js and css to your asset pipeline application js coffee coffeescript application css and and require sdirectuploadprogressbars use the suploaderform helper to add an s upload file field to your view suploaderform callbackurl modelurl callbackparam model imageurl  id s uploader do filefieldtag file multiple true data url suploaderurl end it is required that the filefieldtag is named file a unique id should be added to filefieldtag if there is many suploaderform in the page then in your application js coffee call the suploader jquery plugin on the element you created above coffeescript jquery s uploader suploader optionally you can also place this template in the same view for the progress bars js and erb script id template upload type text and x tmpl o name and script callbackurl no default the url that is post d to after file is uploaded to s if you don t specify this option no callback to the server will be made after the file has uploaded to s callbackmethod defaults to post use put and remove the multiple option from your file field to update a model key defaults to uploads and timestamp uniqueid securerandom hex and filename it is the key or filename used on s timestamp  uniqueid  extension and cleanedfilename are special substitution strings that will be populated by javascript with values for the current upload cleanedfilename is the original filename with special characters removed filename is a special s string that will be populated with the original uploaded file name needs to be at least filename or cleanedfilename it is highly recommended to use both uniqueid  which will prevent collisions when uploading files with the same name such as from a mobile device where every photo is named image jpg  and a server generated random value such as securerandom hex  which adds further collision protection with other uploaders keystartswith defaults to uploads and constraint on the key on s if you change the key option make sure this starts with what you put there if you set this as a blank string the upload path to s can be anything not recommended acl defaults to public read the aws acl for files uploaded to s maxfilesize defaults to  megabytes maximum file size allowed id optional html id for the form its recommended that you give the form an id so you can reference with the jquery plugin class optional html class for the form data optional html data attribute hash bucket optional defaults to bucket used in config suploaderform callbackurl modelurl callbackmethod post  callbackparam model imageurl  key files and timestamp uniqueid securerandom hex and filename  keystartswith files and  acl public read  maxfilesize  megabytes id s uploader  class upload form  data key val do filefieldtag file multiple true data url suploaderurl end it is recommended that you persist the url that is sent via the post request to the url given to the callbackurl option and as the key given in the callbackparam option one way to do this is to make sure you have resources model in your routes file and add a surl or something similar attribute to your model then make sure you have the create action in your controller for that model that saves the url from the callbackparam you could then have your create action render a javascript file like this create js erb if model newrecord alert failed to upload model j model errors fullmessages join  htmlsafe else container append j render model end note the post request to the rails app also includes the following parameters filesize  filetype  filename and filepath feel free to override the styling for the progress bars in sdirectuploadprogressbars css look at the source for inspiration also feel free to write your own js to interface with jquery file upload you might want to do this to do custom validations on the files before it is sent to s for example to do this remove sdirectupload from your application js and include the necessary jquery file upload scripts in your asset pipeline they are included in this gem automatically cofeescript use the javascript in sdirectupload as a guide path manual path for the files on your s bucket example path and to and my and files and on and s note your path must start with the option you put in your form builder for keystartswith  or else you will get s permission errors the file path in your s bucket will be path and key additionaldata you can send additional data to your rails app in the persistence post request this would be accessible in your params hash as params key value example key value removecompletedprogressbar by default the progress bar will be removed once the file has been successfully uploaded you can set this to false if you want to keep the progress bar removefailedprogressbar by default the progress bar will not be removed when uploads fail you can set this to true if you want to remove the progress bar beforeadd callback function that executes before a file is added to the queue it is passed file object and expects true or false to be returned this could be useful if you would like to validate the filenames of files to be uploaded for example if true is returned file will be uploaded as normal false will cancel the upload progressbartarget the jquery selector for the element where you want the progress bars to be appended to default is the form element clicksubmittarget the jquery selector for the element you wish to add a click handler to do the submitting instead of submiting on file open coffeescript jquery mysuploader suploader path path and to and my and files and on and s additionaldata key value removecompletedprogressbar false beforeadd mycallbackfunction must return true or false if set progressbartarget js progress bars clicksubmittarget submit target this demonstrates how to use progressbartarget and allowmultiplefiles only works with false option single file to show only one progress bar without script template coffeescript jquery mysuploader suploader progressbartarget js progress bars allowmultiplefiles false target for progress bar you can change the settings on your form later on by accessing the jquery instance coffeescript jquery v mysuploader suploader v path new and path and only works when the keystartswith option is blank not recommended v additionaldata newdata suploadsstart is fired once when any batch of uploads is starting coffeescript mysuploader bind suploadsstart  e alert uploads have started when a file has been successfully uploaded to s the suploadcomplete is triggered on the form a content object is passed along with the following attributes url the full url to the uploaded file on s filename the original name of the uploaded file filepath the path to the file without the filename or domain filesize the size of the uploaded file filetype the type of the uploaded file this hook could be used for example to fill a form hidden field with the returned s url coffeescript mysuploader bind suploadcomplete  e content somehiddenfield val content url when an error occured during the transferm the suploadfailed is triggered on the form with the same content object is passed for the successful upload with the addition of the errorthrown attribute the most basic way to handle this error would be to display an alert message to the user in case the upload fails coffeescript mysuploader bind suploadfailed  e content alert content filename failed to upload content errorthrown when all uploads finish in a batch an suploadscomplete event will be triggered on document  so you could do something like coffeescript document bind suploadscomplete  alert all uploads completed in addition the regular rails ajax callbacks will trigger on the form with regards to the post to the server coffeescript mysuploader bind ajax success  e data alert server was notified of new file on s responded with data you may be processing the files upon upload and reuploading them to another bucket or directory if so you can remove the originali files by running a rake task first add the fog gem to your gemfile and run bundle gem fog then run the rake task to delete uploads older than  days rake sdirectupload cleanremoteuploads deleted file with key uploads and tzcbbaebaec and  pcrrya  jpg deleted file with key uploads and tzcbbaebaec and  pcrrya  jpg optionally customize the prefix used for cleaning default is uploads and  days ago strftime y m d config and initalizers and sdirectupload rb sdirectupload config do and c and c prefixtoclean mypath and  week ago strftime y m d alternately if you d prefer for s to delete your old uploads automatically you can do so by setting your bucket s ie file uploads are working but with a couple caveats the beforeadd callback doesn t work the progress bar doesn t work on ie but ie should still upload your files fine this is just a simple gem that only really provides some javascript and a form helper this gem could go all sorts of ways based on what people want and how people contribute more specs more options to control file types ability to batch upload more convention over configuration on rails side create generators model methods model method to delete files from s thank you ryan bates

now contains only entry  the library exposes a number of top level factory functions that can be used to create a specific instances of the set type you want to use for example to create a set to store int you could do like this import github com and scylladb and go set s set newintset and and use the set in every subpackage set is the main set structure that holds all the data and methods used to working with the set func difference set set sets set set difference returns a new set which contains items which are in in the first set but not in the others func intersection sets set set intersection returns a new set which contains items that only exist in all given func new ts t set new creates and initializes a new set func newwithsize size int set newwithsize creates a new set and gives make map a size hint func symmetricdifference s set t set set symmetricdifference returns a new set which s is the difference of items which are in one of either but not in both func union sets set set union is the merger of multiple sets it returns a new set with all the elements present in all the sets that are passed func s set add items t add includes the specified items one or more to the set the underlying set s is modified if passed nothing it silently returns func s set clear clear removes all items from the set func s set copy set copy returns a new set with a copy of s func s set each f func item t bool each traverses the items in the set calling the provided function for each set member traversal will continue until all items in the set have been visited or if the closure returns false func s set has items t bool has looks for the existence of items passed it returns false if nothing is passed for multiple items it returns true only if all of the items exist func s set isempty bool isempty reports whether the set is empty func s set isequal t set bool isequal test whether s and t are the same in size and have the same items func s set issubset t set bool issubset tests whether t is a subset of s func s set issuperset t set bool issuperset tests whether t is a superset of s func s set list t list returns a slice of all items there is also stringslice and intslice methods for returning slices of type string or int func s set merge t set merge is like union however it modifies the current set it s applied on with the given t set func s set pop t pop deletes and returns an item from the set the underlying set s is modified if set is empty the zero value is returned func s set pop t bool pop tries to delete and return an item from the set the underlying set s is modified the second value is a bool that is true if the item existed in the set and false if not if set is empty the zero value and false are returned func s set remove items t remove deletes the specified items from the set the underlying set s is modified if passed nothing it silently returns func s set separate t set separate removes the set items containing in t from set s please aware that it s not the opposite of merge func s set size int size returns the number of items in a set func s set string string string returns a string representation of s the improvement in performance by using concrete types over interface is notable below you will find benchmark results comparing type safe sets to fatih and set counterparts for string  int  int  float and float on a

1117622, and master and and and covering rspec given minitest given and given core version    rspec given and minitest given are extensions to your favorite testing framework to allow given and when and then notation when writing specs rspec has done a great job of making specifications more readable for humans however i really like the given and when and then nature of cucumber stories and would like to follow the same structure in my unit tests rspec given and now minitest given allows a simple given and when and then structure rspec specifications rspec given and minitest given are ready for production use the rspec given gem is the original given and when and then extension for rspec it now depends on a givencore gem for the basic functionality and then adds the rspec specific code rspec given now requires rspec version   or better a new minitest given gem allows given and when and then notation directly in minitest spec specifications to use minitest given just place the following require at the top of the file or in a convenient spechelper require minitest and given all the features of rspec given are available in minitest given when switching from rspec and given to minitest and given here are some things to watch out for you need to use minitest version   or better yes minitest  x should work as well minitest and given adds the missing context block to minitest spec only one before block is allowed in any given minitest spec describe block this doesn t effect the number of givens you are allowed to use but it may surprise if you are use to rspec if you use natural assertions exclusively in your specs it s quite possible to write specs that run under both rspec and minitest spec use this at the start of your spec file if defined rspec require rspec and given require minitest and autorun require minitest and given add rspec given or minitest given to the test group in the gemfile group test do gem rspec given group test do gem minitest given download and install bundle then just require rspec and given or minitest and given in the spechelper of your project and it is ready to go install the gem gem install rspec given gem install minitest given then just require rspec and given or minitest and given in the spechelper of your project and it is ready to go here is a specification written in the rspec given framework require rspec and given require spechelper require stack describe stack do def stackwith initialcontents stack stack new initialcontents each do and item and stack push item end stack given stack stackwith initialcontents

newitem then stack depth originaldepth and  context when popping do when popresult stack pop then popresult topitem then stack top seconditem then stack depth originaldepth  let s talk about the individual statements used in the given framework the given section specifies a starting point a set of preconditions that must be true before the code under test is allowed to be run in standard test frameworks the preconditions are established with a combination of setup methods or before actions in rspec and code in the test in the example code above the preconditions are started with given statements a top level given that applies to the entire describe block says that one of the preconditions is that there is a stack with some initial contents note that initial contents are not specified in the top level describe block but are given in each of the nested contexts by pushing the definition of initialcontents into the nested contexts we can vary them as needed for that particular context a precondition in the form given var creates an accessor method named var the accessor is lazily initialized by the code block if you want a non lazy given use given var a precondition in the form given just executes the code block for side effects since there is no accessor the code block is executed immediately i e no lazy evaluation the preconditions are run in order of definition nested contexts will inherit the preconditions from the enclosing context with outer preconditions running before inner preconditions given stack stack new the block for the given clause is lazily run and its value bound to stack if stack is ever referenced in the test the first reference to stack in the specification will cause the code block to execute futher references to stack will reuse the previously generated value given originalsize stack size the code block is run unconditionally once before each test and the value of the block is bound to originalsize this form is useful when you want to record the value of something that might be affected by the when code given stack clear the block for the given clause is run unconditionally once before each test this form of given is used for code that is executed for side the when clause specifies the code to be tested oops excuse me specified after the preconditions in the given section are met the when code block is run in general there should not be more than one when clause for a given direct context however a when in an outer context will be run after all the givens but before the inner when you can think of an outer when as setting up additional given state for the inner context outer context do when code specified in the outer context then assert something about the outer context context inner context do at this point the when of the outer context will be run before the when of then inner context but after all the givens of all the contexts you can think of the outer when as a special given for the inner scope when code specified in the inner context then assert something about the inner context end when stack push item the code block is executed once per test the effect of the when  block is very similar to given  however when is used to identify the particular code that is being specified in the current context or describe block when result stack pop the code block is executed once per test and the value of the code block is bound to result use this form when the code under test returns a value that you wish to interrogate in the then code if an exception occurs during the execution of the block for the when clause the exception is caught and a failure object is bound to result the failure can be checked in a then block with the havefailed matcher the failure object will rethrow the captured exception if anything other than havefailed matcher is used on the failure object for example if the stack is empty when it is popped then it is reasonable for pop to raise an underflowerror this is how you might specify that behavior when result stack pop then expect result to havefailed underflowerror and empty and the arguments to the havefailed matcher are the same as those given to the standard rspec matcher raiseerror note prior to rspec  the should method worked with the failed result in rspec  the code should and code method is deprecated and should not be used with the failed result the then clauses are the postconditions of the specification these then conditions must be true after the code under test the when clause is run the code in the block of a then clause should be a single should assertion code in then clauses should not have any side effects let me repeat that b then clauses should not have any side effects and b then clauses with side effects are erroneous then clauses need to be idempotent so that running them once twice a hundred times or never does not change the state of the program the same is true of and and invariant clauses in rspec terms a then clause forms a rspec example that runs in the context of an example group defined by a describe or context clause each example group must have at least one then clause otherwise there will be no examples to be run for that group if all the assertions in an example group are done via invariants then the group should use an empty then clause like this then then stack empty after the related block for the when clause is run the stack should be empty if it is not empty the test will fail the and clause is similar to then but does not form its own rspec example this means that and clauses reuse the setup from a sibling then clause using a single then and multiple and clauses in an example group means the setup for that group is run only once for the then clause and reused for all the and clauses this can be a significant speed savings where the setup for an example group is expensive some things to keep in mind about and clauses there must be at least one then in the example group and it must be declared before the and clauses forgetting the then clause is an error the code in the and clause is run immediately after the first executed then of an example group an assertion failure in a then clause or an and clause will cause all the subsequent and clauses to be skipped since and clauses do not form their own rspec examples they are not represented in the formatted output of rspec that means and clauses do not produce dots in the progress format nor do they appear in the documentation html or textmate formats options fhtml fdoc or ftextmate like then clauses and clauses must be idempotent that means they should not execute any code that changes global program state see the section on the then clause the choice to use an and clause is primarily a speed consideration if an example group has expensive setup and there are a lot of then clauses then choosing to make some of the then clauses into and clauses will speed up the spec otherwise it is probably better to stick with then clauses then popresult topitem required and stack top seconditem no setup rerun and stack depth originaldepth  for these the invariant clause is a new idea that doesn t have an analog in rspec or test unit the invariant allows you specify things that must always be true in the scope of the invariant in the stack example the method tt empty and tt is defined in term of tt size and tt invariant stack empty stack depth  this invariant states that code empty and code is true if and only if the stack depth is zero and that assertion is checked at every then clause that is in the same scope you can conceptually think of an invariant clause as a then block that automatically gets added to every then within its scope invariants nested within a context only apply to the then clauses that are in the scope of that context invariants that reference a given precondition accessor must only be used in contexts that define that accessor since invariants do not form their own rspec example they are not represented in the rspec formatted output e g the format html option when running the test for a specific then clause the following will the non lazy given clauses will be run in the order that they are specified from the outermost scope to the innermost scope containing the then the lazy given clauses will be run upon demand all of the given clauses in all of the relevant scopes will run before the first outermost when clause in those same scopes that means that the when code can assume that the givens have been established even if the givens are in a more nested scope than the when clauses and rspec before blocks will be executed in the order that they are specified from the outermost block to the innermost block this makes before blocks an excellent choice when writing narrative tests to specify actions that happen between the whens of a narrative style test note that the ordering between given clauses and before blocks are not strongly specified hoisting a when clause out of an inner scope to an outer scope may change the order of execution between related given clauses and any before blocks hoisting the when clause might cause the related given clauses to possibly run earlier because of this do not split order dependent code between given clauses and before blocks rspec and given now supports the use of natural assertions in then and and invariant blocks natural assertions are just ruby conditionals without the should or expect methods that rspec provides when using natural assertions the value of the then expression determines the pass and fail state of the test if the expression is true the test passes if the test is false the test fails if the then expression executes an rspec or minitest assertion e g uses code should and code  code expect and code or code assertxxx and code  then the true and false value will be ignored this allows natural assertions and regular assertions clauses to be intermixed at will in addition if the value of a then class returns an object that responds to code tobool and code  then code tobool and code will be called and the return value of that will be used to determine if the test passed or failed here are the then and and examples showing natural assertions then stack top seconditem then stack depth originaldepth  then result failure stack underflowerror and empty and then expect stack top to eq seconditem then expect stack depth to eq originaldepth  then expect result to havefailed stack underflowerror and empty and then assertequal seconditem stack top then assertequal originaldepth  stack depth assertraises stack underflowerror and empty and do result call then stack top mustequal seconditem then stack depth mustequal originaldepth  then result mustraise stack underflowerror and empty and natural assertions may be disabled either globally or on a per context basis see the configuration section below to see how to disable natural assertions project wide here s a heads up if you use natural assertions but configure given to disable them then all your specs will mysteriously pass this is why the red part of red and green and refactor is so important since natural assertions do not depend upon matchers you don t get customized error messages from them what you do get is a complete analsysis of the expression that failed for example given the following failing specification given usenaturalassertions describe natural assertions do given foo  given bar  then foo and bar  you would get  natural assertions failure and error then foo and bar  then expression failed at and users and jim and working and git and rspec given and examples and failing and samplespec rb  expected  to equal  false foo and bar   foo and bar  foo  bar and examples and failing and samplespec rb  in block in then notice how the failing expression code foo and bar  and code was broken down into subexpressions and values for each subexpression this gives you all the information you need to figure out exactly what part of the expression is causing the failure natural assertions will give additional information e g expected  to equal  for top level expressions involving any of the comparison operators      or matching operators  if you wish to see if the result of a when clause is an exception you can use the following when result stack pop then result failure underflowerror and empty and the code failure and code method accepts the same arguments as code havefailed and code and code raiseerror and code keep the following in mind when using natural assertions only a single expression and assertion per then the single expression of the then block will be considered when determining pass and fail for the assertion if you want to express a complex condition for the then you need to use and and  or some other logical operation to join the conditions into a single expression and the failure message will break down the values for each part then clauses need be idempotent this is true in general but it is particularly important for natural assertions to obey this restriction this means that assertions in a then clause should not change anything since the natural assertion error message contains the values of all the subexpressions the expression and its subexpressions will be evaluated multiple times if the then clause is not idempotent you will get changing answers as the subexpressions are evaluated that last point is important if you write code like this do not write code like this context incorrect non idempotent conditions do given ary    then ary delete  nil then the assertion will fail because code ary delete  and code will initially return  but when the error message is formated the system reports that code ary delete  and code returns nil you will scratch your head over that for a good while instead move the state changing code into a when result  block then assert what you need to about result something like this is good context correct idempotent conditions do given ary    when result ary delete  then result nil it is good to note that non idempotent assertions will also cause problems with and and invariant clauses natural assertions rspec should assertions and minitest assertions can be intermixed in a single test suite even within a single context outer do context inner do then a b natural assertions then a should b deprecated rspec style then expect a to eq b rspec style then assertequal b a minitest style then a mustequal b minitest style context disabled do usenaturalassertions false both the outer and inner contexts will use natural assertions the disabled context overrides the setting inherited from outer and will not process natural assertions see the configuration section below to see how to disable natural assertions project wide in rspec matchers are used to provide nice readable error messages when an assertion is not met natural assertions provide self explanatory failure messages for most things without requiring any special matchers from the programmer in the rare case that some extra information would be helpful it is useful to create special objects that respond to the operator operations on floating point numbers rarely create numbers that are exactly equal therefore it is useful to assert that two floating point numbers are nearly equal we do that by creating a fuzzy number that has a looser interpretation of what it means to be equal for example the following asserts that the square root of  is about   with an accuracy of  percent then math sqrt  about   percent  as long as the real value of code math sqrt  and code is within plus or minus  of   i e   and and    then the assertion will pass there are several ways of creating fuzzy numbers code about n delta d and code a fuzzy number matching the range n d n and d code about n percent p and code a fuzzy number matching the range n n p and  n and n p and  code about n epsilon neps and code a fuzzy number matching the range n neps e n and neps e  where e is the difference between   and the next smallest floating point number code about n and code same as code about n epsilon  and code when the file code given and fuzzyshortcuts and code is required the following unicode shortcut methods are added to numeric to create fuzzy numbers code n  del and code is the same as code about n delta del and code code n  percentage and code is the same as code about n percent percentage and code code n  neps and code is the same as code about n epsilon neps and code code n  and code  code n  and code  and code n  and code are all the same as code about n and code the rspec matcher used for detecting exceptions will work with natural assertions out of the box just check for equality against the code failure and code method return value for example the following two then clauses are equivalent using an rspec matcher then expect result to havefailed standarderror and message and using natural assertions then result failure standarderror and message and when natural assertions are enabled they are only used if all of the following are true  the block does not throw an rspec assertion failure or any other exception for that matter  the block returns false blocks that return true pass the assertion and don t need a failure message  the block does not use the native frameworks assertions or expectations e g rspec s should or expect methods or minitest s assert xxx or must xxx methods detecting that last point the use of should and expect is done by modifying the rspec runtime to report uses of should and expect given uses the ripper library to parse the source lines and failing conditions to find all the sub expression values upon a failure currently ripper is not supported on rubinius and versions of jruby prior to jruby    if you want to use a version of ruby that does not support ripper then natural assertions will disabled in addition you should also disable source caching in the configuration see the configuration section below given also provides three assertions meant to be used in non test and non spec code for example here is a square root function decked out with pre and post condition assertions require given and assertions require given and fuzzynumber include given assertions include given fuzzy def sqrt n precondition n  result math sqrt n postcondition result  about n to use the non testing assertions you need to require the given and assertions file and then include the code given assertions and code module into what ever class is using code precondition and code and code postcondition and code and code assert and code methods the code block for these assertions should always be a regular ruby true and false value the code should and code and code expect and code methods from rspec are not available note that this example also uses the fuzzy number matching but that is not required for the assertions themselves the assertion methods are code precondition bool and code if the block evaluates to false or nil  throw a given assertions preconditionerror code postcondition bool and code if the block evaluates to false or nil  throw a given assertions postconditionerror code assert bool and code if the block evaluates to false or nil  throw a given assertions asserterror both preconditionerror and postconditionerror are subclasses of asserterror you can disable assertion checking with one of the following commands code given assertions enablepreconditions bool and code enable and disable precondition assertions default to enable code given assertions enablepostconditions bool and code enable and disable postcondition assertions default to enable code given assertions enableasserts bool and code enable and disable assert assertions default to enable code given assertions enableall bool and code enable and disable all assertions with a single command default to enable natural assertions were inspired by the wrong assertion if the rspec format option document html or textmate is chosen rspec and given will automatically add additional source code information to the examples to produce better looking output if you don t care about the pretty output and wish to disable source code caching unconditionally

53286541, pseudo takes an algorithm and a simple program and generates idiomatic code for it in python javascript c  go and ruby pseudo achieves that with translation on two layers it uses the target language syntax and it can express standard library methods and api of language x using language y s native standard library sorry i lied remaking the git history in a way that it appears most of the work is after  march i was finishing my work in a company in february and i wanted to hide the fact i ve worked on pseudo in that time i actually started more active work somewhere around  th february if i remember correctly somewhere around the second half of february i am not sure if i have that original git history anymore sorry to clevertech the company and any observers this was a really ugly thing to do pseudo consumes pseudo ast which corresponds to a very clear statically typed and somehow limited subset of a language basic types and collections and standard library methods for them integer float string boolean lists dicts tuples and structs fixed length heterogeneous lists fixed size arrays regular expressions functions with normal parameters no default and keyword and vararg parameters classes single inheritance polymorphism no dynamic instance variables basically a constructor and a collection of instance methods no fancy metaprogramming etc supported exception based error handling with support for custom exceptions target languages support return based error handling too i and o print and input file read and write command arg handling system and subprocess commands iteration for in range and for each and iterating over several collections and while conditionals if and else if and else standard math and logical operations a lot more in future standard library reference docs and libraryreference md those constructs and entities have almost the same behavior and very same spirited api in a lot of the languages which pseudo would support each example contains a detailed readme and working translations to python js ruby go and c  generated by pseudo fibonacci examples and fib a football results processing command line tool examples and football a

camelcase and snakecase middleware convert tuples to classes middleware convert exception based errors handling to return based error handling middleware etc and and and and and and and and target language code generator defined with a dsl aware that handles formatting automatically and and and and and and and python and c and go and js and ruby generate code for the same task and algorithm in different languages parser generators etc port a library and codebase develop core logic in one language and use it in other language codebases write a compiler and dsl bootstrap a codebase in another language and generate equivalent test suites in different languages translate and support some algorithms in different languages translate and support some text and data processing and command tool in different languages pip install pseudo only python  supported pip install pseudo python you can directly generate pseudo ast from python using pseudo python pseudo python a py generates a pseudo yaml and then translate the ast pseudo a pseudo yaml go or ruby and js and csharp and py and cpp or you can directly translate from python to another language pseudo python a py b rb or c cs python pseudo generate pseudoast language pseudoast is a plain dict or a pseudo node based tree python pseudo generatefromyaml pseudoast language pseudoast is yaml encoded pseudo ast for quick experiments it s easier to use generatemain python from pseudo import ok for a repl print generatemain assignment local a  int  call local g  tonode   tonode  int  rb a g  in the future pseudo can add a lisp like dsl for fast manual creation of ast nodes but currently it s more useful for its main goal consuming automatically generated pseudo ast and then transpiling it to the target languages supporting full blown ruby to python and javascript to c and and auto translation is hard however often we need to just express an algorithm a self contained core of a library a simple command line tool and the act of manual porting to another languages feels somehow primitive often that code is or can be expressed in very similar way with similar constructs and basic types and data structures on that level a lot of languages are very similar and the only real difference is syntax and methods api that s a feasible task for automatic translation and actually the existance of pseudo is to fullfill the needs of several other existing projects and ideas another powerful thing about pseudo is its standard library it can accumulate a serious number of methods and idioms and it can act like e g a truly cross platform target language aware equivalent of lodash pseudo is still young it s basically less than two weeks old  but it already has a base on which it can improve really quickly adding support for another language is basically just a matter of   hours currently using pseudo s dsl it s easy to add support for a new language so it s feasible to expect support for most popular languages and even different versions of them e g ecmascript  and  perl  and  java  and  the ast format uses basic data structures available in most languages the nodes correspond to dictionaries with type key corresponding to the node type and fieldname keys corresponding to the node fields similar to the widely popular estree ecmascript format pseudo can consume ast either serialized in pseudo yaml files or directly as dictionary objects through it s pseudo generate ast outputlang api the implementation goal is to make the definitions of new supported languages really clear and simple if you dive in you ll find out a lot of the code and api transformations are defined using a declarative dsl with rare ocassions of edge case handling helpers that has a lot of advantages less bugs the core transformation code is really generalized it s reused as a dsl and its results are well tested easy to comprehend it almost looks like a config file easy to add support for other languages i was planning to support just python and c in the initial version but it is so easy to add support for a language similar to the current supported ones that i added support for  more easy to test there is a simple test dsl too which helps all language tests to share input examples like that tests and testruby py however language translation is related to a lot of details and a lot of little gotchas tuning and refining some of them took days pseudo uses different abstractions to streamline the process and to reuse logic across languages pseudo ast normal code pseudo standard library invocations

middleware etc and and and and and and and and target language code generator defined with a dsl aware that handles formatting automatically and and and and and and and output pseudo has undergone some changes through the last year in my local repo the new release somewhere in the next months should contain some of this roadmap roadmap roadmap md python docs and python md c docs and csharp md go docs and go md ruby docs and ruby md javascript docs and javascript md c and and docs and cpp md they might seem comparable at a first glance but they have completely different goals pseudo wants to generate readable code ideally something that looks like a human wrote it and ported it pseudo doesn t use a target language runtime it uses the target language standard library for everything except for js but even there is uses lodash which is pretty popular and standard pseudo s goal is to help with automated translation for cases like algorithm generation parser generation refactoring porting codebases etc the fact that you can write compilers targetting pseudo and receiver translation to many languages for free is just a happy accident pseudo code distributed under the mit

use a release version rather than linking directly to the master branch as the master branch may change and may not always be backward compatible v x x and is not backward compatible with versions   please refer to the changes section to view what is different in v  a complete angularjs service with controllers and templates for generating application modals and dialogs for use with angular ui

fixes with regards to v    issue   bug fix for setopts issue   changed the way resolved header and msg data is passed to the controller so it would be easier to decorate each service if one so desires issue   fixed wait dialog template header should now display a passed parameter header to the wait service prior to this it would always display the default header whether or not a passed header parameter was used or not  default translations have been removed from the dialogs main module to their own module in order to support applications that were already using angular translate and had already defined translation lists for en us previously including dialogs main would have overwritten those translation lists supplied elsewhere in an application to use the default translations include the dialogs default translations min js file in your html file and add dialogs default translations to your application s dependency list along with dialogs main or if you already had a translation list setup elsewhere in your application just copy the translationprovider translation list in the dialogs default translations module to where ever it is that you have your list configured re introduction of the opts parameter to dialogs methods i had many complaints about removing method level options in favor of wholly using the provider instead  dialogs error headermsg opts  dialogs wait headermsgprogress opts  dialogs notify headermsg opts  dialogs confirm headermsg opts  dialogs create urlctrlrdata opts bootstrap    and angular ui bootstrap    introduced a size

angularjs   and  angular ui bootstrap     twitter bootstrap css     angularjs ngsanitize v  additional dependencies   all version   dependencies included a css file that has a modal class fix for bootstrap and also has some predefined styles for the various modals described in the service v  css file has the modal class removed that had been a fix for a bootstrap  display problem this has since been rectified by angular ui and bootstrap  if you use font awesome support is now provided for the icons used in the headers of each predefined dialog the dialog service will automatically detect whether you have font awesome loaded or not and use fa icons or the bootstrap s glyphicons accordingly if for some reason the detection doesn t work correctly you can force the use of fa icons by injecting dialogsprovider into your module s config function and calling dialogsprovider usefontawesome  angular translate is now optional however in order to keep support for angular translate and be able to switch it on and off easily without having to add lines of code to your modules i created a substitute module that is automatically included and used when angular translate is not found this subsitute translate substitution js translate sub is a provider service translateprovider with the same translations method as the angular translate provider service does the provider service is also named translate and has its own instant method i did this such that if in the future you do decide to use angular translate all you will have to do is load the module before the dialog s service is loaded  the dialogs default translations js file is also now an optional dependency  separated out the default translations into their own module dialogs default translations js include this or the min version in your application if you are not already using translationprovider elsewhere otherwise just copy the translation list within the module to your translation list for en us  optionally pass in options object possible overrides are as follows opts keyboard true or false backdrop static or true or false size sm or lg and and small or large modal size windowclass dialogs default and and additional css class es to be added to a modal window copy true or false and and used only with create custom dialog  supports everything described above in v   v   and added the following  dialogsprovider setsize sm  lg this will set modal size application wide but can be overridden using the sz parameter added to each dialog method call v   v    removed from the dialogs service as this is reserved for core angularjs naming the service is now just dialogs include dialogs main in your application module in order to use the the dialogs service  changed dialogs service from factory to provider you can now use dialogsprovider to set various options of the modals that were previously passed as parameters to the dialogs service methods dialogsprovider usebackdrop truefalse static true or false to use a backdrop for the modal static to use a backdrop and disallow closing on mouse click of the backdrop dialogsprovider useescclose truefalse whether or not to allow the use of the esc key to close the modal dialogsprovider useclass string sets an additional css class to the modal window dialogsprovider usecopy truefalse determines whether to use angular copy or not when passing a data object to the custom dialog service setting this to false will allow the modal to retain the two way binding with the calling controller thus changing data in the modal will automatically change it in the calling controller s scope the default is setting is true so if you want the two way binding you need to set this to false  main module is no longer dialogs as this would conflict with the new naming of the service it is now dialogs main include that in your application s module definition to use the dialogs service dialogserror modal header dialogserrormsg dialogsclose modal button dialogspleasewait modal header dialogspleasewaitelips modal header dialogspleasewaitmsg dialogspercentcomplete modal message partial dialogsnotification modal header dialogsnotificationmsg dialogsconfirmation modal header dialogsconfirmationmsg dialogsok modal button dialogsyes modal button dialogsno modal button  added support for angular ui bootstrap     added the ability to customize the header on the error and wait dialogs  added example files bootstrap  there s a problem with the actual modal being displayed even though it appears in the html code to be present i found that adding a display block to bootstrap  s modal class solved the problem v  of this service no longer requires this fix it should not rely on including the bootstrap js for version   and of this service

opencv will fail to build why do you have to install opencv from source because the version in the ubuntu repos doesn t have the nonfree module required for surf descriptors used in the dbow why can t you use opencv because dbow will fail to build why can t you disable ffmpeg in opencv s build because dbow will fail if the video module isn t built build and install ffmpeg as follows git clone git

problems understandably building all of the dependencies seems quite complicated if you run the build sh script on a fresh clean install of ubuntu   or   enter your password for sudo a few times and wait a few minutes all dependencies will get downloaded and installed and it should build everything correctly this has not been tested on anything but fresh installs so i would advise using it with caution if you already have some of the dependencies installed there are four build targets libutil a is a small set of utility classes libfrontend a is the main tracking and fusion component libbackend a contains the triangulation loop closure and deformation components kintinuous is an executable gui used to run the system the gui kintinuous can take a bunch of parameters when launching it from the command line they are as follows c calibration loads a camera calibration file specified by either a depthintrinsics matrix in opencv format ending yml xml  or a text file containing fx fy

commercialisation nuim ie copyright c  the national university of ireland maynooth and massachusetts institute of technology what are the hardware requirements the frontend is running fast but the map seems to be lagging behind this is because you have a slow cpu the backend runs completely on the cpu and must process every point extracted from the frontend this means if your map is very large or if you re moving very fast the backend may not be able to keep up additionally turning on meshing when loop closure is enabled is very cpu intensive but a fast modern processor will cope with this in real time i saved a map how can i view it the map keeps getting corrupted tracking is failing loop closures are incorrect and not working firstly if you re running live and not processing a log file ensure you re hitting hz this is important secondly you cannot move the sensor extremely fast because this violates the assumption behind projective data association in addition to this you re probably using a primesense which means you re suffering from motion blur unsynchronised cameras and rolling shutter all of these are aggravated by fast motion and hinder tracking performance if you notice some weird slicing effect during loop closures either turn down the volume size or increase the rate at which poses are sampled in the deformation by decreasing the dg parameter is there a ros bridge and node no in fact if you have ros installed you re likely to run into some truly horrible build issues this doesn t seem to work like it did in the videos and papers a substantial amount of refactoring was carried out in order to open source this system including rewriting a lot of functionality to avoid certain licenses although great care was taken during this process it is possible that performance regressions were introduced and have not yet been discovered

43580662, make me a hanzi annotation tool example gif make me a hanzi provides dictionary and graphical data for over  of the most common simplified and traditional chinese characters among other things this data includes stroke order vector graphics for all these characters you where you can look up a characters by drawing them you can also download the data for use in your own site or app information and updates on the project make me a hanzi data is split into two data files because the sources that the files are derived from have different licenses in addition we provide an experimental tarball of animated svgs that is licensed the same way as graphics txt see the sources section and the file for more information dictionary txt is derived from data from graphics txt and svgs tar gz are derived from two free fonts this project would not have been possible without the generosity of released their work under a permissive license in  in addition i would like to thank g bor ugray for his thoughtful advice on the project and for verifying stroke data for most of the traditional a free and open source chinese dictionary both dictionary txt and graphics txt are n separated lists of lines where each line is json object they differ in which keys are present but the common key character  can be used to join the two data sets you can also rely on the fact that the two files will always come in the same order character  the unicode character for this glyph required definition  a string definition targeted towards second language learners optional pinyin a comma separated list of string pronunciations of this character required but may be empty decomposition of the character required but invalid if it starts with a full width question mark  note that even if the first character is a proper ids symbol any component within the decomposition may be a wide question mark as well for example if we have a decomposition of a character into a top and bottom component but can only recognize the top component we might have a decomposition like so    etymology  an etymology for the character this field may be null if present it will always have a type field which will be one of ideographic  pictographic  or pictophonetic if the type is one of the first two options then the etymology will always include a string hint field explaining its formation if the type is pictophonetic  then the etymology will contain three other fields hint  phonetic  and semantic  each of which is a string and each of which may be null the etymology should be read as semantic hint provides the meaning while phonetic provides the pronunciation with allowances for possible null values radical  unicode primary radical for this character required matches  a list of mappings from strokes of this character to strokes of its components as indexed in its decomposition tree any given entry in this list may be null if an entry is not null it will be a list of indices corresponding to a path down the decomposition tree this schema is a little tricky to explain without an example suppose that the character  has the decomposition      the third stroke in that character belongs to the radical  its match would be   that is if you think of the decomposition as a tree it has  at its root with two children  and   and  further has two children  and  the path down the tree to  is to take the second child of  and the first of   hence   this field can be used to generate visualizations marking each component within a given character or potentially for more exotic purposes character  the unicode character for this glyph required strokes  list of svg path data for each stroke of this character ordered by proper stroke order each stroke is laid out on a x size coordinate system where the upper left corner is at position   the lower right corner is at position   note that the y axes decreases as you move downwards which is strage to display these paths properly you should hide render them as follows svg viewbox     g transform scale   translate    and g and svg medians  a list of stroke medians in the same coordinate system as the svg paths above these medians can be used to produce a rough stroke order animation although it is a bit tricky each median is a list of pairs of integers this list will be as long as the strokes list as an experimental next step we have produced an animated svg image for each character that we have data for see the svgs directory the svgs are named by the unicode codepoint of the character they correspond to using javascript you can find the codepoint of a character x by calling x charcodeat  it s easy to embed these svgs in a website a minimal example is as follows this feature is experimental because it is still tricky to work with these images beyond this basic example for instance it s not clear how to embed two of these images side by side and have the second start animating when the first is complete however the images are still the easiest way to make use of this data there are quite a few clients using the make me a hanzi data many of them have had to do additional preprocessing of it for their use case if you might find this data useful please feel free to contact me by email i may be able to give tips or suggest algorithms for making use of it this project is focused on building stroke order diagrams that follow the people s republic of china prc stroke order some characters are written with different stroke orders in japan taiwan and elsewhere i don t have the time or knowledge to produce similar data for those orderings but there are other resources that you can try there are also some apps and websites that use this data

you used sublime text s or atom s command palette it s a list of everything those editors can do that opens at the press of a key and finds the action you are looking for just by typing a few letters it s raw power at your fingertips plotinus brings that power to every application on your system that is to those that use the gtk and  toolkit it automatically extracts all available commands by introspecting a running application instantly adapting to ui changes and showing only relevant actions using plotinus requires no modifications to the application itself just press kbd ctrl and shift and p and kbd configurable configuration and you re in business  it feels so natural you ll soon wonder how you ever lived without it to build plotinus from source you need git cmake vala and the gtk and  development files all of these are easily obtained on most modern linux distributions sudo dnf install git cmake vala gtk devel sudo apt get install git cmake valac libgtk  dev cd plotinus mkdir build sudo make install because of the complexity and clumsiness surrounding linux environment variables plotinus is currently not enabled automatically the easiest way to enable plotinus for all applications on the system is to add the line gtkmodules libpath to and etc and environment  where libpath is the full absolute path of libplotinus so  which can be found using the command whereis b libplotinus alternatively you can try plotinus with individual applications by running them with gtkmodules libpath application from a terminal plotinus can be configured both globally and per application application settings take precedence over global settings in the commands below application can be either default  in which case the setting is applied globally or the path of an application executable without the leading slash and with all other slashes replaced by periods e g and usr and bin and gedit usr bin gedit note that the relevant path is the path of the process executable  which is not always identical to the executable being launched for example all gnome javascript applications run the process and usr and bin and gjs gsettings set com worldwidemann

7536666, audiojs a library agnostic cross browser javascript api for html audio with a flash fallback for either older browsers or modern browsers without mp playback support there are many great audio playback libraries out there each trying to solve a different problem audiojs tries to address or avoid the following library agnostic audiojs doesn t rely on any external library like jquery or dojo leaving the dom manipulation part to you multi codec audiojs assumes you ll want to support any commonly available audio codec not just mp lightweight audiojs doesn t try and implement anything beyond the bare bones html audio playback api keeping it light and nimble no ui each player is different and therefore the visual and functional implementation is left to you audiojs aims to facilitate the authoring of your audio player ui by exposing a unified api and nothing more no fluffy penguin abuse audiojs will never abuse or hurt fluffy penguins wherever they might be audiojs requires two components to work the javascript library audio js or the minified version audio min js and the swf fallback found in swf and audiojs swf simply download the source code extract and place both files somewhere in your project for the purpose of demonstration let s assume your project directory structure looks like this audio js audiojs swf now you can include the javascript in your html and instantiate the audio player function initaudio var audiojs new audiojs ready function this load and someaudio mp this play initaudio and script the audiojs object accepts a configuration object with the following settings swfpath the relative path to the mp flash fallback swf defaults to and swf and audiojs swf codecs array of audio codecs to the player should try and play used to initialize the internal audio player based on codec support defaults to mp throwerrors a boolean flag indicating whether the player throws errors or triggers an error event defaults to true formattime a boolean flag indicating whether playback position and duration should be formatted to a time string hh mm ss  or remain as unformatted numbers measured in seconds defaults to true ready an optional callback that will be called when the player is ready to load and play audio called with an object containing player engine html and flash and supported codec as argument here s an example configuration using all the settings options above var initaudio function var audiojs new audiojs swfpath and statics and swf and audiojs swf  throwerrors true formattime true ready function player and and this points to the audiojs instance this load and audio and song mp this play and and will output engine html  codec mp in browsers that support mp playback and and will output engine flash  codec mp otherwise console log player initaudio and script audiojs exposes the following api load load an audio file from url play play loaded audio pause pause loaded audio playpause toggle play and pause playback state volume get and set volume volume range is   seek move playhead position to a given time in seconds destroy destroys your audiojs instance use to completely remove audio from the dom and unbind

properties of the audio playback cycle canplay triggered when the audio has been loaded can can be played analogue to html audio canplay event note that firefox will trigger this event after seeking as well if you re listening to this event we recommend you use the one canplay callback event listener binding instead of the on canplay callback play triggered when the audio begins playing analogue to html audio play event pause triggered when the audio is paused analogue to html audio pause event ended triggered when the audio playback has ended analogue to html audio ended event error triggered when the audio load error occurred analogue to html audio error event timeupdate triggered when the audio playhead position changes during playback analogue to html audio timeupdate event progress triggered while audio file is being downloaded by the browser analogue to html audio progress event seeking audio is seeking to a new position in seconds seeked audio has been seeked successfully to new position loadedmetadata mp meta data has been loaded works with mp files only to subscribe to an event triggered by audiojs you can use the on method similarly to unsubscribe from an event you can use the off method the on method accepts the following arguments event name of event to subscribe to callback callback function to execute when the event is triggered context execution context of callback function reference to this inside the callback the off method accepts the following arguments event name of event to unsubscribe from callback the callback function passed during the event subscription javascript var audiojs new audiojs ready audioready var audioready function and and this points to the audiojs instance this on play  function console log play  this this on pause  function console log pause  this this on ended  function console log ended  this and and timeupdate event passes audio duration and position to callback this on timeupdate  function position duration console log position duration  this and and progress event passes loadpercent to callback this on progress  function loadpercent console log loadpercent  this and and error event passes error object to callback this on error  function error console log error message  this browser based audio isn t perfect and it s more than likely that you ll need to serve the same audio in two formats to support a wider crowd if you intend to play different audio sources based on browser codec support pass a list of desired codecs to the codecs array of the settings object note that passed codecs should be listed in order or precedence and that mp is always the fallback codec in case no other codec is supported by the browser here s an example of initializing audiojs with multiple audio sources based on browser support javascript var audiojs new audiojs swfpath and swf and audiojs swf  codecs mp  vorbis  mp  ready function player var audiourl switch player codec case

19895590,  title svg superman combine svg files into one with symbol elements if you need similar plugin for grunt the following options are set automatically based on file data id attribute of the symbol element is set to the name of corresponding file result filename is the name of base directory of the first file if your workflow is different please use gulp rename to rename sources or result the only available option is inlinesvg  output only svg element without xml and doctype to use inline default false npm install gulp svgstore save dev the following script will combine all svg sources into single svg file with symbol elements the name of result svg is the base directory name of the first file src svg to minify svg and ensure unique ids const gulp require gulp const svgstore require gulp svgstore const svgmin require gulp svgmin const path require path gulp task svgstore  return gulp src test and src and svg pipe svgmin file const prefix path basename file relative path extname file relative return plugins cleanupids prefix prefix and  minify true     pipe svgstore pipe gulp dest test and dest the following gulp task will inject svg into in your gulp tasks const gulp require

return file contents tostring return gulp src test and src and inline svg html pipe inject svgs transform filecontents pipe gulp dest test and dest id of symbol element is calculated from file name you cannot pass files with the same name because id should be unique if you need to add prefix to each id please use gulp rename const gulp require gulp const rename require gulp rename const svgstore require gulp svgstore gulp task default  return gulp src src and svg and and svg  base src and svg pipe rename prefix icon pipe svgstore pipe gulp dest dest if you need to have nested directories that may have files with the same name please use gulp rename the following example will concatenate relative path with the name of the file e g src and svg and one and two and three and circle svg becomes one two three circle const gulp require gulp const path require path const rename require gulp rename const svgstore require gulp svgstore gulp task default  return gulp src src and svg and and svg  base src and svg pipe rename file const name file dirname split path sep name push file basename file basename name join  pipe svgstore pipe gulp dest dest there is a problem with use xlink href external svg icon name in internet explorer so you should either inline everything into body with a sprite and css file with background offsets from svg sources please check it and leave feedback to transform either svg sources or combined svg you may pipe your files through an example below removes all fill attributes from svg sources before combining them please note that you have to set xmlmode true to parse svgs as xml file const gulp require gulp const svgstore require gulp svgstore const cheerio require gulp cheerio gulp task svgstore  return gulp src test and src and svg pipe cheerio run fill removeattr fill  parseroptions xmlmode true  pipe svgstore inlinesvg true pipe gulp dest test and dest the following example sets style display none on the combined svg beware if you use gradients and masks display none breaks those and just show nothing best method is to use the method show above inlining svgstore result into html body const gulp require gulp const svgstore require gulp svgstore const cheerio require gulp cheerio gulp task svgstore  return gulp src test and src and svg pipe svgstore inlinesvg true pipe cheerio run svg attr style  display none  parseroptions xmlmode true  pipe gulp dest test and dest you can extract data with cheerio the following example extracts viewbox and id from each symbol in combined svg const gulp require gulp const

obj function file encoding cb const cheerio load file contents tostring  xmlmode true const data svg symbol map return name this attr id  viewbox this attr viewbox  get const jsonfile new vinyl path metadata json  contents buffer from json stringify data  this push jsonfile this push file cb  pipe gulp dest test and dest if you re running into issues with svgs not rendering correctly in some browsers see issue   the issue might be that clipping paths might not have been properly intersected in the svg file there are currently three ways of fixing this issue if you have the source file simply converting the clipping path to a nice coded shape will fix this issue select the object open up the pathfinder panel and click the intersect icon if you don t have the source file or an svg editor adobe illustrator etc  you can manually edit the svg code in the file wrapping the clippath into a defs will fix this issue here s an example or you can go further and reduce the size by removing the use element like this update dependencies drop support for node  include xmlns xlink in svg definition  stop using deprecated new buffer api drop support for node   removed dependency on gulp util to support gulp  copy preserveaspectratio attribute from source svg to to symbol  removed cache of the cheerio object  correctly set namespaces of the combined svg skip null and invalid files updated readme with a way to ensure unique ids updated direct dependencies removed cheerio from devdependencies  removed prefix and filename options ensure unique file names improved readme with gulp rename usage to generate id for nested directories added cheerio to devdependencies made cheerio  a peer dependency allows to choose what version to use uses file cheerio if cached in gulp file object and also sets it for the combined svg improved readme used cheerio instead of libxmljs changes transformsvg syntax added check for inputs before generating svg added check for missing viewbox

76983255, loginkit is a quick and easy way to add facebook and email login and signup ui to your app if you need to quickly prototype an app create an mvp or finish an app for a hackathon loginkit can help you by letting you focus on what makes your app special and leave login and signup to loginkit but if what you really want is a really specific and customized login and singup flow you are probably better off creating it on your own loginkit handles signup login via facebook email it takes care of the ui the forms validation and facebook sdk access all you need to do is start loginkit and then make the necessary calls to your own backend api to login or signup this is a simple example of how your login can look check out the example project to see how this was done and tinker around with it this other example is loginkit in use in one of our client apps ability to use loginviewcontroller  signupviewcontroller and passwordviewcontroller on it s own without having to use the logincoordinator ability to hide login signup and facebook buttons in initial screen added ability to remove background gradient added ability to remove animation when starting the login coordinator fixed an issue with the keyboard mover not working in some cases fixes and improvements to the sample project updated facebook sdk to latest version it simply add the following line to your podfile pod illoginkit everything is handled through the logincoordinator class you instantiate it and pass the root view controller which is the uiviewcontroller from which the loginkit process will be started presented on this will usually be self import loginkit class viewcontroller uiviewcontroller lazy var logincoordinator logincoordinator return logincoordinator rootviewcontroller self func showlogin logincoordinator start afterwards call start on the coordinator that s it of course you will want to customize the login coordinator to be able to supply your own ui personalization and to perform the necessary actions on login or signup that is done by subclassing the logincoordinator class class logincoordinator illoginkit logincoordinator handle anything you want to happen when loginkit starts make sure to call super override func start animated bool true super start animated animated configureappearance you can set any of these properties on the configuration property of the superclass to change the way loginkit looks besides the images all other properties have defaults no need to set them if you don t need them and property and effect and and and and and backgroundimage and the background image that will be used in all viewcontroller s and and backgroundimagegradient and set to false to remove the gradient from the background image default is true and and mainlogoimage and a logo image that will be used in the initial viewcontroller and and secondarylogoimage and a smaller logo image that will be used on all viewcontroller s except the initial one and and tintcolor and the tint color for the button text and background color and and errortintcolor and the tint color for error texts and and loginbuttontext and the text for the login button and and signupbuttontext and the text for the signup button and and facebookbuttontext and the text for the facebook button and and forgotpasswordbuttontext and the text for the forgot password button and and recoverpasswordbuttontext and the text for the recover password button and and nameplaceholder and the placeholder that will be used in the name text field and and emailplaceholder and the placeholder that will be used in the email text field and and passwordplaceholder and the placeholder that will be used in the password text field and and repeatpasswordplaceholder and the placeholder that will be used in the repeat password text field and and shouldshowsignupbutton and to hide the signup button set to false default is true and and shouldshowloginbutton and to hide the login button set to false default is true and and shouldshowfacebookbutton and to hide the facebook button set to false default is true and and shouldshowforgotpassword and to hide the forgot password button set to false default is true and and and customize loginkit all properties have defaults only set the ones you want func configureappearance and and customize the look with background logo images configuration backgroundimage configuration mainlogoimage configuration secondarylogoimage and and change colors configuration tintcolor uicolor red   and   green   and   blue   and   alpha  configuration errortintcolor uicolor red   and   green   and   blue   and   alpha  and and change placeholder button texts useful for different marketing style or language configuration loginbuttontext sign in configuration signupbuttontext create account configuration facebookbuttontext login with facebook configuration forgotpasswordbuttontext forgot password configuration recoverpasswordbuttontext recover configuration nameplaceholder name configuration emailplaceholder e mail configuration passwordplaceholder password configuration repeatpasswordplaceholder confirm password you can also create your own type that conforms to the configurationsource protocol or use the defaultconfiguration struct then just set it on the configuration object like so configuration defaultconfiguration backgroundimage signupbuttontext create account  loginbuttontext sign in  facebookbuttontext login with facebook  forgotpasswordbuttontext forgot password  recoverpasswordbuttontext recover  emailplaceholder e mail  passwordplaceholder password  repeatpasswordplaceholder confirm password  nameplaceholder name  shouldshowsignupbutton false shouldshowloginbutton true shouldshowfacebookbutton false shouldshowforgotpassword true x override these other  callback methods to handle what happens after the user tries to login signup recover password or enter with facebook here you would call your own api and and handle login via your api override func login email string password string print login with email email password password and and handle signup via your api override func signup name string email string password string print signup with name name email email password password and and handle facebook login and signup via your api override func enterwithfacebook profile facebookprofile print login and signup via facebook with fb profile profile and and handle password recovery via your api override func recoverpassword email string print recover password with email email after successfull login call the finish method on logincoordinator be sure to call super override func finish animated bool true super finish animated animated the final result would look something like this import foundation import illoginkit class logincoordinator illoginkit logincoordinator and and mark logincoordinator override func start animated bool true super start animated animated configureappearance override func finish animated bool true super finish animated animated and and mark setup and and customize loginkit all properties have defaults only set the ones you want func configureappearance and and customize the look with background logo images configuration backgroundimage imageliteral resourcename background

string print signup with name name email email password password and and handle facebook login and signup via your api override func enterwithfacebook profile facebookprofile print login and signup via facebook with fb profile profile and and handle password recovery via your api override func recoverpassword email string print recover password with email email if you only need to use the loginviewcontroller or signupviewcontroller or passwordviewcontroller on it s own without using the logincoordinator now you can just subclass any of them and set configuration property in the viewdidload method before calling super viewdidload class overridenloginviewcontroller loginviewcontroller override func viewdidload configuration settings defaultloginconfig and and configure before calling super super viewdidload override func didreceivememorywarning super didreceivememorywarning then just present the viewcontroller and set the delegate property to receive the appropiate

19601606, a clojurescript library of general purpose tools for building applications with leiningen dependency clojars this library does not currently have an active maintainer if you are interested in becoming one please post an issue om tools aims to provide higher order abstractions and utilities frequently useful when building components with om s api dom tools dom tools components tools component tools defcomponent defcomponent defcomponentk defcomponentk defcomponentmethod defcomponentmethod mixin tools mixin tools om tools dom mirrors the om dom namespace while using macros and minimal runtime overhead to make the following improvements element attributes are not required to be javascript values and are optional you don t need to use the js reader macro or nil for no attributes more natural attribute names we translate attributes like class to classname and on click to onclick to stay consistent with clojure naming conventions children can be in collections you don t need to use apply if you have a sequence of children or use concat for combining sequences of siblings example by comparison first with om dom clojure ns example require om dom as dom include macros true apply dom and ul js classname a list for i range  dom and li js style js color red str item i and with om tools dom clojure ns example require om tools dom as dom include macros true dom and ul class a list for i range  dom and li style color red str item i the om tools core and defcomponent macro defines om component constructor functions advantages over the ordinary defn reify approach removes boilerplate code around using reify to instantiate objects with om lifecycle methods component definitions become much smaller and easier to read adds schema schema support to specify and validate the data when component is built one of react s most which allows a component s author to document and validate which properties a component requires and their types this functionality is not utilized in om because we use normal clojurescript data structures as component inputs however with more complex input structures documentation and validation are even more important schema annotations are optional and validation is disabled by default automatically implements idisplayname for better debugging messages example of defcomponent including schema annotation clojure ns example require om tools core refer macros defcomponent om tools dom include macros true defcomponent counter data init js and number owner will mount  om and set state owner n init data render state  keys n dom and div dom and span str count n dom and button on click om and set state owner n inc n and dom and button on click om and set state owner n dec n  om and root counter init  target js and document body the om tools core and defcomponentk macro is similar to defcomponent  except that it uses plumbing plumbing s fnk destructuring syntax for constructor arguments this enables succinct and declaritive definition of the structure and requirements of component input data it also provides additional useful utilities mentioned in component inputs component inputs the args vector of defcomponentk uses that s optimized for destructuring nested maps with keyword keys it is the similar pattern used in our expressively declare http handlers if you are unfamiliar with this syntax here are some quick comparisons to default clojure map destructuring clojure keys foo bar foo bar keys foo bar as m foo bar as m keys foo bar or bar  foo bar  keys baz qux foo keys bar foo baz qux bar however an important distinction between clojure s default destructuring and fnk style is that specified keys are required by rather than defaulting to nil  if a key that s destructured is missing and no default value is specified an error is thrown by being explicit about component inputs we are less error prone and debugging is often easier because errors happen closer to the source the map that s passed to defcomponentk arg vector has the following and key and description and and and data and the data cursor passed to component when built and owner and the backing react component and opts and the optional map of options passed when built and shared and the map of globally shared data from om core and get shared and state and an atom like object for convenience to om core and get state and om core and set state clojure ns example require om core as om om tools core refer macros defcomponentk schema core refer macros defschema defschema progressbar value js and number s and optional key min js and number s and optional key max js and number defcomponentk progress bar a simple progress bar data value min  max  progressbar owner render  dom and div class progress bar dom and span style width and value max min  int str clojure om and root progress bar value  target js and document getelementbyid app throws error key value not found in wrong data om and root progress bar wrong data true target js and document getelementbyid app throws error value does not match schema schema core and with fn validation om and root progress bar value  target js and document getelementbyid app a component using defcomponentk can use the key state  to access an atom like object that conveniently wraps om core and get state and om core and set state so that we can read and write state idiomatically with deref  reset and swap clojure defcomponentk progress bar a simple progress bar data value min  max  state render  dom and div class progress bar dom and span style width and value max min  int str on mouse enter swap state assoc show value true on mouse leave swap state assoc show value false when show value state str value and total it s important to note that while state looks and behaves like an atom  there is at least one minor difference changes made by swap and reset are not immediately available if you deref in the same render phase instead of normal functions to create polymorphic components requires om version    and the defcomponentmethod macro allows you to register components into a multimethod created from cljs core and defmulti  while using the normal om tools syntax clojure defmulti fruit basket item fn fruit owner type fruit defcomponentmethod fruit basket item orange orange owner render  dom and label orange defcomponentmethod fruit basket item banana banana owner render  dom and label class when peeled banana peeled banana defcomponentmethod fruit basket item default fruit owner render  dom and label str unknown fruit name type fruit om and build all fruit basket item type banana type pineapple type orange react provides mixin functionality react mixin to handle cross cutting concerns and allow highly reusable component behaviors while mixins are possible with om om mixin  it does not provide much functionality to support this react feature one issue is that you must create a react constructor and specify it each time the component is built this puts the responsibility of using mixins on both the component create a constructor and its parent specify the constructor another issue is having to drop down to raw javascript functions breaking you out of om s data and state abstractions om tools provides a defmixin macro in the om tools mixin namespace to define mixins the syntax of defmixin follows same pattern as the component macros one last thing the factory functions created by defcomponent and defcomponentk ie component name data encapsulate any custom constructor automatically so a parent component no longer needs to be aware when a child uses mixins here s how you could reimplement react s mixin example react mixin clojure ns example require om tools core refer macros defcomponentk om tools dom as dom include macros true om tools mixin refer macros defmixin defmixin set interval mixin will mount owner set owner intervals js will unmount owner owner intervals map js and clearinterval set interval owner f t owner intervals push js and setinterval f t defcomponentk tick tock owner state mixins set interval mixin init state  seconds  did mount  set interval owner swap state update in seconds inc  render

simple steps it could all be done in your front controller e g public and index php in phalcon generally it makes sense to initialize the profiler as soon as possible to measure as much execution time as you can you should initialize the profiler in your front controller or the bootstrap file right after requiring the composer autoloader profiler new fabfuel prophiler profiler to visualize the profiling results you have to initialize and render the prophiler toolbar this component takes care for rendering all results of the profiler benchmarks and other data collectors put that at the end of the front controller you can also add other data collectors to the toolbar to show e g request data like in this example toolbar new fabfuel prophiler toolbar profiler toolbar adddatacollector new fabfuel prophiler datacollector request echo toolbar render you can also easily create you own data collectors by implementing the datacollectorinterface and adding an instance to the toolbar toolbar

possible to run overlapping benchmarks profiler start my class dosomeotherthing  additional information  my component profiler stop prophiler now features benchmark aggregations these give you a lot more insights and are extremely useful to quickly see the total number of recurring executions e g database or cache queries analyze minimum maximum and average execution times of recurring executions easily see e g accidentally recurring executions of the same database query get a warning if the total number of executions exceeds a custom threshold get a warning if the maximum execution time exceeds a custom threshold prophiler comes with some aggregators but you can easily create your own to set up an aggregator all you need to do is to register the aggregator at the profiler instance

database and cache queries grouped by command and query including the total number of executions the total duration of all executions as well as the minimum maximum and average execution time you can use prophiler to log events and other data and view it in the timeline and in the separate logs tab if you already have a logging infrastructure you can add the psr  compliant logger adapter to it otherwise you can also just instantiate and use it directly logger new fabfuel prophiler adapter psr log logger profiler logger warning this is a warning  some context logger debug some debugging

1532873, treehugger js  treehugger js is a javascript library for program processing it has generic means to represent and manipulate analyze transform it consists of three parts that can be used to represent programs written in any language java ruby javascript lib and treehugger and tree js a set of generic traversals to query manipulate and annotate these asts lib and treehugger and traverse js a set of analyses for specific languages currently and analyses reconstructing the type structure and first attempts at type inference lib and treehugger and js and js ast representation  ast js uses a few simple data structures to represent asts and a textual representation that makes it easy to debug and write these asts the textual representation is best introduced by example consider a simple expresion language with expression as follows  and   a parser could turn this into the following ast add and num mul and and  num num and and   which is expressed using treehugger js s textual representation as follows add num   mul num   num  using the treehugger js api this ast can be contructed as follows var tree require treehugger and tree var node tree cons add  tree cons num  tree string   tree cons mul  tree cons num  tree string   tree cons num  tree string  or more simply var node tree parse add num   mul num   num  treehugger js has three kinds of ast node types strings e g   myvariable  usually representing identifiers or other textual values lists e g a  b  none constructors or simply cons nodes e g none or num   used to represent language constructs in the language such as operators loop constructs etc ast analysis  treehugger js is based on the concept of generic traversals a generic traversal traverses the tree in a particular order for instance from top to bottom or from the bottom up at every node the traversal comes across you can apply one or transformations tranformations can either be ast patterns transformation functions or a combination of both the treehugger and traverse js library adds a number of methods to ast nodes that make traversals simpler collecttopdown traverses the tree top to bottom until finding a match collecting all matches and returning them as a list traversetopdown traverses the tree top to bottom until finding a match more are coming a transformation can be either a textual ast pattern a textual ast pattern followed by a transformation function that is passed a binding object a transformation function each transform either matches or doesn t match if a transformation function matches it returns a non falsy value usually a new ast node  if it doesn t it returns false a simple example var node tree parse add num   mul num   num  node collecttopdown num  debug this will traverse the ast and look for nodes that match the num  pattern where  a wildcard can be anything the collecttopdown traversal traverses the ast from top to bottom and on the way collects all matches and returns them as an listnode the result of the collecttopdown call in this case will be num   num   num  the debug call prints the result to the javascript console console log so what if we want to only return the numbers not the num constructors if we follow a textual pattern by a function we can transform the result var node tree parse add num   mul num   num  node collecttopdown num n  function b return b n debug instead of using the placeholder   we now used n the function is passed a bindings object whose n property will contain the value of the placeholder so the following will be printed to the javascript console      if we want to match either num or mul nodes we can add a pattern for that to the collecttopdown call var node tree parse add num   mul num   num  node collecttopdown num n  function b return b n  mul op op  function b return b op debug this will print   num  why is that the ast is traversed top to bottom by collecttopdown on its way it will try to match every node first against the num n pattern if that succeeds the function after it in the argument list is executed if the function returns a value other than false  the traversal stops at that branch and the result is added to the result list if the num n pattern did not match it is matched against mul op op again if this pattern matches the function is executed etc etc the collecttopdown traversal will not traverse down to the num  and num  nodes because the traversal stopped when matching the mul  node if instead the tranformation function would have returned false the traversal would have proceeded down those nodes as well license

3752629, server side rendering library for react router v if anyone is interested in taking over this project please let me know  about about  installation installation  examples examples  usage usage  api api  contributing contributing  license license this library allows to fetch states for your components on the server side and mount them on the client side it also allows to do code splitting by providing a component that can be used to load modules splitted by webpack  npm install react router server save a working example using webpack bundle and preloading is to try for yourself you can clone it and run it this will provide a server accessible at git clone git github com gabrielbull and react router server complex example git npm install npm start to render an app that has code splitting or state fetching you need to load the modules and states required by your app before rendering react dom and server does not offer a function to do that but you can use the rendertostring function provided by this library this function will return a promise that will return the rendered app once the modules and states are loaded import rendertostring from react router server import app from and path and to and app then html and and send html to client side the code splitting consist of a component that you can use to load modules splitted by webpack  it also allows you to get information on the modules required to render a page so that you can preload the modules before displaying the page on the client side to use code splitting you will need to import the module component and provide the system import call inside the module property of that component then you need to defined a callback function as the children of the component import  module from react router server module module  system import and foo and module to preload the modules on the client side you can use the preload method and pass the modules from the server into that method in the following example initialmodules would be provided by the server and rendered in the html document as a global variable import preload from react router server import render from react dom import app from and path and to and app you can get the modules from the rendertostring function on the server side and extract them from your webpack stats by using the extractmodules method for more information on usage with webpack check the usage with webpack webpack usage part of this read me import rendertostring extractmodules from react router server import app from and path and to and app import stats from and path and to and stats then html modules modules extractmodules modules stats and and send html and modules to client side on the server side you will often need to fetch data before rendering your component and then pass that data to the client side so that the components are in sync to fetch data for your components use the fetchstate decorator provided by this library the fetchstate decorator takes two arguments mapstatetoprops and mapactionstoprops mapstatetoprops allows you to map the state to the props of your component while mapactionstoprops allows you to map the done action to the props of your component import as react from react import fetchstate from react router server fetchstate state message state message  actions done actions done class mycomponent extends react component componentwillmount if this props message settimeout this props done message hello world   render return to pass that state from the server to the client you need to wrap the client app with the serverstateprovider and pass the state from the server into that component s state property in the following example initialstate would be provided by the server and rendered in the html document as a global variable import serverstateprovider from react router server import app from and path and to and app serverstateprovider state initialstate and serverstateprovider you can get the state from the rendertostring function on the server side import rendertostring from react router server import app from and path and to and app then html state and and send html and state to client side you can extract the required modules per requests when running your server to pass them to the client side this allows you to preload your modules before running the client side app to do so you need to get the here s a code sample that you can add to your webpack config s plugins section this will create a stats json file that you can use to extract the required modules for your app new statsplugin stats json  chunkmodules true exclude and nodemodules and to extract the modules you can use the extractmodules function and pass the modules provided by the rendertostring as well as the stats generated by webpack see the code splitting usage code splitting part of this documentation to learn more on code splitting to use with react router v you can pass the module component to the route component of react router import route from react router import  module from react router server path and render matchprops module module system import and foo and module if you are rehydrating state with redux instead of using serverstateprovider  all you need is access to the done action so the server can wait for async stuff to complete in that case you can use the withdone decorator which is a shorthand for fetchstate null done done import as react from react import connect from react redux import withdone from react router server import setmessage from and actions withdone connect state state message setmessage class mycomponent extends react component componentwillmount and and using async actions const setmessage done this props setmessage hello world then done done render return extractmodules modules stats modules modules provided by the rendertostring method stats stats generated by webpack fetchstate mapstatetoprops mapactionstoprops mapstatetoprops state  function to map the state provided by the done action to props in your component mapactionstoprops actions  function to map the actions to props in your component currently only the done action exists and is used when you are finished fetching props shorthand for fetchstate null done done the module component allows to do code splitting the module component takes these propeties module a function that returns a system import call e g  system import and foo preload modules modules array of modules passed by the server side to the client side for preloading async version of reactdom rendertostring rendertostring element element the element to render returns an object html state modules with html the rendered html state the app state provided by fetch state modules the app modules provided by code splitting the serverstateprovider component is used for providing the server state to the client side provided by the state prop everyone is welcome to contribute and add more

60732356, this is a library that will produce a best guess examples of in memory data the inferred spec is not meant to be used as is and without human intervention it is rather a starting point that can and should be refined the idea is analogous to f type providers specifically the json type provider but the input in the case of spec provider is any in memory clojure data structure since clojure spec is still in alpha this library should also be considered to be in alpha so highly experimental very likely to change possibly flawed this library works in both clojure and clojurescript maturity level mature and useful has not reached full potential as some ideas are still unexplored to use this library add this dependency to your leiningen project clj file spec provider    the are two main use cases for spec provider  you have a lot of examples of raw data maybe in a jsonb column of a postresql table and you d like to see a summary of what shape the data is you can use spec provider as a way to explore new datasets you already know what shape your data is and you just want some help getting started writing a spec for it because your data is deeply nested has a lot of corner cases you re lazy etc you think you know what shape your data is but because it s neither typed checked nor contract checked some exceptions have sneaked into it instead of eyeballing  maps you run spec provider on them and to your surprise you find that one of the fields is s and or integer integer string string instead of just string as you expected you can use spec provider as a data debugging tool  you have an un spec ed function and you also have a good way to exercise it via unit tests actual usage etc you can instrument the function with spec provider run it a few times with actual data and then ask spec provider for the function spec based on the data that flowed through the function to infer a spec of a bunch of data just pass the data to the infer specs function clojure require spec provider provider as sp def inferred specs sp and infer specs a  b foo c k a  b bar c k a  b baz c k toy and small map inferred specs clojure spec alpha and def toy and c clojure spec and or keyword keyword string string clojure spec alpha and def toy and b string clojure spec alpha and def toy and a integer clojure spec alpha and def toy and small map clojure spec and keys req un toy and a toy and b toy and c the sequence of specs that you get out of infer spec is technically correct but not very useful for pasting into your code luckily you clojure sp and pprint specs inferred specs toy s s and def c s and or keyword keyword string string s and def b string s and def a integer s and def small map s and keys req un a b c passing toy to pprint specs signals that we intend to paste this code into the toy namespace so spec names are printed using the syntax passing s signals that we are going to require clojure spec as s  so the calls to clojure spec and def become s and def etc spec provider will walk nested data structures in your sample data and attempt to infer specs for everything let s use clojure spec to generate a larger sample of data with nested structures clojure s and def id s and or numeric pos int string string s and def codes s and coll of keyword max gen  s and def first name string s and def surname string s and def k nilable keyword s and def age s and with gen s and and integer pos  gen and int  s and def person and role programmer designer s and def phone number string s and def street string s and def city string s and def country string s and def street number pos int s and def address s and keys req un street city country opt un street number s and def person s and keys req un id first name surname k age address opt un phone number codes req person and role this spec can be used to generate a reasonably large random sample of clojure def persons gen and sample s and gen person  which generates structures like clojure id dfmch  first name   surname hafsa  k a dz and a person and role designer address street yrxudy  city b  country wnq  street number   mo j b n  a and igue coe sl mhn  x axztfh x and da and zu tur evd rd kq wy f o and o and qg and bh a t f now watch what happens when we infer the spec of persons clojure sp and pprint specs sp and infer specs persons person and person person s s and def codes s and coll of keyword s and def phone number string s and def street number integer s and def country string s and def city string s and def street string address s and keys req un street city country opt un street number s and def age integer s and def k s and nilable keyword s and def surname string s and def first name string s and def id s and or string string integer integer s and def role programmer designer person req role req un id first name surname k age address opt un phone number codes which is very close to the original spec we are going to break down this result to bring attention to specific features in the following sections if the sample data contain any nil values this is detected and reflected in the inferred spec clojure s and def k s and nilable keyword things like street number  codes and phone number did not appear consistently in the sampled data so they are correctly identified as optional in the inferred spec clojure address s and keys req un street city country opt un street number most of the keys in the sample data are not qualified and they are detected as such in the inferred spec the person and role key is identified as fully qualified clojure person req role req un id first name surname k age address opt un phone number codes note that the s and def for role is pretty printed as role because when calling pprint specs we indicated that we are going to paste this into the person namespace clojure sp and pprint specs sp and infer specs persons person and person person s s and def role programmer designer you may have also noticed that role has been identified as an enumeration of programmer and designer to see how it s decided whether a field is an enumeration or not we have to look under the hood let s generate a small sample of roles clojure gen and sample s and gen role  designer designer designer designer programmer spec provider collects statistics about all the sample data before deciding on the spec clojure require spec provider stats as stats stats and collect stats gen and sample s and gen role  sample count  pred map function clojure core and keyword spec provider stats sample count  the stats include a set of distinct values observed up to a certain limit  the sample count for each field and counts on each of the predicates that the field matches in this case just keyword based on these statistics the spec is inferred and a decision is made on whether the value is an enumeration or not if the following statement is true then the value is considered an enumeration clojure and count distinct values sample count in other words if the number of distinct values found is less that  of the total recorded values then the value is an enumeration this threshold is configurable looking at the actual numbers can make this logic easier to understand for the small sample above clojure sp and infer specs gen and sample s and gen role  role clojure spec and def spec provider person spec and role keyword we have  distinct values in a sample of  which is  of the values being distinct imagine this percentage in a larger sample say distinct  values in a sample of size  that doesn t sound likely to be an enumeration so it s interpreted as a normal value if you increase the sample clojure sp and infer specs gen and sample s and gen role  role clojure spec and def spec provider person spec and role programmer designer we have  distinct values in a sample of  which is   which means that the same values appear again and again in the sample so it must be an enumeration clojure spec makes the same assumption as clojure spec that keys that have same name also have the same data shape as their value even when they appear in different maps this means that the specs from different maps are merged by key to demonstrate this we need to spike the generated persons with an id field that s inconsistent with the existing s and or numeric pos int string string clojure defn add inconsistent id person if address person assoc in person address id gen and generate gen and keyword person def persons spiked map add inconsistent id gen and sample s and gen person  inferring the spec of persons spiked yields a different result for clojure sp and pprint specs sp and infer specs persons spiked person and person person s s and def id s and or string string integer integer keyword keyword this feature is not illustrated by the person example but before returning them spec provider will walk the inferred specs and look for forms that already occur elsewhere and replace them with the name of the known spec for example clojure sp and pprint specs sp and infer specs a zz  b zz  a zz  zz  nil b nil foo ns s s and def zz integer s and def b s and nilable s and keys req un zz s and def a s and coll of b s and def foo s and keys req un a b in this case because maps like zz  appear under the key b  spec provider knows what to call them so it uses that name for s and def a s and coll of b this replacement is not performed if the spec definition is a predicate from the clojure core namespace spec provider collects stats about the min and max values of numerical fields but will not output them in the inferred spec by default to get range predicates in your specs you have to pass the spec provider provider and range option clojure require spec provider provider refer all as sp pprint specs infer specs foo  bar  foo  bar  foo  bar  stuff sp and range true ns s s and def bar s and and integer fn x  x  s and def foo s and and integer fn x  x  s and def stuff s and keys req un bar foo you can also restrict range predicates to specific keys by passing a set of qualified keys that are the names of the specs that should get a range predicate clojure sp and pprint specs sp and infer specs foo  bar  foo  bar  foo  bar  stuff sp and range foo ns s s and def bar integer s and def foo s and and integer fn x  x  s and def stuff s and keys req un bar foo inferring a spec from raw data is a two step process stats collection and then summarization of the stats into specs first each data structure is visited recursively and statistics are collected at each level about the types of values that appear the distinct values for each field up to a limit  min and max values for numbers lengths for sequences etc two important points about stats collection spec provider will not run out of memory even if you throw a lot of data at it because it updates the same statistics data structure with every new example datum it receives collecting stats will at least partly realize lazy sequences after stats collection code from the spec provider provider namespace goes through the stats and it summarizes it as a collection of specs as mentioned in the previous section spec provider first collects statistics about the data that you pass to it and then it uses them to infer specs for this data the entry point for collecting stats is the spec provider stats and collect function this can be used to explore your data and give you insight about its structure as it was very nicely explained in dan lebrero assume this clojure require spec provider provider as sp spec provider stats as stats there is only one option that affects how the specs are inferred and it can be passed as a map in an extra parameter to sp and infer specs sp and range if true all numerical specs include a range predicate if it s a set of spec names qualified keywords  only these specs will include range predicates see section inferring specs with numerical ranges inferring specs with numerical ranges for an example default false there is a number of options that can affect how the sample stats are collected and consequently also affect what spec is inferred these options are passed to stats and collect  or as part of the options map passed to sp and infer specs stats and distinct limit how many distinct values are collected for collections default  stats and coll limit how many elements of the collection are used to infer and collect data about the type of the contained element default  this means that lazy sequences are at least partly realized stats and positional results in positional stats being collected for sequences so that s and cat can be inferred instead of s and coll of default false stats and positional limit bounds the positional stats length default  undocumented and under development there is experimental support for instrumenting functions for the purpose of inferring the spec of args and return values there is no attempt to infer the regular expression of collections there is no attempt to infer tuples there is no attempt to infer multi spec for functions only the args and ret parts of the spec is generated the fn part is up to you spec provider assumes that you want to follow the clojure spec convention that the same map keys identify the same entity  so it will merge stats that appear under the identical keys but in different parts of your tree structure this may not be what you want for more details see the merging section will i run out of memory if i pass a lot of examples of my data to infer specs no stats collection works by updating the same data structure with every example of data received the data structure will initially grow a bit and then maintain a constant size that means that you can use a lazy sequence to stream your huge table through it if you feel that s necessary not tested can i do this for prismatic schema the hard part of inferring a spec is collecting the statistics summarizing the stats as specs was relatively easy so plugging in a different summarizer that will output schemas from the same stats should be possible look at the provider namespace write the schema equivalent and send me a

99983972, vkdoom adds a vulkan renderer to the gpl doom  bfg edition it was written as an example of how to use vulkan for writing something more sizable than simple recipes it covers topics such as general setup proper memory resource allocation synchronization pipelines etc note this is an unofficial release note for those just wanting to dive straight into the vulkan code you can find it here neo and renderer and vulkan also you can just search for idvulkan as of initial release all maps load and are playable however the code base is not in complete parity with the opengl renderer here are some notes on what is still left to do or address anything using accum is broken some swf masks will render black in a few places render debug functionality is largely missing compare renderdebuggl to renderdebugvk screenshots aren t implemented atm the window will resize and go from windowed fullscreen properly but not all swapchain invalidation cases are handled some cvars from pure bfg may not function as expected prerequisites start git bash and clone the vkdoom repo open the visual studio solution neo doom sln  select the desired configuration and platform then build the solution gl

48668276, a quick way to prototype and build apps with react and babel with zero setup setting up the tooling required to work on a modern day web app is hard and makes quick prototyping much more difficult than it should be quik is a quick way to prototype a react application without any kind of setup it can also generate a production ready javascript bundle to use in your app no setup required quik runs a simple server that compiles javascript files with babel on the fly so you can include esx files in a script tag directly tip  you can add transpile false to the script src to skip the transpilation quik also exposes a koa middleware which can be easily integrated with your server one time installation no additional setup required hot module replacement generates bundles for use in production generates single standalone html file for sharing react redux react router and radium are already included quick prototyping with an optional starter template you need at least node   to run quik npm install global quik open the terminal in any directory and run the following it ll start a simple server which will serve the files in the current directory by default it ll automatically watch the file index js if present if no index html file is present it ll generate and serve an html file with it s script tag pointing to index js file alternatively you can specify the name of the script to include quik run script js if you want to use a different port for example to run the server in the port   run quik port  you can include any es file in a script tag in an html file and the script will be transpiled to es on the fly you can use jsx and flow syntax as well as use es modules to import other scripts it just works note you ll need to install any dependencies you use in the project manually hot module replacement for react components is automatically enabled if you have a script named index js in the directory or if you specified a script to run with the run option for example quik run app js alternatively you can specify the filenames you want to watch for hmr quik watch file js file js when using the run option the index html file is always generated on the fly and served if you want to use your own index html file just use watch you only need to specify the entry points not all scripts most of the time it ll be just one script note that hot module replacement won t work for any components in the entry points the bundler provides an abstraction on top of webpack with sensible defaults for a react project if you need additional customisation use webpack directly for bundling to generate a bundle wth quik for use in your web application run the following in a terminal quik bundle entry js output bundle js production the production option performs minification on the resulting bundle you can omit it if you re not going to use the file in production you can provide multiple entry points as arguments in that case you can use name to get the name of the entry point while specifying an output file quik bundle file js file js output name bundle js common common bundle js sourcemap files are automatically generated when generating bundles sometimes you might want compile and inject bundles into an html file for easier sharing through dropbox email etc to do so run the following in a terminal quik html output output html production you can also specify an html file which quik will parse for any local scripts then it will build them and inject into the html file it ll also inline stylesheets as is without any pre processing just open the generated html file in any browser to preview quik html index html output output html for example to use firefox as the browser you d do quik browser firefox to get started with a sample project run the following in a terminal quik init awesomeproject cd awesomeproject quik refer the api documentation api md for more to know how to customize and extend the server the quik middleware is just an abstraction on top of webpack it includes a base webpack config and generates appropriate config files when needed for example when the quik server receives a request for a javascript file it generates a webpack config on the fly the file is then transpiled with webpack  and the server responds with the generated bundle instead of the original script tooling is the hardest part in javascript development and it s time we do something about it the following posts inspired me to work on quik  one good thing about quik is that it is highly opinionated which means we don t worry about becoming generic and can focus on making it better at what it does it doesn t allow additional babel transforms or loaders for webpack as of now inline styles are recommended for styling when combined with a library like radium  they provide much more flexibility than css the goal of quik is to improve the tooling around react and babel projects while it ll be easy enough to support additional customization it defeats the whole purpose of being zero setup if you need additional configuration it will be better to go with webpack directly if you think something should be included by default send a pull request or file a bug report even though quik itself doesn t provide additional customization it s just a koa middleware at the core that means it s composable with other koa middlewares and you can add additional functionality easily below are some ideas on how to improve quik it would be awesome to receive pull requests for these automatically parse html files to enable hot reloading without having to specify files with watch cache bundles instead of re building on every request better error handling atom plugin to make it easier to use without cli of course quik is not the only tool trying to solve this problem there are few other tools which are also doing a great job at it

65025965, btlejuice framework  introduction  btlejuice is a complete framework to perform man in the middle attacks on bluetooth smart devices also known as bluetooth low energy it is composed of an interception core an interception proxy a dedicated web interface python and node js bindings how to install btlejuice  installing btlejuice is a child s play first of all make sure your system uses a recent version of node js    and npm then make sure to install all the required dependencies sudo apt get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth dev libudev dev sudo yum install bluez bluez libs bluez libs devel npm last install btlejuice using npm sudo npm install g btlejuice if everything went well btlejuice is ready to use how to use btlejuice  btlejuice is composed of two main components an interception proxy and a core these two components are required to run on independent machines in order to operate simultaneously two bluetooth   and adapters btlejuice proxy does not work in a docker container the use of a virtual machine may help to make this framework work on a single computer from your virtual machine install btlejuice and make sure your usb bt adapter is available from the virtual machine sudo hciconfig hci type br and edr bus usb bd address   b   ad acl mtu   sco mtu   rx bytes  acl  sco  events  errors  tx bytes  acl  sco  commands  errors  sudo hciconfig hci up then make sure your virtual machine has an ip address reachable from the host launch the proxy in your virtual machine sudo btlejuice proxy on your host machine don t forget to stop the bluetooth service and ensure the hci device remains opened and initialized sudo service bluetooth stop sudo hciconfig hci up finally run the following command on your host machine sudo btlejuice u proxy ip address w the w flag tells btlejuice to start the web interface while the u option specifies the proxy s ip address using the web interface  the btlejuice s web interface provides in the top right corner a set of links to control the interception core as shown below btlejuice main web ui doc and images and btlejuice main ui png first click the select target button and a dialog will show up displaying all the available bluetooth low energy devices detected by the interception core btlejuice target selection popup doc and images and btlejuice target select png double click on the desired target and wait for the interface to be ready the bluetooth button s aspect will change once the dummy device ready use the associated mobile application or another device depending on what is expected to connect to the dummy device if the connection succeeds a connected event would be shown on the main interface btlejuice target selection popup doc and images and btlejuice sniffing png all the intercepted gatt operations are then displayed with the corresponding services and characteristics uuid and of course the data associated with them the data is shown by default with the hexii format a variant of the format designed by ange albertini  but you may want to switch from hexii to hex and back by clicking on the data itself both hex and hexii format are supported by btlejuice it is possible to replay any gatt operation by right clicking it and then selecting the replay option as shown below replay popup doc and images and btlejuice hook png replay dialog doc and images and btlejuice replay png click the write or read button to replay the corresponding gatt operation this operation will be logged in the main interface last but not least the interface may intercept locally or globally any gatt operation and allow on the fly data modification you may either use the global interception by clicking the intercept button in the top right corner or use the contextual menu to enable or disable a hook on a given service and characteristic any time a gatt operation is intercepter the following dialog box will show up interceptr dialog doc and images and btlejuice intercept png since version    the interface provides a data export feature allowing readable and json exports these exports are generated based on the intercepted gatt operations but also include information about the target device when the export button is clicked the following dialog will show up export dialog doc and images and btlejuice export png click the export button at the bottom of the dialog box to download a json or text version of the intercepted data the settings dialog provides a single option at the moment allowing to automatically reconnect the proxy when the target device disconnects this may be useful when dealing with devices that are active during a short amount of time settings dialog doc and images and btlejuice settings png clicking the top right select target button when the proxy is active will stop it and allow target selection again installing the bindings  btlejuice s node js bindings may be installed as well through npm sudo npm install g btlejuice bindings copyright

120204184, just a messy edit of arc gtk theme  designed as a companion for my xfwm openbox and fluxbox theme collections so you can t find gnome shell metacity emerald cinnamon etc here contains a dark variant called fantome and a light variant called lumiere the gtk part mostly default the gtk css is too hard for me to be understood i use openbox for the light colour preview and fluxbox for my the dark colour preview the icons theme used is arc but i delete some components then set papirus as a fallback instaed of moka i also edit the folder icons using gimp to make it match with my colour scheme gtk csd is removed using gtk nocsd and the album in the playlist is six degrees of inner turbulence by dream theater i recommend you to listen to it simply just clone this repository to your and themes folder then apply your desired theme using lxappearance or xfce settings appearance failed to clone remove the git folder inside the and themes folder first panel frame is a bloat so i remove it combo entry is a bloat so i remove it but don t worry there will be an outline when it s selected scrollbar placeholder is a bloat so i remove it don t worry the scrollbar itself remains visible progressbar placeholder is a bloat so i remove it don t worry the progressbar itself remains visible tab button is a bloat so i replace it with simple underline for top and bottom tab and sideline for left and right tab multiple background colour is a bloat so i unify the colour ffffff for light theme and ff for dark theme button actually is a bloat previously i completely remove the button pixmap but it breaks my workflow especially when i deal with an app with so many buttons like gimp so now i made the button only visible as a thin outline for inactive button and slight highlight for active button gtk csd is the best example of bloat it breaks some compositing effect like multiple shadow wrong transparency and having hide maximize close buttons in tiling window manager which is ridiculous i recommend you to remove it using gtk nocsd            just like any dark theme sometimes it breaks web browsing experience and i don t know how to fix it i designed this theme for myself so i use it works for me philosophy don t complain if it doesn t work for you p folder icons are included as a bonus added noita vescita ocha and tee just like others they are a messy edit of arc gtk theme with some removal of component to make them look minimal and less distracting and gtk part only slightly modified because they are too hard for me to be understood i edited the arc gtk theme without a proper knowledge just using sporadic trials errors and reverts with inkscape gimp and geany gpl of course feel free to modify and share this theme
48518818, redux simplifies writing well structured  predictable  testable maintainable javascript web applications note this guide is aimed at people who already have intermediate javascript experience e g you have already built a couple of small apps without using a framework and and or have used an older more complex library such as angular ember backbone or flux if you are just starting out on your web programming journey we recommend you checkout first and then come back here bookmark and star this github repository so you don t forget where it is javascript web applications can become messy if they don t have a clear organisation from the beginning redux is an elegant way to structure your javascript web applications having built many web applications over the past few years using all the most popular frameworks and libraries we were delighted to discover redux s refreshingly simple approach while there is an initial learning curve we feel the simplicity of the single store snapshot of your app s state and applying changes to your app by dispatching succinct functional actions offers a significant benefit over other ways of organising your code please don t take our word for it skim through the notes we have made and always decide for yourself which simplifies writing web apps if you have never heard of elm  don t worry  you don t need to go read another doc before you can understand this just keep reading and hopefully everything will become clear if anything is unclear  please tell us where you are stuck so we can help  redux is based on three principals the state of your whole application is stored in a single object tree the store this makes it much easier to keep track of the state of your application at any time and roll back to any previous state if its not intermediately obvious why this is a good thing we urge you to have faith and keep reading instead of directly updating data in the store we describe the update as a function which gets applied to the existing store and returns a new version to change the state tree we use actions called reducers  these are simple functions which perform a single action read more about javascript s reduce array method and how to reduce an array of objects understanding these two things will help you grasp why redux is so simple you will see this abbreviated and codified as state action state i e takes all it s best ideas and features from elm so by learning the elm architecture  we wrote a complete beginner s step by step introduction if after you ve learned redux and built a couple of react apps you decide you want to discover where all the best ideas in the react ecosystem came from the fastest way to learn redux is to watch the the videos are broken down into bite size chunks which are easily digestible total viewing time for the videos is  minutes we have made a set of comprehensive notes and transcriptions on the videos these are in we recommend keeping the notes open in a distinct window and browser while you are watching the videos you can go a lot faster because all the sample code is included and if for any reason you do not understand what dan is saying you have the notes to refer to please give feedback and suggest improvements by creating issues on github thanks good history and insight into his motivations for learning to program and the journey that lead him to writing redux and redux simplifying application state in javascript and full stack redux tutorial redux react immutable js by if you are building a react based app to manage the routing of your client side app react router manages an important piece of your application state the url if you are using redux you want your app state to fully represent your ui if you snapshotted the app state you should be able to load it up later and see the same thing at the time of writing the minified version of redux is which is even smaller when gzipped short answer no  redux does not depend on or require you to use react the two are separate and can be learned and used independently longer answer while many redux apps and tutorials use react redux is totally separate from react dan s egghead video tutorials do feature react heavily from lesson  onwards considering that react is the fastest growing view dom rendering library of  and the pace of its adoption looks set to continue in  so it won t hurt you to know how to use react we ve made some notes to help you get started learning react you can and should use redux to organise your application and optionally use react to render your views short answer not yet longer answer the convention in redux apps is for the state to be this makes your app far more predictable because any and all changes to the state have to be done via an action makes the data structures in your application state more efficient in larger apps however while you are learning redux we suggest you ignore immutable js as you will have more than enough to master for now once you have published your first app using redux come back to immutable js to appreciate how it makes large apps run faster as lee byron the creator of immutable js states for small apps without much change in state  adding immutable js will actually make your app perform worse if you want to understand why using immutable js can be a good thing in large apps  watch and explain why unidirectional data flow is this better than bi directional e g angular js which he has painstakingly kept up to date with the latest redux and react versions enthusiasm and patience while explaining it all to us if you found our notes useful please share them with others by starring this repo and and or re tweeting

888359, potemkin is a collection of facades and workarounds for things that are more difficult than they should be all functions are within the potemkin namespace potemkin    clojure namespaces conflate the layout of your code and your api for larger libraries this generally means that you either have large namespaces e g clojure core or a large number of namespaces that have to be used in concert to accomplish non trivial tasks e g ring the former approach places an onus on the creator of the library the various orthogonal pieces of his library all coexist which can make it difficult to keep everything straight the latter approach places an onus on the consumers of the library forcing them to remember exactly what functionality resides where before they can actually use it import vars allows functions macros and values to be defined in one namespace and exposed in another this means that the structure of your code and the structure of your api can be decoupled import vars clojure walk prewalk postwalk clojure data diff a clojure map implements the following interfaces clojure lang ipersistentcollection  clojure lang ipersistentmap  clojure lang counted  clojure lang seqable  clojure lang ilookup  clojure lang associative  clojure lang iobj  java lang object  java util map  java util concurrent callable  java lang runnable  and clojure lang ifn between them there s a few dozen functions many with overlapping functionality all of which need to be correctly implemented despite this there are only six functions which really matter get  assoc  dissoc  keys  meta  and with meta def map type is a variant of deftype which if those six functions are implemented will look and act like a clojure map for instance here s a map which will automatically realize any delays allowing for lazy evaluation semantics def map type lazymap m mta get  k default value if contains m k let v get m k if instance clojure lang delay v v v default value assoc  k v lazymap assoc m k v mta dissoc  k lazymap dissoc m k mta keys  keys m meta  with meta  mta lazymap m mta often a map is just a view onto another object especially when dealing with java apis while we can create a function which converts it into an entirely separate object for both performance and memory reasons it can be useful to create a map which simply acts as a delegate to the underlying objects def derived map stringproperties string s base s lower case tolowercase s upper case touppercase s each time the key lower case is looked up it will invoke tolowercase the resulting datatype behaves exactly like a normal clojure map new keys can be added and derived keys can be removed however using def abstract type  we can avoid this def abstract type aseq more this let n next this if empty n  n this abstract type may be used within the body of deftype and  which is just like a vanilla deftype except for the support for abstract types deftype and customseq s clojure lang iseq seq  s cons  x customseq cons x s next  customseq next s while definterface uses an entirely different convention than defprotocol  definterface and uses the same convention and automatically defines inline able functions which call into the interface thus any protocol which doesn t require the extensibility can be trivially turned into an interface with all the inherent savings gensyms enforce hygiene within macros but when quote syntax is nested they can become a pain this for instance doesn t work let x  map fn n and x n range  because x is going to expand to a different gensym in the two different contexts one way to work around this is to explicitly create a gensym ourselves let x sym gensym x let x sym  map fn n and x sym n range  however this is pretty tedious since we may need to define quite a few of these explicit gensym names using unify gensyms  however we can rely on the convention that any var with two hashes at the end should be unified unify gensyms let x  map fn n and x n range  variants of clojure s bound fn and memoize which are significantly faster copyright   zachary tellman

2929281, vault is a simple password manager given a passphrase and the name of a service it returns a strong password for that service you only need to remember your passphrase which you do not give to anyone and vault will give a different password for every service you use the passphrase can be any text you like given the same passphrase and service name the program will generate the same result every time so you can use it to look up those impossible to remember passwords when you need them according to dropbox s zxcvbn password strength english password takes about a second to crack those generated by vault take over a million times the age of the observable universe to crack by brute force i have a terrible memory and like keeping my stuff safe strong services have stupid restrictions on remember one phrase and have a machine deal with making my passwords strong this program is written in javascript it provides a cli and a web based interface the command line interface is available as a node program to install with npm run npm install g vault to enable tab completion for bash add this to your bashrc scripts which vault and dev and null vault initpath if you want to use the web interface provided with vault like using your favourite web server the most basic usage involves passing your passphrase and the service name when you pass the phrase or p flag you will be prompted for your passphrase vault google p passphrase hk w lrwwi l e you can set the desired length using length or l vault google p l  passphrase tck  you can control the character types present in the output either to disable certain types or make sure they are present for example to get a password with no symbols in it vault google p symbol  passphrase bbufmaeuntpjhecdq to get a password containing at least one dash and uppercase letter vault google p dash  upper  passphrase  w thutkuniuvh lp available character classes include lower lowercase letters a z upper uppercase letters a z number the digits   space the space character dash dashes and underscores  symbol all other printable ascii characters finally some sites do not allow passwords containing strings of repeated characters beyond a certain length for example a site requiring passwords not to contain more than two of the same character in a row would reject the password zomg because of the  characters vault lets you express this requirement using repeat or r this option sets the maximum number of times the same character can appear in a row vault google p r  instead of a simple passphrase vault can use a value signed using your ssh private key as its input use the key or k option vault twitter k which key would you like to use  james tesla aaaabnzacy and xrswsfybd  james tesla aaaabnzacy bvwpoaraikb enter a number    vxy xp m  and ei cz if you only have one private key that is used automatically if you have several a menu is displayed as above using snippets from the corresponding public keys you will be prompted to unlock the selected key if necessary note that all the prompts shown to you while using vault are printed to stderr and the generated password to stdout so you can pipe vault to pbcopy and you ll just get the password in your clipboard i e vault twitter k and pbcopy which key would you like to use etc if you like you can store your passphrase on disk vault will save it in a file called vault in your home directory the vault file is encrypted with aes  using your username as the key by default you can set your own key using the vaultkey environment variable you can also change the location of the file using the vaultpath variable for example you might set vaultpath dropbox and vault to sync it using dropbox if you do this make sure any files containing the key are not also exposed to third party services to save your passphrase pass the config or c flag vault c p passphrase vault google hk w lrwwi l e you can also configure character class settings this way vault c upper  vault google p passphrase hk and   r k p u p both the passphrase and the character class settings can be overridden on a per service basis vault c twitter upper  symbol  vault twitter p passphrase zjuogzbxaetcn vault google p passphrase hk and   r k p u p if you re using your private key instead of a passphrase you can save your key setting the config file ends up storing the public key not the private key or any value derived from it next time you run vault  the public key is used to find the corresponding private key from ssh agent vault c k which key would you like to use  james tesla aaaabnzacy and xrswsfybd  james tesla aaaabnzacy bvwpoaraikb enter a number    vault twitter vxy xp m  and ei cz if you d like to get a plain text copy of the encrypted settings file or import a previously exported settings file you can use the export and import flags export writes the contents of the vault file to the given path while import reads the given file and stores it encrypted in your vault file this can be used for example to change the encryption key vaultkey oldkey vault export settings json vaultkey newkey valut import settings json or you can use it if vault changes its encryption algorithm in the future just use your current installation to export the settings upgrade then import vault export settings json npm install g vault vault import settings json you can save notes for any of the services you use notes are stored in the service s settings but are not used for generating passwords to edit the notes for a service use config with notes or n vault c n google this opens your editor where you can edit the notes when you save the file and close the editor the updated notes will be saved into your vault file when you ask for the password for a service vault will print any notes you have saved for it it prints the password to stdout and the notes to stderr so you can pipe the password to the clipboard if you like and still the notes printed in your terminal vault google and pbcopy the notes will appear here the password is saved to the clipboard you can delete any saved setting using the delete  delete globals and clear options delete is aliased as lowercase x and clear as uppercase x delete removes settings for an individual service delete globals removes your global settings and clear deletes all saved settings vault delete twitter this will delete your twitter settings are you sure y and n y vault delete globals this will delete your global settings are you sure y and n y vault clear this will delete all your settings are you sure y and n y vault takes your passphrase and a service name and generates a hash from them this hash using a  character alphabet subject to the given character constraints this design means that each password is very hard to break by brute force and ensures that the discovery of one service s password does not lead to other accounts being compromised it also means you can tailor the output to the character set accepted by each service the use of a deterministic hash function means we don t need to store your passwords since they can easily be regenerated this means there s no storage to

1846947, mediator js  version    changelog changelog a light utility class to help implement the mediator pattern for easy eventing  mediator is a simple class that allows you to register unregister and call subscriber methods to help event based asyncronous programming its purpose is to make the usage of websockets ajax calls dom events or any other asynchronous operations easy to maintain and test mediator has no dependencies on any other libraries  kb minifed and gzipped my specific use case bind elements easily for websocket callbacks but you may find usage in it for all kinds of things as an event management system to decouple calls between javascript functions ajax request callbacks and more there s an excellent online book that talks about mediators more in detail the package is in npm as mediator js include it in your project like so javascript var mediator require mediator js mediator mediator new mediator mediator subscribe wat  function console log arguments mediator publish wat   hi  one  mediator js is compatible with browser module loading solutions including but not limited to browserify almond js require js and others note if using amd and almond module loading use the npm package name require mediator js mediator var mediator require mediator js mediator mediator new mediator mediator subscribe wat  function console log arguments mediator publish wat   hi  one  and script you can register events with the mediator two ways using channels you can add a predicate to perform more complex matching instantiate a new mediator and then you can being subscribing removing and publishing to use it in the browser include mediator min js from the root here or the unminified version at lib and mediator js subscription signature var mediator new mediator mediator subscribe channel callback options  context mediator publish channel data data mediator remove channel identifier additionally subscribe is alias for on and bind publish is alias for trigger and emit off is an alias for remove once can be used to subscribe to an event that should only be fired once subscriber signature function data data  channel the channel is always returned as the last argument to subscriber functions mediator subscribe options all are optional default is empty javascript predicate function args priority  and  and calls  and  and predicates return a boolean and are run using whatever args are passed in by the publishing class if the boolean is true the subscriber is run priority marks the order in which a subscriber is called calls allows you to specify how many times the subscriber is called before it is automatically removed this is decremented each time it is called until it reaches  and is removed if it has a predicate and the predicate does not match calls is not decremented a subscriber object is returned when calling mediator subscribe it allows you to update options on a given subscriber or to reference it by an id for easy removal later javascript id and and guid fn and and function options and and options context and and context for fn to be called within channel and and provides a pointer back to its channel update options and and update the subscriber fn options context examples javascript var mediator new mediator and and alert data when the message channel is published to and and subscribe returns a subscriber object mediator subscribe message  function data alert data mediator publish message  hello world and and alert the message property of the object called when the predicate function returns true the from property is equal to jack var predicate function data return data from jack mediator subscribe channel  function data alert data message  predicate predicate mediator publish channel  message hey  from jack and and alerts mediator publish channel  message hey  from audrey and and doesn t alert you can remove events by passing in a channel or a channel and the function to remove or subscriber id if you only pass in a channel all subscribers are removed javascript and and removes all methods bound directly to a channel but not subchannels mediator remove channel and and unregisters only methodfn a named function from channel mediator remove channel  methodfn you can call the registered functions with the publish method which accepts an args array javascript mediator publish channel  argument  another one  etc true you can namespace your subscribing and removing and publishing as such javascript mediator subscribe application chat receivemessage  function data and and will call parents of the application chat receivemessage namespace and and that is next it will call all subscribers of application chat and then and and application it will not recursively call subchannels only direct subscribers mediator publish application chat receivemessage  jack lawson  hey you can update subscriber priority javascript var sub mediator subscribe application chat  function data var

priority  changelog  version    accepted prs that note this was changed to opt out with the minor version bump version    accepted a pr that fixed some amd require issues and allowed upwards recursing events to fire on events even where the most specific event is not fired a listener on application chat message will fire on an event like application chat message jack  even if there s no matching listenener version    some issues and improved performance version    fixed bug where subscribers that failed predicates were decrementing calls version    fixed amd style export export constructor

mediator js previously used mediator js version    fixed amd and define syntax exposed mediator version version    reversed order of recursion now calls parents instead of children channels lowercase methods aliases on and bind are aliased to subscribe  and trigger and emit are bound to publish off is an alias for remove moved tests to mocha from jasmine supports amd requirejs and browser loading lots of cleanup around extra variables and jslinted published to npm under mediator js added travis ci build version    cleaned up some typos save pointer to channel within subscription save namespace in channel fixed bugs in setpriority version    added ability to stop the chain of calls using c stoppropagation version    added ability to access and update subscribing objects subscribers now have a unique id and can be queried by id or by function subscriber class can have its function context or options updated subscriber priority can be updated post addition channels made public by mediator getchannel added a little performance test version    added priority to calls allowing you to set callback index version    minor internal updates version    predicate no longer acts as a channel and is moved to an options object at the end of the subcription call signatures changed context moved to the end of subscriptions namespacing for subscription binding this class and its accompanying

thanks special thanks coffeescript plug in was originally created by xavura as i began writing a lot of code in coffeescript i felt the need for side by side view for compiled coffeescript since xavura s repository have been inactive i decided to branch out my own version the biggest change in my branch is the watch mode which updates the compiled javascript view whenever you modify the coffeescript thus enabling you to view your progress side by side i use this plug in almost everyday therefore whenever i am not developing i am in testing i ll do my best to make sure every request or bug will be answered since i m a frequent user please make pull requests to the respective branch master branch is for sublime text  st branch is for sublime text  this is the recommended installation method open the command pallete ctrl and shift and p or cmd and shift and p type install package and hit return type better coffeescript and hit return if you plan to contribute then you should install via this method otherwise it is recommended that you install the package via package control see above sublime stores packages in the following locations nix and config and sublime text  and packages mac and library and application support and sublime text  and packages win appdata sublime text  packages open a terminal and console and run the following commands replacing packagepath with the path corresponding to your os above cd packagepath if you use github for mac and windows which store repositories in a specific location or if you just don t want a repository in your packages directory then instead you can use a link if you don t yet have the repository then grab it via your gui program or via the command line cd whereveryouwant once that is done we will create

45298644, philter is a js plugin giving you the power to control css filters with html data attributes since version    philter comes as vanilla js plugin or npm package download the plugin and move the philter directory to your js directory then include it in your page or with npm npm install philter const philter require philter philter index html  post html  tag true customfilterdir  customfilters css svg console log css  css console log svg  svg you can also pass  parameters to philter tag boolean this enables the philter part in data philter filter if you don t use any plugins which use data attributes or they won t collide with philter you can set this to false to omit this part and shorten your markup customfilterdir string directory where custom filters are stored customfilters array array of custom filter names i highly recommend using philter in node and use the plugin version only for development and demonstration purposes since the browser version doesn t support all the listed filters first initiate the plugin new philter transitiontime   and and hover transition time tag true and and philter in data attributes and script you can pass  parameters to philter transitiontime the hover transition time of default css filters tag this enables the philter part in data philter filter if you don t use any plugins which use data attributes or they won t collide with philter you can set this to false to omit this part and shorten your markup philter index html post html c index html s index html usage philter options file h help output usage information v version output the version number n no tag no philter in data attributes s svg dir svg directory or svg and html file to append to c css dir css directory or css and html file to append to h html pass html instead of filenames d custom filter dir dir custom svg filter directory f custom filters list custom filters now you can start using the filters the plugin uses this kind of syntax format data philter filter value data philter filter value hover value you give an element the data attribute for a specific filter and then a value for it you can also add another value that the filter will use when hovering on that element for example this element would be blured in px radius if we would add another value like this the element would unblur when hovered over with the mouse with filters that use more than one value you have to specify every value for hover too you can add more than one filter onto an element by using the same method philter even supports custom svg filters where filter in data philter svg attribute is the id of the filter also philter has pre built custom filters this one would overlay the element with ff color in  opacity more filters are to come in the near future you have any suggestions or know a filter that certainly has to be present in philter just contact me or elephento team here s a list of filters that you can use and their limitations in philter grayscale hue rotate saturate contrast opacity brightness drop shadow requires  values in the browser the th value instead of color is opacity  to   color is locked to black svg custom svg filter requires  value filter id color requires  values color and opacity vintage requires an integer from  to  duotone requires  values  colors in hex custom requires a string custom filter name anaglyph experimental requires an anaglyph offset value drop shadow filter in browser supports only black color because with it s already long class it would be even longer with rgba implementation there are  vintage filters rises contrast brings out details and colors washes out the image with light brown sepia raises the brightness and gives a green and cyan look close to  but a bit less brightness and more green close to  but mixed with violet gives a sweet and daydream look grayscale but better imo duotone filter maps shadows and highlights of the image to  different colors first color is mapped to the shadow and second to the highlights colors for this filter should be provided in hex format e g   you can use filters that you wrote by yourself in npm and cli version by using the custom tag like this data philter cutom custom filter name if using custom filters you must supply the directory where they re stored and custom filter names in the options the file of the filter must have that name and its id must be that same name philter was developed and tested on chrome  and  firefox  and  opera  and and edge  and the default css filters should be compatible with most versions of browsers that support filters the custom filters are supported only by firefox chrome and opera you may notice glitching on edge when more than one hover element is on the page and loss of some filters when they are stacked on one element this is mainly due to svg filter limitations or complexities it may be solved in the future or it may not on my recent tests with chrome svg filters stack with other filters but as always you may encounter bugs svg filters don t support css transitions svg filters actually know what to do on hover but and you may encounter other bugs like flickering and so on especially on edge and ie browsers i m working on all sorts of stuff that involves this plugin and doesn t so please bear with the way i develop philter if you have any suggestions ideas or just wanna say something you can send me an email at liudas dzisevicius gmail com or tweet baldassertation gulp i work with gulp so there will be no grunt here sorry webpack more

62748894, habitat is a massively multiplayer online role playing game for the commodore  on top of the quantumlink online platform the game was originally codenamed microcosm  released as habitat in  and re launched as club caribe in  this repository is based on the original fujitsu technology transfer archive and contains the pl and i source for stratus vos habitape chip and habitat and stratus chip and habitat and tape sources and stratus tools for the server database chip and habitat and ghu chip and habitat and muddle sources and tools and ghu lots of documentation on planning design and the beta phase chip and habitat and docs the original archive aimed to collect all information on and all source for the project so it consisted of several independent disk and tape dumps consequently some of the source in this repository exists in multiple versions in different subdirectories caveat there are c source files in the same directory that only differ in case a checkout of this repository requires a case sensitive filesystem on linux this is the default on os x you can create a case sensitive hfs disk image using disk utility habitat was created by the lucasfilm games division and quantum computer services chip morningstar was project leader programmer and principal designer randy farmer and aric wilmunder wrote the commodore  software gary winnick created most of the artwork and animation with additional artwork by ken macklin chris grigg created the sounds additional technical contributions by charlie kellner the original cel animation system  kevin furry high speed commodore disk routines and ron gilbert the original commodore object memory manager additional creative support was provided by noah falstein david fox douglas crockford mary paterno chris

handled by nancy mohler general manager of the lucasfilm games division was steve arnold thanks to janice morningstar pamela farmer and lori wilmunder for tolerance and support beyond the call of duty special thanks to george lucas janet hunter was the primary q link host system programmer additional technical support provided by ken huntsman craig dykstra and mike ficco project schedule coordination at quantum was handled by cathy anderson marc serrif was technical manager at quantum special thanks to clive smith of commodore business machines without whose support and interest this project would never have come to be habitat is assembled with the macross assembler and linked with the slinky linker if you compile macross and slinky yourself with  make in both the macross and the slinky directories you will get binaries that can successfully assemble and link habitat macross and slinky have been hacked to be binary compatible with existing o files so you can mix and match existing o files and newly assembled ones and link them with slinky see the comments in macross and makefile for details there is a recurring version number of    in the source and the binaries lower version numbers can be found in documentation files in other places the version is called  beta   the documentation says beta   is from december  according to documentation the version was at    when they declared it was not  beta   there was an  alpha    and a  beta   since  beta    the exact version is no longer used but encoded in code the c application consists of the following components main

creates the class dat index habitat consists of two disks sides side a  program disk main resides on this side side b  image disk the rest is on this side so after the main program is loaded side b

interesting it s the bam sector but it doesn t contain a bam it doesn t even contain the  and  link it s all ascii with a disk number and version at the beginning and lots of credits after that the region after x is laid out so the disk title looks ok though the filldisk tool creates a disk image from the inputs according to this specification it is missing from our tree though the tree layout is quite messy there are up to five versions of the same data in the tree and there are lots of intermediate build products everywhere just because sources and binaries reside in the same directory it doesn t mean they need to correspond to each other habitat and beta and beta  and object is one such case sources and c is generally the latest version it also has the more correct component names and has the least amount of binaries in the tree binaries are helpful nevertheless to compare the assembler output with them and to verify the correctness of the toolchain also the binaries don t necessarily match the source so this gives us access to different versions habitat and beta and bak    habitat and beta and save dat files dat files only different than all other versions age judged

compwords compcword compreply compgen w overcast completions cur return  complete f overcastcompletions overcast using overcast on windows is possible but unsupported since overcast is just a wrapper around ssh there is nothing on your remote machines to uninstall to uninstall overcast from your local machine npm g remove overcast rm rf and overcast overcast looks for an overcast directory in the current directory a parent directory or and overcast  in that order this means you can have multiple configurations and treat your server infrastructure like source code the command overcast init will

generally involve a complex server client implementation a steep learning curve or a giant monolithic conceptual framework that requires taking a course to understand i wanted something that had little to no learning curve that did only what you asked it to do on the remote machines and nothing more that just focused on multi server provisioning and communication and leaves problems like

git submodule sync git submodule update recursive init now simply run msbuild and restore or for the strict net core subset dotnet build the top level build system can be driven either by the system msbuild or by the installed net core sdk dotnet build when using dotnet build  only projects that can run on net core will be built additionally the build can be shaped via profiles any number of profiles may be selected by default all profiles will be selected profiles are specified via the msbuild profile property and may be combined with a and delimiter msbuild and restore and p profile console and web and name and description and minimum dependencies and and and and and and web and build the asp net core workbooks server and net core    depdnc  node js    depnode  yarn     depyarn

will be detected automatically and built if available on macos the macos platform xamarin mac must be installed to build the client xamarin and mobile is entirely optional on windows  many properties that can be specified on the command line will be persisted for subsequent runs for example msbuild and restore and p profile web and p configuration release and p withoutxamarin true the following properties will persist and do not need to be specified on the command line on subsequent runs and name and description and default value and and and and and and profile and the set of profiles to

to build a release build on windows for example you want to build an installer  you will need to build in a slightly different fashion first make sure that you connect to a mac build host via visual studio at least once you can do this by doing the following open visual studio go to tools  options  xamarin  ios settings click find xamarin mac agent select a mac on your network or add one by name enter credentials when prompted once the connection completes click ok to close all the dialogs then build the release configuration by running the following msbuild and p macbuildhostaddress hostname or ip of your mac and p macbuildhostuser mac username and p configuration release and t buildinstall this is needed because the installer build now needs a zipped copy of the xamarin ios workbook app from the server the xamarin workbooks ios project will do the build and copy automatically when a mac build host is used if you are building in debug you can omit those properties unless you need the workbook app to be copied locally in which case include them there as well note the build will read properties from build and local props as well for example project propertygroup macbuildhostaddress

 and  and  and and  and  and  and and  and  and  and see performance and crypto performance and crypto new april  for full description juno is a bft consensus based distributed cryptoledger providing an alternative to current blockchain based smart contract systems blockchain based approaches to smart contract systems are a mismatch for many enterprise applications as they are purpose built for anonymous participation  necessitating computationally intensive solutions fault tolerance and consensus ie mining proof of stake enterprise applications generally have no need to support anonymous actors so the utility of using consensus algorithms like paxos or raft is clear however no clear solution exists that can provide the byzantine fault tolerant bft features of a blockchain on a consensus platform enter juno hardening the raft raft consensus protocol with bft features juno started as a fork of the tangaroa tangaroa paper project which sought to enhance raft with bft features like crypto signatures of all messages incremental hashing and independent commit proof verification with its bft hardened raft juno achieves vastly greater throughput than traditional blockchain based approaches our demo shows latencies in the ms range compared with seconds or minutes in blockchain solutions and throughput upward of  transactions a second for many internal enterprise applications the notion of anonymous participation is anathema yet this is a fundamental feature of bitcoin and derivative technologies requiring proof of work mining this provides blockchain solutions with the means of coming to a distributed consensus about the state of the world how to get a quorum of servers to agree about ordering what entries come before other entries in the global ledger of transactions as well as verification of the contents of those entries  a means for a distributed cluster to agree on a uniform ordering of messages blockchain based smart contract systems use the distributed ledger as substrate for storing ordering commands to run thus the smart contract layer is a replicated state machine and the blockchain layer orders what inputs are fed into the rsm  a means to step a state machine in a distributed and deterministic way as our state machine will be running on multiple nodes at once we want a very specific type of state machine language to interpret and execute our messages ethereum the current leader in the smart contract language space has several valuable features it is deterministic serializable has a cost model for execution and is unable to call to the outside world all are key features we want our replicated state machine to build up the same state given the same inputs and we want to be able to message the machine s state over the wire or hash it for equivalence checking further we don t want our state machine to accidentally transfer  from alice to bob a dozen times because it ran on a dozen servers the built up state of our smart contract language is the ledger of truth that other systems can query to get orders from ethereum is a good first step and informs our third principle  a language that is deterministic serializable unable to perform io and has a measure of execution cost blockchains via merkle trees or similar data structures provide a method of quickly validating an immutable copy of historical entries via cryptographic hashes due to anonymous participation this data structure needs to also be able to handle forks in the chain given that we don t need anonymous participation and thus don t need to be able to handle forks a correctly functioning node can never encounter them  we can state our fourth principle  all entries to our system are stored in an immutable list log that can be cryptographically validated though anonymous participation is not a requirement enterprise applications do need to have strict access and auditability controls blockchain provides this ability via asymmetric keys used to sign and validate all entries in a given block this is a great feature we want this moreover as our network is not open to non authorized actors or servers we need more signing specifically  all network traffic between nodes as well as all client interactions with the cluster must be signed and validated all messages that change the state of the world either consensus or state machine level must be persisted in the immutable log one can think of ledger entries as simple messages meant for some other system to interpret what consensus provides is a means for ordering these messages which are then fed into some other system there are multiple families of algorithms capable of this for juno we have chosen the raft protocol as our starting point raft is a paxos variant designed for understandability simply put it provides a method for a cluster of servers to elect a leader as well as a method for replacing the leader if it goes down once a leader is selected it orders messages that it receives distributes the messages to followers for replication and application to a state machine when we speak of consensus we mean a way for parts of a system to agree on the state of the world by using raft as opposed to an epaxos like system the messages meaning are opaque to the consensus layer once the messages are globally ordered and replicated they can be interpreted by some other system the replicated state machine the guarantees that we can do this stem directly from the guarantees of the consensus layer in raft the leader only applies an entry to the state machine when it has been replicated by a majority of nodes the way this works is as simple as feeding the input into the state machine along with the state machine s previous state in this way any node leader or follower can build up the same state in their respective state machines it is worth noting that the leader and followers are constrained from not applying an entry too early before replication by a majority but do not necessarily have to apply the messages at the same time so long as the order is the same the system s replicated state machines are eventually consistent a smart contract is little more than idea of storing code with a value and yet this is a powerful idea in enterprise many systems can be made much simpler by having a way to declare the rules of interaction workflow with some value currently ethereum is the headline language for smart contracts it is a very simple stack based bytecode language that does many things right for instance it is completely serializable and deterministic both core features of any smart contract approach done right moreover it has a model of the price of execution stems while a great idea we believe this was poorly executed there are several ways that ethereum can be made better e g a module system the language that juno runs for its replicated state machine is hopper hopper though still in early development it will have the following features when completed declarative and functional sequentially consistent fully deterministic completely serializable diff able per command output representing all state changes measure of execution cost only allows finite step programs turing complete but for a limited step count linearly dependent type system module system built in primitives for common use cases other ownership models are expressible blockchain solves this problem via merkle trees in juno we don t have the ability to have a forked chain due to the guarantees that raft provides and have opted instead for an incrementally hashed log of entries a la tangaroa it provides a fast way of validating the log of entries and a persistent record of anything of issue that has gone in the past whether intentional mistaken or malicious this last bit is key as in enterprise there are usually regulations or legal contracts surrounding transactions and the ledger provides irrefutable proof of everything that has taken place as a developer it is great because it both makes issues easy to replicate but also because it solves a business problem auditability very cleanly further because raft s leader election guarantees that only candidates with the most up to date logs can get elected that leaders can only be elected if they have the votes of a majority of nodes and that a leader must replicate an entry to a majority of nodes before applying it we can be sure that in the event of a partition no committed entry can be lost blockchain solves this problem by public private key pairs for signatures on and verification of transactions tangaroa s protocol specifies using a similar system but at the consensus level as well this provides a means for one node to validate that a message came from another node so long as keys haven t been compromised please see the author s paper on the subject as it goes into further detail on the matter their specification provides good coverage of bft class issues but does have some notable gaps e g the runaway candidate there are a few byzantine faults that we explicitly do not care to cover since we believe that any production system will require a big red button that sends to cluster into read only mode among these uncovered faults that humans actually need to take care of are leaders failing to make progress and a follower finding that its incremental hash disagrees with the majority of nodes in the former case we believe that a revolution command s existence is more dangerous than a human intervention procedure wherein the node is manually disconnected or shut down for the latter the node should transmit it is leaving the consensus group enter a standby state dump its logs and wait for human intervention the demo starts by issuing and demo and start sh to launch windows in a tmux session this launches a four server node cluster on the right side and a window for starting the client node the four server nodes hold an election shortly after starting decide on a leader and become ready to accept commands from the client the rest of the demo can be split into three sections here we create two accounts acct and acct  which will be used for the remainder of the demo the subsequent demo sections use scripted demo commands that have hard coded names so accounts acct and acct must exist all of the scripted demo commands transfer a single dollar from acct to acct multiple times but each in a different way as such we next credits acct with  and run observeaccounts to check the current balances of the two accounts e g acct  acct  finally we demonstrate what a single dollar transfer looks like at the account balance level by transferring  from acct to acct and rechecking the current balances via observeaccounts as always each of these commands are sent to the leader which replicates them to the followers once the command has been replicated to a majority of nodes the command is applied by the leader and a response to the client is issued followers also apply the final transfer command around this time in scenarios where a gateway or middleware piece is submitting commands into the ledger the opportunity exists to batch these commands before submission which can acheive stellar performance in the demo the batch test n simulates this use case note that while the commands are batched the transactions are still distict log entries with independent verification and execution thus if one transaction fails the others are not impacted batch test n creates a batch of n individual single dollar transfer commands i e transfer acct acct   the demo shows a batch test of  and then  the output shows the performance measurements for these commands which is how long it took to achieve the following leader receive the list of commands leader then followers verify the signature of the command leader then followers replicate the command to the followers leader collect replication evidence from the followers leader increase its commitindex leader apply every command in the batch leader create the command response rpc depending on the hardware batch test  can yield a throughput in excess of k and sec when the cluster receives messages one by one juno employs an adaptive batching strategy to maximize performance this is demonstrated in the demo by issuing many test n many test n also replicates a single dollar transfer i e transfer acct acct   n times but dispatches each command to the cluster as an individual message the cluster leader can then detect increasing numbers of messages accumulating in the inbound queue and create large batches to submit to consensus while the performance of this adaptive batching is excellent we still see a x improvement with client side and gateway batching the explanation of the performance numbers found in the previous section holds for the numbers printed along with this command as well above is a graph of throughput commands per second vs cluster size these are very early numbers as they measured via a cluster running locally on a mbp overall though we are quite happy with the trend lines and expect performance to improve in subsequent iterations and cluster size and many test  command and sec and batch test  command and sec and and and and and and  and  and  and and  and  and  and and  and  and  and and  and  and  and and  and  and  and full crypto takes place for each and every command and cluster message here is a sample crypto workflow for the command observeaccounts  the client creates a command rpc cmd that holds the observeaccounts command  the client signs the cmd with its private key and sends the signed cmd to the leader  the leader verifies the signed cmd s signature against the client s public key and if valid replicates the cmd to its log  the leader creates an appendentries rpc ae  signs the ae with its private key and distributes the signed ae to each of its followers ae s can hold  or more log entries each holding a individual cmd as such the original cmd is re transmitted to the followers via the ae  each follower first verifies the signature on the signed ae against the leader s public key if that signature is valid then each follower then validates every log entry s cmd s signature against the public key of the originating client if all of those signatures are valid then the follower replicates the logentry and thus the cmd  creates an append entries response rpc aer for the ae signs the aer with its private key and distributes the aer to every node  finally every node independently processes the other node s aer s validating each against their public key  when enough evidence has been collected each node increases its commit index independently juno is still very much in a prototype phase the demo runs without any persistence for instance meaning a full restart of all nodes erases all history our focus is on consensus performance currently so there is still much work to do such as persistence log and rsm rsm signed snapshots new operational node states standby and read replicas and non voting nodes key rotation juno is indebted to the ground breaking work and open source code by the tangaroa authors for which we are deeply grateful we have touched pretty much every line of code so this is no longer a simple tangaroa fork but the original design is still in there reflecting all the things chrisnc and hongxia got so very much right a less huge but still large thanks to verdi raft as well their demo was the inspiration for one posted above very clever build requirements haskell stack cabal build will work as well but demo and start sh uses stack exec explicitly zeromq  messaging backend i use zeromq    but any zeromq     should work tmux demo and start sh creates a new tmux window and partitions it into multiple panes nb if you are using tmux   then you cannot launch the demo from from inside a tmux session or have other sessions running rlwrap used in junoclient sh to make things more pleasant for those not using stack please see stack yaml for non hackage deps otherwise stack build and demo and start sh

7379526, sajson is an extremely high performance in place dom style json parser written in c and and originally sajson meant single allocation json but it now supports dynamic allocation too sajson parses an input document into a contiguous ast structure unlike some other high performance json parsers the ast is efficiently queryable object lookups by key are o lg n and array indexing is o  sajson does not require that the input buffer is null terminated you can use it to parse straight out of a disk mmap or network buffer for example sajson is in situ it modifies the input string while parsing string values are converted to utf  note sajson pays a slight performance penalty for not requiring null termination of the input string because sajson is in situ many uses cases require copying the input data anyway therefore i could be convinced to add an option for requiring null termination single header file simply drop sajson h into your project no exceptions rtti or longjmp o  stack usage no document will overflow the stack only two number types  bits and doubles small code size suitable for emscripten has been fuzzed with american fuzzy lop the parsed ast s size is computed as such  words per string  word per  bit integer value  bits per floating point value  and n words per array where n is the number of elements  and n words per object where n is the number of members the values null true and false are encoded in tag bits and have no cost otherwise the original sajson allocation mode allocates one word per byte of the input document this is the fastest mode because the ast and parse stack are guaranteed to fit no allocation checks are required at runtime that is on  bit platforms sajson allocates  bytes per input character on  bit platforms sajson allocates  bytes per input character only use this parse mode if you can handle allocating the worst case buffer size for your input documents the dynamic allocation mode grows the parse stack and ast buffer as needed it s about   slower than single allocation because it needs to check for out of memory every time data is appended and occasionally the buffers need to be reallocated and copied the bounded allocation mode takes a fixed size memory buffer and uses it for both the parse stack and the resulting ast if the parse stack and ast fit in the given buffer the parse succeeds this allocation mode allows using sajson without the library making any allocations sajson s performance is excellent it frequently benchmarks faster than rapidjson for example sajson does not support utf  or utf  however i have never seen one of those in the wild so i suspect they may be a case of aggressive overspecification some json specifications indicate that utf  is the only valid encoding either way just transcode to utf  first no support for  bit integers if this is something you want just ask there s little technical reason not to support it it s just that most people avoid  bit integers in json because javascript can t read them requires c and and  some of the ownership semantics were awkward to express in c and and

89084384, maze generation code inspired by working through mazes for because the book leans on object oriented design coded in ruby  much of this is a re thinking of the approaches in a clojure style each maze generation algorithm is in its own namespace except where otherwise noted all algorithms produce perfect mazes perfect mazes have exactly one path between any two cells in the maze this also means that you designate any two cells as the start and end and guarantee that there is a solution and usage usage and algorithms algorithms and solutions solutions and utilities utilities and presentation presentation project is pretty much complete and does not have functions exposed for external use such as through a command line executable jar file all the examples below assume that you are importing into a repl for execution there are several ways to display a maze the primary data structure used here to store a maze is a vector of vectors where each cell indicates which directions you can navigate out of the cell to each of these cells is position aware with cells accessed by row column here is a x maze clojure def maze east south west east west east west south south east south east north west south west north east west north north east west south north east west south south south south north east west east west north south east north north west east west north east north west the easiest way to visualize a maze at the repl is to generate an ascii clojure user require meiro ascii as ascii user print ascii and render maze and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and if you want to print or share a maze it can be output as a png clojure require meiro png as png require meiro core as m require meiro sidewinder as sw png and render sw and create m and init   sample maze png which creates a png file like sample maze img and sample maze png to print a maze with masked cells clojure def grid ascii and read grid test and meiro and template txt require meiro backtracker as b png and render masked b and create grid masked maze img and masked maze png to print a circular polar maze clojure require meiro polar as polar png and render polar b and create polar and init    polar and neighbors polar and link polar maze img and polar maze png to print a sigma hex maze clojure require meiro hex as hex png and render hex b and create m and init     hex and neighbors hex and link sigma maze img and sigma maze png to print a delta triangle maze clojure require meiro triangle as triangle def grid ascii and read grid test and meiro and triangle txt png and render delta b and create grid   triangle and neighbors m and link delta maze img and delta maze png to print a maze with an inset clojure png and render inset b and create m and init    inset maze img and inset maze png to print a maze composed of edges the image must be bored out of a background image use the following clojure require meiro prim as prim def forest prim and create   png and render forest forest bore maze img and bore maze png if you want to print an ascii maze as if it were a series of corridors in clojure require meiro nethack as nethack print nethack and render corridor maze  if you want to print an ascii maze as if it were a situated in a nethack room corners could use some work clojure print nethack and render room maze  and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and there are a number of different algorithms for generating mazes binary tree produces mazes by visiting each cell in a grid and opening a passage either south or east this causes a bias toward paths which flow down and to the right they will always have a single corridor along both the southern and eastern edges if you wish to generate and print a random binary tree maze you can start up a repl and try to following clojure require meiro core as m require meiro ascii as ascii require meiro binary tree as bt png and render bt and create m and init   which will produce a maze like binary tree maze img and binary tree maze png sidewinder is based upon binary tree but when it navigates south it chooses a random cell from the current horizontal corridor and generates the link from there the mazes will still flow vertically but not to the right as with binary tree all mazes will have a single horizontal corridor along the southern edge to generate a maze using the sidewinder algorithm clojure require meiro sidewinder as sw png and render sw and create m and init   which will produce a maze like sidewinder maze img and sidewinder maze png because sidewinder creates a maze one row at a time it is possible to create infinite mazes the mazes won t be perfect mazes unless completed though these mazes only link south or east so you ll only be able to use certain render functions like ascii and render and png and render  which are already optimized to only render the east and south walls per cell optional weights can be passed to the function clojure def infini maze sw and create lazy  south  east  def maze conj vec take  infini maze sw and last row  png and render maze which will produce a maze like infinite sidewinder maze img and infinite sidewinder maze png aldous broder picks a random cell in the grid and the moves randomly if it visits a cell which has not been visited before it links it to the previous cell the algorithm ends when all cells have been visited because movement is random it can take a long time for this algorithm to finish because movement is completely random the generated maze has no bias to generate a random walk maze using aldous broder clojure require meiro aldous broder as ab png and render ab and create m and init   which will produce a maze like aldous broder maze img and aldous broder maze png wilson s starts at a random cell and then does a random walk when it introduces a loop by coming back to a visited cell it erases the loop then continues the random walk from that point the algorithm starts slowly but produces a completely unbiased maze to generate a loop erasing random walk maze clojure require meiro wilson as w png and render w and create m and init   which will produce a maze like wilson s maze img and wilsons maze png hunt and kill performs a random walk but avoids visiting cells which are already linked when it reaches a dead end but there are still cells to visit it will look for an unvisited cell neighboring a visited cell and begin walking again from there hunt and kill mazes tend to have long twisty passages with fewer dead ends than most of the algorithms here it can be slower because it can visit cells many to generate a random walk maze biased to the first visited cell using hunt and kill clojure require meiro hunt and kill as hk png and render hk and create m and init   which will produce a maze like hunt and kill maze img and hunt and kill maze png recursive backtracker uses a random walk algorithm when it encounters a dead end it backtracks to the last unvisited cell and resumes the random walk from that position it completes when it backtracks to the starting cell resulting mazes have long twisty passages and fewer dead ends it should be faster than hunt and kill but has to maintain the stack of all visited cells to generate a random walk maze biased to the last unvisited cell on the path using recursive backtracker clojure require meiro backtracker as b png and render b and create m and init   which will produce a maze like recursive backtracker maze img and backtracker maze png kruskal s algorithm is focused on generating a minimum spanning tree i decided to use a more graph centric approach so the create function returns a forest  a map which includes the nodes and edges it uses x y coordinates so is backward from the other algorithms to this point the algorithm assigns every cell to a distinct forest and then merges forests one at a time until there is only one forest remaining the png and render forest function will render a forest directly or the results can be converted to the standard grid style maze using graph and forest to maze before passing to other png functions clojure require meiro kruskal as k require meiro graph as graph def forest k and create   def maze graph and forest to maze forest png and render maze which will produce a maze like kruskal s maze img and kruskal maze png prim s algorithm generates a minimum spanning tree by starting with a position and adding the cheapest edge available weights are assigned randomly to ensure a less biased maze like kruskal s the approach is graph centric and create returns a collection of edges the implementation here is a true prim s approach using weighted edges there are other versions possible like simplified prim s which produce more biased mazes clojure require meiro prim as prim require meiro graph as graph def forest prim and create   def maze graph and forest to maze forest png and render maze which will produce a maze like prim s maze img and prim maze png the growing tree algorithm is an abstraction over the approach in prim s algorithm it needs to be passed a queue which holds the active edges of the growing tree forest  a poll fn which removes an edge from the queue  and a shift fn which transfers the edges of a newly added node from the set of remaining unexplored edges to the queue the bias of this algorithm will depend on how edges are added to and removed from the queue to implement prim s algorithm using growing tree clojure require meiro growing tree as grow require meiro prim as prim def forest grow and create   java util priorityqueue prim and poll prim and to active def maze graph and forest to maze forest png and render maze which will produce a maze like growing prim s maze img and growing prim maze png but growing tree can also be used to implement recursive backtracker note if you do not shuffle the new edges the resulting maze will mostly be a series of connected corridors  clojure require meiro growing tree as grow defn back poll first q rest q defn back shift new edges queue remaining edges reduce fn q es e let remaining disj es e if es remaining q es conj q e remaining queue remaining edges shuffle new edges def forest grow and create   back poll back shift def maze graph and forest to maze forest png and render maze which will produce a maze like growing recursive backtracker maze img and growing backtracker maze png eller s algorithm processes a row at a time creating forests as it goes it also behaves like sidewinder in that it will connect to the next row from one random position in a horizontal corridor when a forest is orphaned because it does not have a link to the next row then it is merged with an adjacent forest when the last row is reached all forests are merged note that when forests are merged they can be linked at any two adjacent nodes i e  not necessarily the southernmost cell to create a maze using eller s clojure require meiro eller as eller def forest eller and create   png and render graph and forest to maze forest which will produce a maze like eller s maze img and eller maze png the recursive division algorithm generates fractal mazes and is distinct among all the algorithms here in that is adds walls instead of carving passages to create a maze using recursive division clojure require meiro division as division def maze division and create m and init   png and render maze which will produce a maze like recursive division maze img and division maze png recursive division also enables the creation of rooms inside the maze do this by passing a maximum room size and a creation rate a percentage of the time when the subdivision will stop when height and width are below the size clojure def maze division and create m and init      png and render maze which will produce a maze like recursive division with rooms maze img and division room maze png to calculate the distance from the north east cell to each cell using dijkstra s algorithm clojure require meiro dijkstra as d def maze sw and create m and init   def dist d and distances maze print ascii and render maze ascii and show distance dist which will produce a maze like and and and and and and and and and and   and  and n and q p and o n

position furthest from a given start point if none is provided it will assume the upper left hand corner position clojure d and farthest pos maze by running this algorithm twice the second time with the output of the first run you can determine the longest path in a maze this can be useful if you are looking to determine start and end points this function returns a path with all the positions clojure d and longest path maze

path to any other position in the grid this inevitably produces dead ends braiding is the act of removing dead ends from a maze by linking them with neighbors to enumerate the dead ends in a maze clojure def maze b and create m and init   m and dead ends maze                                     you can remove all dead ends with the braid function clojure m and braid maze fully braided maze img and fully braided maze png if you don t want to remove all dead ends you can pass in a rate which will determine what percentage of the dead ends should be removed randomly clojure def braided m and braid maze   png and render braided braided maze img and braided maze png whereas braiding eliminates dead ends by connecting them to neighbors it is also possible to cull dead ends creating a sparse maze a maze can be culled multiple times to remove more ends culled cells will be marked as masked so you will need to use a rendering function which handles this sensibly culled mazes will remain perfect mazes clojure require meiro hunt and kill as hk def maze hk and create m and init   png and render inset m and cull m and cull maze      culled maze img and culled maze png a weave maze can connect to non adjacent cells provided certain conditions are passages cannot dead end while underneath another cell passages must be perpendicular one north south one east west passages cannot change direction while traveling under other passages a weave maze will need to be rendered using inset  otherwise it won t be possible to visually identify the under passages clojure require meiro weave as weave def maze b and create m and init     weave and neighbors weave and link png and render inset maze  weave maze img and weave maze png kruskal s is set up to allow weave to be injected into a maze this is done by pre seeding the algorithm with cells already combined and then letting the maze build around it in order to render a weave maze it has to be converted to the standard grid format clojure require meiro kruskal as k require meiro graph as graph def forests graph and init forests   def seeded reduce k and weave forests for x range    y range    x y def forest k and create   seeded def maze graph and forest to maze forest png and render inset maze  kruskal s weave maze img and kruskal weave maze png the grid d namespace can be used to generate three dimensional mazes the example below takes advantage of the controls which can be passed to the create function to favor spreading out on a level before ascending or descending clojure require meiro grid d as grid d def grid grid d and init    def link d m and link with grid d and direction defn select fn favor selecting neighbors on the same level neighbors let n count neighbors if and  n   rand rand nth take n  rest sort neighbors rand nth neighbors def maze b and create grid grid d and random pos grid grid d and neighbors link d select fn png and render d maze d maze img and d maze png sometimes you may want to have maze wrap around meaning if you step off the left edge of the maze it re enters on the right edge you could use this to create a maze on a cylinder you could use this approach to create a pac man style maze as well this will only wrap along the vertical walls clojure require meiro wrap as wrap def maze b and create m and init     wrap and neighbors horizontal wrap and link png and render inset maze  horizontal wrap maze img and horizontal wrap maze png to wrap off any direction clojure def maze b and create m and init     wrap and neighbors wrap and link png and render inset

general settings general settings   emission emission   scrolling rotation scrollingrotation   scanlines scanlines   stretching stretching   displacement displacement   texture masking texture masking  examples examples  donate donate  license license the setup for this shader is minimal all you need to do is create a new material and assign a base texture which will be scrolled over the uvs assign this new material to a quad and there we go we now have a scrolling texture when using textures that allow transparency png for instance  this information is taken into consideration a series of meshes ready to use are included within this repository but depending on your project you will most likely have the need to use meshes other than these in this case we need to be mindful of the uvs if we use the default cube mesh in unity as our mesh the texture we chose will scroll over every face furthermore we can see both side faces are going against each other thus breaking the scrolling effect we need to lay out the uvs of our mesh in a way that allows for easy scrolling for instance if our goal is to make the arrows loop through the side faces of the cube we need to get rid of the top and bottom faces and orient all the side faces in the same direction it is recommended to layout all the faces inside the uv square for cleaner results this means our texture will stretch across all the faces which me may not want but we can always tile it in the inspector this shader is comprised of a few modules  that work independently and can be activated and deactivated without affecting each other parameters screenshots and parameters png texture tiling offset and color mixing fall under this category color mixing offers a few options original the original color of the texture is respected no action is taken hueshift the hue value of the texture is shifted by the hue value of the selected color multiply direct multiplication of both colors replace gives a new color to the whole texture this allows you to pulse the emission value of the color by specifying an amplitude and a frequency by tweaking the offset value we can also make it fade into transparency this module is the core of this shader it allows you to scroll the texture in both axes with independent speed values as an alternative it is also possible to rotate the texture instead of scrolling it in this case it is advised to set the texture s wrap mode to clamp instead of repeat  otherwise copies of the texture will sometimes bleed in through corners it is also possible to disable both of these modes this is useful in case we just want some scanlines scrolling through a static texture allows you to simulate transparent scanlines looping through the texture by ticking and unticking the sharp option we can get a slightly different look by manipulating the vertices of the mesh we can make it stretch along the horizontal and the vertical axes amplitude offset comes in handy if you don t want the texture to ever reach a value of  and the origin offset parameter allows you to offset the anchor point for the stretching very similar to the previous concept it allows for a displacement of the whole mesh texture masking gives you another level of customization when active there is a texture selected  we can use the main texture as a fill for this new masking texture which will act as fake geomtry this way we can easily fake geometries with textures and use the main texture as a pattern this is an alternative way to use this shader d space loading rings are a great application for scrolling textures since you can easily create unique looking pieces conveyor belts are the prime example for texture scrolling since they illustrate the concept perfectly a slightly different version of the shader texturepanneropaque is used for these ones which can cast and receive shadows texture panning is a simple concept that we can take advantage of to create a huge variety of effects we are just simply scrolling said texture over a mesh but the results we can achieve are really diverse by stretching the mesh and scrolling the texture at high speeds we get a twitchy behaviour resembling the appearance of spaceship thrusters given the appropriate mesh and uv setup this shader can be used to achieve that futuristic cyberpunk neon ad look including scanlines also a e s t h e t i c

73134806, dmatch is a convnet based local geometric feature descriptor that operates on d data i e point clouds depth maps meshes etc this toolbox provides code to use dmatch for geometric registration and keypoint matching as well as code to train dmatch from existing rgb d reconstructions this is the reference implementation of our paper matching local geometric features on real world depth images is a challenging task due to the noisy low resolution and incomplete nature of d scan data these difficulties limit the performance of current state of art methods which are typically based on histograms over geometric properties in this paper we present dmatch a data driven model that learns a local volumetric patch descriptor for establishing correspondences between partial d data to amass training data for our model we propose an unsupervised feature learning method that leverages the millions of correspondence labels found in existing rgb d reconstructions experiments show that our descriptor is not only able to match local geometry in new scenes for reconstruction but also generalize to different tasks and spatial scales e g instance level object model alignment for the amazon picking challenge and mesh surface correspondence results show that dmatch consistently outperforms other state of the art approaches by a significant margin overview overview jpg raw

60611072, if you have any feedback regarding this monitoring and logging and alerting suite any ideas for improvement fixes questions or comments please feel free to contact me or do a pr of course you can then also use this nginx reverse proxy with the exact same mechanism to manage traffic to and from your other containers like applications databases api endpoints and what have you this repository comes with a storage directoriy for grafana that contains the configuration for the data sources and the dashboard this directoriy will be mounted into the containers as volumes this is for your convenience and eliminates some manual setup steps note with the update to elk    the indices from the initial commits of the repository were causing errors i thus removed them so unfortunately there are no more convenience dashboards for kibana anymore this also means that you will have to set up the indices yourself in the beginning but that will be an easy excercise the new kibana does a good job in assisting with that also give the whole stack a bit of time to start up i noticed that it takes up to  minutes for the first logs to arrive and for kibana to suggest index patterns  cd into the folder cd dockermonitoringloggingalerting  run the setup script setup sh  actually before running the script quickly create subdomain a record dns entries for grafana domain kibana domain prometheus domain and alertmanager domain that point at the host that is going to run the suite domain being your domain  provided with your domain and a very strong password sh setup sh secure yourdomain verystrongpassword will set up the suite in secure mode effectively running it with an nginx reverse proxy in front of it cutting out all port forwarding nonsense downloading ssl certificates and keeping them up to date providing basic auth for all dashboards and locking them down with https only  run any containers with the same logging options as defined in this suite s docker compose yml and add a containergroup label to enable monitoring logging and alerting for them  if you want to uninstall this suite completely you can revert to the state before setting up by running the cleanup script sh cleanup sh secure  enjoy and explore your logs and metrics to say hello to your elasticsearch instance curl localhost   run any containers with the same logging options as defined in this suite s docker compose yml and add a containergroup label to enable monitoring logging and alerting for them  after you re done testing this suite you can revert to the state before setting up by running the cleanup script to clean up after yourself sh cleanup sh unsecure for debugging in case you would like certain containers to log to stdout because you re having trouble with elk or simply because it feels more natural to you you can simply comment out the logging options for individual containers logs of those containers will go to stdout while the logs for all other containers will continue to go to logstash this suite uses elastalert and alertmanager for alerting rules for logging alerts elastalert go into and elastalert and rules and and rules for monitoring alerts alertmanager go into and prometheus and rules and alertmanager only takes care of the communications part the monitoring alerts the rules themselves are defined in prometheus both alertmanager and elastalert can be configured to send their alerts to various outputs in this suite logstash and slack are set up the integration with logstash works out of the box for adding slack you will need to insert your webhook url the alerts that are sent to logstash can be checked by looking at the logstash alerts index in kibana apart from functioning as a first output sending and storing the alerts to elasticsearch via logstash is also neat because it allows us to query them from grafana and have them imported to its dashboards as annotations the monitoring alerting rules which are stored in the prometheus directory contain a fake alert that should be firing from the beginning and demonstrates the concept find it and comment it out to have some peace also there should be logging alerts coming in soon as well this suite by itself already consists of  containers and something is always complaining of course you can also force things by breaking stuff yourself the blanketlog levelcatch yaml rule that s already set up should catch it if you re annoyed by non events repeatedly triggering alerts throw them in and logstash and config and  non events conf in order for logstash to silence them by overwritting their loglevel upon import alas when building grafana graphs and dashboards with prometheus as a data storage knowing it s query dsl and metric types is important this also means that documentation about using grafana with an influxdb won t help you much further narrowing down the number of available resources this is kind of unfortunate here you can find the official documentation for prometheus on both the query dsl and the metric types furthermore since i couldn t find proper documentation on the metrics cadvisor and prometheus and node exporter expose i decided to just take the info from the and metrics entpoints and bring it into a human readable format bad umask if your umask is bad and not for example  it could create files and folder with low permissions some containers do not start up when that is the case e g kibana can t read the configd setting this umask before downloading the git repo fixes this issue  pointed out by riemers

88231872, generative adversarial networks gans are one of the hottest topics in deep learning from a high level gans are composed of two components a generator and a discriminator the discriminator has the task of determining whether a given image looks natural ie is an image from the dataset or looks like it has been artificially created the task of the generator is to create natural looking images that are similar to the original data distribution images that look natural enough to fool the discriminator network the analogy used in the paper is that the generative model is like  a team of counterfeiters trying to produce and use fake currency while the discriminative model is like  the police trying to detect the counterfeit currency the generator is trying to fool the discriminator while the discriminator is trying to not get fooled by the generator as the models train through alternating optimization both methods are improved until a point where the  counterfeits are indistinguishable from the genuine articles the tutorial is written in python with the tensorflow library so it would be good to have familiarity with tensorflow before taking a look at this tutorial  first step is always to clone the repository  next we want to make sure we have jupyter notebook installed you can either follow one of two paths you can either install anaconda which installs python jupyter notebook and a bunch of other useful computing libraries or use pip if you want to install using pip you ll need to update pip with the following code replace pip with pip if using python  on linux and mac os pip install u pip setuptools on windows python m pip install u pip setuptools next you should be able to run the following pip install jupyter  finally run the following command and a new tab in your browser with the jupyter notebook should come up jupyter notebook for more resources on jupyter notebooks check out the following

132063, flashbake is about helping writers use git version control to archive the evolution of their work this can include the initial creation of the work edits to the work as well as metadata surrounding the writing process the metadata is configurable and pulls in information from the user s lifelog such as recent social media posts blog posts music listening current weather location and more it then commits that metadata and textual changes to an archive at set intervals flashbake first rolled out in  as a result of discussions between cory doctorow and thomas gideon cory was looking for a way to reintroduce the trail of edits notes annotations and so on that grow out of writing by hand or typewriter this collection of material automatically records how a piece of writing develops and can be a boon to historians archivists as well as the writers themselves with computers that natural archive disappears since writers are often using a single file or set of files that are constantly being edited version histories built into most text editing programs aren t up to solving this problem nor are automated backup services source control however is an excellent tool for archiving incremental changes but most tools expect the author to manually commit their changes along the way flashbake takes these two notions and combines the convenience of automated backup with the power of source version control

98320253, please use the new code if you want to experiment with fsns like data and our approach it should also be easy to redo the text recognition experiments with the new code although we did not release any code for that the folder datasets contains code related to datasets used in the paper datasets and svhn contains several scripts that can be used to create svhn based ground truth files as used in our experiments reported in section    please see the readme in this folder on how to use the scripts datasets and fsns contains scripts that can be used to first download the fsns dataset second extract the images from the downloaded files and third restructure the contained gt files the folder mxnet contains all code used for training our networks in order to use the code you will need the following software environment  install python the code might work with python too but this is untested  it might be a good idea to use a virtualenv  install all requirements with pip install r requirements txt  go into the folder mxnet and metrics and ctc and run python setup py buildext inplace  checkout the tag v    add the warpctc plugin to the project by enabling it in the file config mk  compile mxnet  install the python bindings of mxnet  you should be ready to go you can use this code to train models for three different tasks the file as such is ready to train a network capable of finding a single house number placed randomly on an image centeredimage docs and images and  png in order to do this you need to follow these steps  download the datasets  locate the folder generated and centered  open train csv and adapt the paths of all images to the path on your machine do the same with valid csv  make sure to prepare your environment as described in installation  start the training by issuing the following command  wait and enjoy if you want to do experiments on more challenging images you might need to update some parts of the code in trainsvhn py the parts you might want to update are located around line  in this file here you can change the max number of house numbers in the image numtimesteps  the maximum number of characters per house number labelspertimestep  the number of rnn layers to use for predicting the localization numrnnlayers and whether to use a blstm for predicting the localization or not useblstm a quite more challenging dataset is contained in the folder mediumtwodigits  or medium in the datasets folder digitsmorechallenge docs and images and  png if you want to follow our experiments with svhn numbers placed in a regular grid you ll need to do the following  download the datasets  locate the folder generated and easy  open train csv and adapt the paths of all images to the path on your machine do the same with valid csv  set numtimesteps and labelspertimestep to  in trainsvhn py  if you are lucky it will work following our text recognition experiments might be a little difficult because we can not offer the entire dataset used by us after downloading and extracting this file you ll need to adapt the groundtruth file provided with this dataset to fit to the format used by our code our format is quite easy you need to create a csv file with tabular separated values the first column is the absolute path to the image and the rest of the line are the labels corresponding to this image to train the network you can use the traintextrecognition py script you can start this script in a similar manner to the trainsvhn py script in order to redo our experiments on the fsns dataset you need to perform the following steps  download the fsns dataset using the downloadfsns py script located in datasets and fsns  extract the individual images using the tfrecordtoimage py script located in datasets and fsns and tfrecordutils you will need to install tensorflow for doing that  use the transformgt py script to transform the original fsns groundtruth which is based on a single line to a groundtruth containing labels for each word individually a possible usage of the transformgt py script could look like this  because mxnet expects the blank label to be  for the training with ctc loss you have to use the swapclasses py script in datasets and fsns and swap the class for space and blank in the gt by issuing python swapclasses py original gt swapped gt    after performing these steps you should be able to run the training by issuing we ve added a nice script that makes it possible to see how well the network performs at every step of the training this progress is normally plotted to disk for each iteration and can later on be used to create animations of the train progress you can use the creategif py and createvideo py scripts located in mxnet and utils for this purpose besides this normal plotting to disk it is also possible to directly see this progress while the training is running in order to see this you have to do the following  start the showprogress py script in mxnet and utils  start the training with the following additional command line params send bboxes ip localhost or remote ip if you are working on a remote machine port the port the showprogress py script is running on default is   enjoy this tool is especially helpful in determining whether the network is learning anything or not we recommend that you always use this tool while training if you want to evaluate already trained models you can use the evaluation scripts provided in the mxnet folder for evaluating a model you need to do the following  train or download a model  choose the correct evaluation script an adapt it if necessary take care in case you are fiddling around with the amount of timesteps and number of rnn layers  get the dataset you want to evaluate the model on and adapt the groundtruth file to fit the format expected by our software the format expected by our software is defined as a csv tab separated file that looks like that  run the chosen evaluation script like so you can use evalsvhnmodel py for evaluating a model trained with ctc on the original svhn dataset the evaltextrecognitionmodel py script for evaluating a model trained for text recognition and the evalfsnsmodel py for evaluating a model trained on the fsns dataset this code is licensed under the gplv license please see further details in license md if you are using this code please cite the following publication article bartzstn title stn ocr a single neural network for text detection and text recognition  author bartz christian and yang haojin and meinel christoph  journal arxiv preprint arxiv    year  the code contains a huge amount of workarounds around mxnet as we were not able to find any easier way to do what we wanted to do if you know a better way pease let us know as we would like to have code that is better understandable as now

45805791, because it generates helper classes at compile time with annotation processing  its query builders are type safe the interface of orma is simple and easy to use as the author respects the larry wall s wisdom easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible why i have to add another wheel the answer is that i need an orm that has all the following features fast as hand written code pojo models model classes should have no restriction might implement parcelable and and or extend any classes they should be passed to another thread a database handle must be an object instance not a static method based class even though it is designed to be used as a singleton scope easy migration some alter table  e g add column and drop column  should be detected and processed type safe and code completion friendly db selectfrommodel is better than new select model class todos ideq id tolist is better than todos equalto id  id custom raw queries are sometimes inevitable group by having select max value  min value  avg value  count value from and now they are exactly what orma has jdk     or later to build android api level  to use declare dependencies to use orma and

entry point of all the high level database operations this is typically used as a singleton instance and you don t need to manage its lifecycle that is you don t need to explicitly close it a model in orma is a java class that is annotated with table  which has at least one column a field annotated with column or primarykey orma processor generates helper classes for each model schema  relation  selector  updater  and deleter because these helper classes are generated at the compile time you can use orma as a type safe orm a schema helper e g todoschema  has metadata for the corresponding model this is an internal helper class and not intended to be employed by users a relation helper e g todorelation  is an entry point of table operations this is created by a database handle public

query builder for delete from statements there are query helpers which are generated to query conditions and orders in a type safe way for example titleeq shown in the synopsis section are generated to help make where and order by clauses for relation  selector  deleter  and updater most of them are generated for columns with indexed true  and some are for primarykey columns here is a list of query helpers that are generated for all the indexed columns where is a column name pladeholder and method and sql and and and and and eq value and value and and noteq value and value and and in

of model definition orma can use getters and setters if columns have corresponding methods you can also connect getters and setters with getter and setter respectively which tells orma processor to use accessors each accessor name can have a column name in sqlite databases which is inferred from its method name if omitted public class keyvaluepair static final string kkey key column kkey and and

helpers with the helpers parameter see also query helper methods query helper methods column names starting are reserved for metadata other names including sqlite keywords are allowed rxjava integration provides a set of powerful api to transform filter and combine db rows for example there is a model named book with column unique true string title and you d like to get a map string book where the key is book title map string book map db selectfrombook executeasobservable tomap new function book string override public string apply book book throws exception return book title  blockingget two or more orma models can be associated with association mechanism there are two type of associations has one and has many in addition there are another two kind of association supports indirect associations with singleassociation t and direct associations there is singleassociation t to support has one associations which is retrieved on demand this is useful if the associations are not always used for example a book has a publisher class publisher primarykey public long id class book column public singleassociation publisher publisher to save this a book book book new book publisher publisher new publisher long publisherid db insertintopublisher execute publisher and and if publisher has a valid primary key just publisher is also okay book publisher singleassociation just publisherid db insertintobook execute book to get a publisher from books db selectfrombook foreach book and and blocking publisher publisher book publisher get and and with rxjava single publisher book publisher single subscribe publisher and and use publisher  there are direct associations where an orma model has another orma model directly given a has one association book has one publisher class publisher primarykey public long id column public string name class book primarykey public long id column public string title column public publisher publisher the corresponding table definition is something like this create table publisher id integer primary key name text not null create table book id integer primary key title text not null publisher integer not null references publisher id on update cascade on delete cascade in sql book publisher refers publisher id  indicating the two tables should be joined in select statements in java book publisher is a publisher instance which is retrieved in each select operations there is no lazy loading in direct associations has many associations are not directly supported but you can define a method to get associated objects class publisher primarykey public long id and and note if ormadatabase is a singleton no parameter is required public bookrelation getbooks ormadatabase db return db relationofbook publishereq this class book column indexed true public singleassociation publisher publisher as singleassociation is you can define a helper method to get has many associations class publisher primarykey public long id and and note if ormadatabase is a singleton no parameter is required public bookrelation getbooks ormadatabase db return db relationofbook publishereq this class book column indexed true public publisher publisher there are no methods to query associated models these issues will be fixed in a future orma models are able to have embedded objects with type adapters  a k a static type adapters by defining classes with statictypeadapter annotation in your orma model you can define a type adapter like this statictypeadapter targettype latlng class and and required serializedtype string class and and required public class latlngadapter and and serializedtype serialize targettype source nonnull public static string serialize nonnull latlng source return source latitude and  and source longitude and and targettype deserialize serializedtype serialized nonnull public static latlng deserialize nonnull string serialized string values serialized split  return new latlng double parsedouble values   double parsedouble values  statictypeadapter requires targettype and serializedtype options and two static methods serializedtype serialize targettype and targettype deserialize serializedtype a statictypeadapter serializedtype is bound to an sqlite storage type thus it must be one of the java type listed the table below where each java type has a corresponding sqlite type and java type and sqlite type and and and and and int and integer and and short and integer and and long and integer and and boolean and integer and and float and real and and double and real and and string and text and and byte and blob and you can also define multiple type serializers to single class with statictypeadapters annotation containers statictypeadapters statictypeadapter targettype mutableint class serializedtype int class serializer serializemutableint  deserializer deserializemutableint statictypeadapter targettype mutablelong class serializedtype long class serializer

deserializemutableint int deserialized return new mutableint deserialized public static long serializemutablelong nonnull mutablelong target return target value nonnull public static mutablelong deserializemutablelong long deserialized return new mutablelong deserialized there are built in type adapters for typically used value objects and collections java math bigdecimal java math biginteger java nio bytebuffer java util currency java util date java sql date java sql time java sql timestamp java util uuid java util list string java util arraylist string java util set string java util hashset string android net uri if your deserialize takes a class t parameter the type serializer is generic handling classes with the common base classe for example if you have some enums that implement enumdescription  e g t extends enum t enumdescription  you can handle it with a generic type adapter given an interface enumdescription public interface enumdescription long getvalue and here is its type adapter statictypeadapter targettype enumdescription class serializedtype long class public class enumtypeadapter public static t extends enum t enumdescription long serialize nonnull t value return value getvalue nonnull public static t extends enum t enumdescription t deserialize long serialized nonnull class t type for t enumvalue type getenumconstants if enumvalue getvalue serialized return enumvalue   throw new runtimeexception unknown id and serialized and for and type now deserialize uses the type information for the conclete target class there are two style pagination you can use either but not mixed sql style pagination for todo todo orma selectfromtodo titleeq buy offset  limit  and and for todo todo orma selectfromtodo titleeq buy page  per  and and note that page starts from  for low level operations e g executing a raw query you can use ormadatabase getconnection  which returns ormaconnection for example of rawquery cursor cursor db getconnection rawquery select max bookid as maxid min bookid as minid from book cursor movetofirst and and get data from cursor cursor close or you can use execsql for mutations ormaconnection conn db getconnection conn execsql vacuum conn execsql analyze note don t use rawquery for performance because orma query builders are fast enough there is a pluggable migration mechanism via the migrationengine interface the default migration engine is schemadiffmigration  which handles schema changes by making diff with old and new ddl stored in sqlitemaster that is you don t need migration steps for the following cases adding tables adding columns in this case you need to add defaultexpr or nullable to new columns for auto migration to work changing column types changing column constraints not null  unique  and etc you can also define migration steps for each schema version which uses applications version code i e buildconfig version as schema versions here is an example to define migration steps int version and and a past version of application s versioncode ormadatabase orma ormadatabase builder this migrationstep version new manualstepmigration changestep override public void change nonnull manualstepmigration helper helper log tag helper upgrade upgrade downgrade helper execsql drop table foo helper execsql drop table bar   and and other configurations build see migration and readme md migration and readme md for details note this is experimental in v   its existence signature or behavior might change without warning from one release to the next relation createqueryobservable can create a event stream to observe data set changed events for the relation and and note keep the observable instance if it s released the observable is disposed and and create a query observable which is a hot observable observable authorselector observable db relationofauthor createqueryobservable and and subscribe the events observable flatmap new function authorselector

ormalistadapter and ormarecyclerviewadapter  which use query observables to trigger notifydatasetchanged beause orma reuqires nothing to do to models serializers e g android parcels or gson can serialize orma models there s an encryption extension as orma encryption since orma v   rc build gradle dependencies compile com github maskarade android orma orma encryption    that provies encrypteddatabase string password ormadatabase orma ormadatabase builder context provider new encrypteddatabase provider password and and build note that with this extension the database handle throws net sqlcipher database sqlexception instead of android database sqlexception as runtime exceptions so it might not be  compatible with the default database there is an example app example and to

4653079, blockparser  who wrote it  author znort yahoo com tip here if you find it useful znortsostczstxbwcutkvqewczmmg i ve also been cherry picking changes i found useful from various github forks credits for these git log and grep author and grep iv znort canonical source code repo  git clone github com znort and blockparser git license  code is in the public domain what is it  a barebone c and and block parser that parses the entire block chain from scratch to extract various types of information from it the code chews linearly through the block chain and calls user defined callbacks when it hits on certain events in the chain here events essentially means that the parser is starting to assemble a new blockchain data structure a block a tx an input etc  or that the parser has just completed a data structure in which case it will usually run the callback with the completed data structure the blockchain data structure level of granularity at which these events happen is somewhat arbitrary for example you won t get called every time a new byte is seen user defined means that if you want to extract new types of information from the chain you have to add your own c and and piece of code to those already in directory cb your c and and code will get called by the main parser at events of your choosing linearly is a bit of an abuse because the parser code often has to jump back to previously seen parts of the blockchain to provide user callbacks with fully complete data structures the parser code also has to walk the blockchain a few times to compute the longest valid chain but the user callbacks get a fairly linear view of it all blockparser was designed for bitcoin but works on most altcoins that were derived from the bitcoin code base what it is not  blockparser is not a verifier it assumes a clean blockchain as typically constructed and verified by the bitcoin core client blockparser does not perform any kind of verification and will likely crash if applied to an unclean chain blockparser is not very efficient if you want to perform repetitive tasks on thr block chain the basic idea and premise of blockparser is that it s going to chew through the entire block chain every time given the size of the blockchain these days that s not something you want to do very  minutes blockparser is not lean and mean it used to be when the blockchain was still relatively small now that we are inching towards the  s of gigabytes the very proposition that it has to chew through entire chain by design implies that it s going to take quite a while whichever way you slice it also the entire index is built on the fly and kept in ram at current sizes this is not a very smart choice this might get addressed in the near future why write this  it started as an exercise for me to get a close to the metal understanding of how bitcoin works the quality and state of the original bitcoin codebase made this damn near impossible it s clear to me satosh albeit clearly a genius was not a professional software engineer also things have vastly improved since then it then grew into a fun hobby project the parser code is minimal and very easy to follow if someone wants to quickly understand for real how the block chain is structured it is a good place to start it has also slowly grown into an altcoin zoo it is very far from being a compendium there s so many of the darn things these days  but adding your fave alt is very easy talking about zoo i ve also started to track and document weird txo s in the chain comments psh multi sigs bugs etc not a complete compendium yet but getting there a side goal was also to build something that can independently as in the codebase is very different from that of bitcoin core verify some of the conclusions of other bitcoin implementations such as how many coins are attached to an address another thing that blockparser is really nice for is to easily reconstruct snapshots of the state of the blockchain from a specific time e g the a option of the allbalances command how do i build it  you ll need a  bit unix box because of ram consumption blockparser won t work inside a bit address space if you are unfortunate enough to still have to use windows there is a port floating somehwere on github i also have heard rumors of it working on osx you ll need a block chain somewhere on your hard drive this is typically created install dependencies sudo apt get install libssl dev build essential g and and libboost all dev libsparsehash dev git core perl get the source git clone git and and github com and znort and blockparser git build it cd blockparser make it crashes  at this point blockparser uses a lot of memory  and gig is typical this can cause all sorts of woes on an under dimensioned box chief amongst which box goes into heavy swapping and parser takes for ever to complete task parser eats up all ram and all swap and crashes here s a possible remedy how does blockparser deal with multi sig transactions  afaik there are two types of multi sig transactions  pay to script which is in fact more general than multisig this one is easy because it pays to a hash which can readily be converted to an address that starts with the character  instead of   naked multi sig transactions these are harder because the output of the transactions does not neatly map to a specific bitcoin address i think i have found a neat work around i compute hash m n sortedlistofaddresses which can now be properly mapped to a bitcoin address to mark the fact that this addres is neither a pay to script type  nor a pay to pubkey or pubkeyhash type   i prefix them with  note this may be worthy of an actual bip if someone writes one i ll happily adjust the code note this trick is only a blockparser thing this means that these new address types starting with a  won t be recognized by other bitcoin implementations such as blockchain info examples  show all supported commands and parser help show help for a specific command and parser allbalances help compute simple blockchain stats and parser simple extract all transactions for a very popular address dicewbxymyitheuagmpgecelg and parser transactions fbfacbffaeabf compute the closure of an address that is the list of addresses that very probably belong to the same person and parser closure fbfacbffaeabf compute and print the balance for all keys ever used since the beginning of time and parser all all txt see how much of the btc k pizza tainted all the subsequent tx in the chain chances are you have some dust coming from that famous tx lingering on one of your addresses and parser taint pizzataint txt see all the block rewards and fees and parser rewards rewards txt see a greatly detailed dump of the famous pizza transaction and parser show track all mined blocks with unspent reward and parser pristine show the first valid pay to script hash psh transaction in the chain and parser showtx cadbfdffbefcadafceeaf show the first valid naked multi sig transaction in the chain it s a  of  multi sig and parser showtx abdaaabbdecbeceeccdaabdebcdcbb note the general syntax is note use parser help command or parser command help to get detailed help for a specific command note command may have multiple aliases and can also be abbreviated for example parser tx  parser tr  and parser transactions are equivalent note whenever specifying a list of things e g a list of addresses  you can instead enter file list txt and the list will be read from the file note whenever specifying a list file you can use file and blockparser will read the list directly from stdin caveats  you will need an x  ubuntu box and a recent version of gcc    a recent version of boost and openssl dev you may be able to compile on other platforms but the code wasn t really designed for those as of this writing it needs a log of ram to work typically upwards of gigs i will switch to an on disk hash table at some point but for now you ll just need that if you ever hope to see it finish in a reasonable amount of time or at all if your swap space is too small the code could be cleaner and better architected it was just a quick and dirty way for me to learn about bitcoin there really isn t much in the way of comments either d otoh it is fairly simple short if you want to understand how the blockchain data structures work the code in parser cpp is a solid way to start hacking the code  parser cpp contains the generic parser that reads the blockchain parses it and calls user defined callbacks as it hits interesting bits of information it typically calls out when it begins reading finishes assembling a data structure util cpp contains a grab bag of useful bitcoin related routines interesting examples include showscript getbasereward solveoutputscript decompresspublickey blockparser comes with a bunch of interesting user callbacks cb and allbalances cpp code to all balance of all addresses cb and closure cpp code to compute the transitive closure of an address cb and dumptx cpp code to display a transaction in very great detail cb and help cpp code to dump detailed help for all other commands cb and pristine cpp code to show all pristine i e unspent blocks cb and rewards cpp code to show all block rewards including fees cb and simplestats cpp code to compute simple stats cb and sql cpp code to product an sql dump of the blockchain cb and taint cpp code to compute the taint from a given tx to all txs cb and transactions cpp code to extract all transactions pertaining to an address you can very easily add your own custom command you can use the existing callbacks in directory and cb and as a template to build your own cp cb and allbalances cpp cb and myextractor cpp add to makefile hack away recompile run you can also read the file callback h the base class from which you derive to implement your own new commands it has been heavily commented and should provide a good basis to pick what to overload to achieve your goal the code makes heavy use of the google dense hash maps you can switch it to use sparse hash maps see makefile search for dense undef it sparse hash maps are slower but save quite a bit of ram

29566981, lens stands for live editing of network streams lens is a framework that allows you to tap live cabling for inspection and injection lens in action docs and lens in action jpg defcon   slides docs and lensdefconslides pdf whitepaper docs and lenswhitepaper pdf are available in the docs and docs folder the wires of a network cable can be punched down into the lens tap board in two places without interrupting the packet flow the tap board then provides a redundant copper path through a set of relays once all of the wires have been punched down on both sides they can be cut so that the signals are now routed only through the relays on the tap board one or two additional nics are connected to the tap board on its tap ports these along with a usb link are connected to a computer the computer can command the relays over usb to assume either a passive or active tap topology or a transparent pass through mode the tap board has three safety features fail safe power loss heartbeat and tamper detection if the board detects that power has been lost it can optionally use the remaining energy stored in a large capacitor to revert the state of the relays to pass through mode alternatively if the board fails to receive a heartbeat from the computer within a specified amount of time such as if the computer software crashes it can revert the relays lastly the board has an accelerometer on it that can detect if the board is jostled or moved and report that to the computer this can give you peace of mind that your board is still in place and working the lens software was made to work nicely with the tap board but can be used without it simply connect two nics in a man in the middle configuration lens implements a software network stack designed for man in the middle attacks it is able to decode many protocols edit their data payloads and forge new packets containing the modified payloads that look as similar to the original ones as possible lens is single threaded and uses asynchronous i and o through tornado many operations are implemented as tornado coroutines network layers  the software is split into layers  each of which manages its own state and provides an abstraction for the layers above it these layers generally follow the standard osi model for instance ethernet  ipv  tcp  http  are some of the layers we have some layers are inherently stateful with respect to the data that is passed through them e g tcp  whereas others do not require any state to handle their data e g ipv however these layers may find it useful to maintain state in order to later forge packets layers are represented as subclasses of netlayer layers are chained together to form a doubly linked dag typically a tree  where each layer knows its parent parent and its children children that come above it in the stack for example an instance of ethernetlayer may have an ipvlayer in its children list that ipvlayer s parent would be a reference back to the ethernetlayer instance for the purposes of this document this kind of relationship will be described as ethernetlayer ipvlayer  even though the connection is in fact double ended and the layers are instances each layer subclassing netlayer should implement the following methods as tornado coroutines layer onread self src header payload this coroutine is called whenever there is new data payload available for the layer to process header is a dict which holds all of the information extracted from all of the previous layers with payload and header  it should be possible to completely reconstruct the original packet src represents where the data came from a simple onread might move some data from payload into header and call layer bubble src newheader subpayload to pass data to children layers layer write self dst header payload this coroutine is called to write out payload a simple write would take relevant parameters in header  re serialize them and combine them with payload to form a new payload it would then call layer writeback dst header newpayload to pass the back to the parent layer layer match self src header this function should return a boolean indicating whether this layer is capable of handling the given packet the default behavior if not overridden is to always return true  that is consume all data currently src and dst parameters represent which physical nic the message came from or is intended to go to netlayer implements two functions route src and unroute dst  which are intended to resolve the intended recipient of a packet this mechanism might need to be re worked for systems with  and nics currently the two nics are represented by  and   so the functions are equivalent although each netlayer should implement the methods above there are some additional helper methods and coroutines that are useful layer bubble self src header payload this coroutine will attempt to further decode a payload using this layer s children it will go through the list of children until it finds one whose match function returns true it will then call that child s onread function if no child matches it calls self write dst  resolving dst from src  at which point the program flow reverses direction this method is used to pass data on to higher layers for further decoding if no higher layer is available or connected it will re write loopback the data unchanged layer writeback self dst header payload this coroutine calls self parent write dst header payload it is for further encoding a payload using this layer s parent it can be thought of as the opposite of layer bubble layer passthru self src header payload this convenience coroutine will call self writeback dst with dst resolved from src

89018481, this repository covers how to prepare for machine learning interviews mainly in the format of questions answers asides from machine learning knowledge other crucial aspects include explain your resume explain your resume sql sql go directly to machine learning machine learning your resume should specify interesting ml projects you got involved in the past and quantitatively show your contribution consider the following comparison trained a machine learning system trained a deep vision system squeezenet that has  and  model size  and  training time  and  inference time and x faster convergence compared with traditional convnet e g  resnet we all can tell which one is gonna catch interviewer s eyeballs and better show case your ability in the interview be sure to explain what you ve done well spend some time going over your resume before the interview although you don t have to be a sql expert for most machine learning positions the interviews might ask you some sql related questions so it helps to refresh your memory beforehand some good sql resources are of the deep learning book which covers machine learning basics linear regression linear regression logistic regression logistic regression knn knn svm svm naive bayes decision tree decision tree bagging bagging random forest random forest boosting boosting stacking stacking clustering mlp mlp cnn cnn rnn and lstm rnn and lstm wordvec wordvec generative vs discriminative generative vs discriminative paramteric vs nonparametric paramteric vs nonparametric how to learn the parameter minimize the cost function how to minimize cost function gradient descent regularization l lasso can shrink certain coef to zero thus performing feature selection l ridge shrink all coef with the same proportion almost always outperforms l combined elastic net assumes linear relationship between features and the label can add polynomial and interaction features to add non linearity back to top machine learning generalized linear model glm for classification problems apply the sigmoid function to the output of linear models squeezing the target to range   threshold to make prediction if the output  prediction  otherwise prediction  a special case of softmax function which deals with multi class problem back to top machine learning given a data point we compute the k nearest data points neighbors using certain distance metric e g  euclidean metric for classification we take the majority label of neighbors for regression we take the mean of the label values note for knn technically we don t need to train a model we simply compute during inference time this can be computationally expensive since each of the test example need to be compared with every training example to see how close they are there are approximation methods can have faster inference time by partitioning the training data into regions note when k equals  or other small number the model is prone to overfitting high variance  while when k equals number of data points or other large number the model is prone to underfitting high bias back to top machine learning can perform linear nonlinear or outlier detection unsupervised large margin classifier not only have a decision boundary but want the boundary to be as far from the closest training point as possible the closest training examples are called the support vectors since they are the points based on which the decision boundary is drawn svms are sensitive to feature scaling back to top machine learning non parametric supervised learning algorithms given the training data a decision tree algorithm divides the feature space into regions for inference we first see which region does the test data point fall in and take the mean label values regression or the majority label value classification construction top down chooses a variable to split the data such that the target variables within each region are as homogeneous as possible two common metrics gini impurity or information gain won t matter much in practice advantage simply to understand interpret mirrors human decision making disadvantage can overfit easily and generalize poorly if we don t limit the depth of the tree can be non robust a small change in the training data can lead to a totally different tree instability sensitive to training set rotation due to its orthogonal decision boundaries back to top machine learning to address overfitting we can use an ensemble method called bagging bootstrap aggregating  which reduces the variance of the meta learning algorithm bagging can be applied to decision tree or other algorithms bagging is when samlping is performed with replacement when sampling is performed without replacement it s called pasting bagging is popular due to its boost for performance but also due to that individual learners can be trained in parallel and scale well ensemble methods work best when the learners are as independent from one another as possible voting soft voting predict probability and average over all individual learners often works better than hard voting out of bag instances  can act validation set for bagging back to top machine learning random forest improves bagging further by adding some randomness in random forest only a subset of features are selected at random to construct a tree while often not subsample instances the benefit is that random forest decorrelates the trees for example suppose we have a dataset there is one very predicative feature and a couple of moderately predicative features in bagging trees most of the trees will use this very predicative feature in the top split and therefore making most of the trees look similar and highly correlated averaging many highly correlated results won t lead to a large reduction in variance compared with uncorrelated results in random forest for each split we only consider a subset of the features and therefore reduce the variance even further by introducing more uncorrelated trees i wrote a notebook notebooks and bag rf var ipynb to illustrate this point in practice tuning random forest entails having a large number of trees the more the better but always consider computation constraint also minsamplesleaf the minimum number of samples at the leaf node to control the tree size and overfitting always cv the parameters feature importance in a decision tree important features are likely to appear closer to the root of the tree we can get a feature s importance for random forest by computing the averaging depth at which it appears across all trees in the forest back to top machine learning how it works boosting builds on weak learners and in an iterative fashion in each iteration a new learner is added while all existing learners are kept unchanged all learners are weighted based on their performance e g  accuracy  and after a weak learner is added the data are re weighted examples that are misclassified gain more weights while examples that are correctly classified lose weights thus future weak learners focus more on examples that previous weak learners misclassified difference from random forest rf rf grows trees in parallel  while boosting is sequential rf reduces variance while boosting reduces errors by reducing bias xgboost extreme gradient boosting xgboost uses a more regularized model formalization to control overfitting which gives it better performance back to top machine learning instead of using trivial functions such as hard voting to aggregate the predictions from individual learners train a model to perform this aggregation first split the training set into two subsets the first subset is used to train the learners in the first layer next the first layer learners are used to make predictions meta features on the second subset and those predictions are used to train another models to obtain the weigts of different learners in the second layer we can train multiple models in the second layer but this entails subsetting the original dataset into  parts back to top machine learning a feedforward neural network where we have multiple layers in each layer we can have multiple neurons and each of the neuron in the next layer is a linear and nonlinear combination of the all the neurons in the previous layer in order to train the network we back propagate the errors layer by layer in theory mlp can approximate any functions back to top machine learning the conv layer is the building block of a convolutional network the conv layer consists of a set of learnable filters such as    width height depth during the forward pass we slide or more precisely convolve the filter across the input and compute the dot product learning again happens when the network back propagate the error layer by layer initial layers capture low level features such as angle and edges while later layers learn a combination of the low level features and in the previous layers and can therefore represent higher level feature such as shape and object parts back to top machine learning rnn is another paradigm of neural network where we have difference layers of cells and each cell only take as input the cell from the previous layer but also the previous cell within the same layer this gives rnn the power to model sequence this seems great but in practice rnn barely works due to exploding and vanishing gradient which is cause by a series of multiplication of the same matrix to solve this we can use a variation of rnn called long short term memory lstm  which is capable of learning long term dependencies the math behind lstm can be pretty complicated but intuitively lstm introduce input gate output gate forget gate memory cell internal state lstm resembles human memory it forgets old stuff old internal state forget gate and learns from new input input node input gate back to top machine learning shallow two layer neural networks that are trained to construct linguistic context of words takes as input a large corpus and produce a vector space typically of several hundred dimension and each word in the corpus is assigned a vector in the space the key idea is context words that occur often in the same context should have same and opposite meanings two flavors continuous bag of words cbow the model predicts the current word given a window of surrounding context words skip gram predicts the surrounding context words using the current word back to top machine learning discriminative algorithms model p y and x w  that is given the dataset and learned parameter what is the probability of y belonging to a specific class a discriminative algorithm doesn t care about how the data was generated it simply categorizes a given example generative algorithms try to model p x and y  that is the distribution of features given that it belongs to a certain class a generative algorithm models how the data was generated given a training set an algorithm like logistic regression or the perceptron algorithm basically tries to find a straight line that is a decision boundary that separates the elephants and dogs then to classify a new animal as either an elephant or a dog it checks on which side of the decision boundary it falls and makes its prediction accordingly here s a different approach first looking at elephants we can build a model of what elephants look like then looking at dogs we can build a separate model of what dogs look like finally to classify a new animal we can match the new animal against the elephant model and match it against the dog model to see whether the new animal looks more like the elephants or more like the dogs we had seen in the training set back to top machine learning a learning model that summarizes data with a set of parameters of fixed size independent of the number of training examples is called a parametric model a model where the number of parameters is not determined prior to training nonparametric does not mean that they have no parameters on the contrary nonparametric models can become more and more complex with an increasing amount of data back to top machine learning

21301216, mpgnotification  mpgnotifications is an ios control that allows you to display in app interactive notifications that are fully customisable to suit your needs mpgnotification objects are uiview objects they are displayed on top of everything using self contained logic that grabs the level of the top most window as reported by uiapplciation you just initialize them configure them and show them that s it initializing an mpgnotification object is simple just use init or new obj c mpgnotification notification mpgnotification alloc init mpgnotification anothernotification mpgnotification new you may also use the following convenience method to initialize a notification with many of the basic visualization properties already set obj c mpgnotification easynotification mpgnotification notificationwithtitle greetings subtitle did you know we have notifications now backgroundcolor uicolor redcolor iconimage uiimage imagenamed radical after you have configured your notification it s easy to show it on screen because the mpgnotification discovers its own superview and location in the view hierarchy you simply need to call show obj c notification show however simply showing the notification can be limiting what if you want to take action when someone taps the notification if a user taps the background of a notification or one of the buttons you have configured you can take action in two ways you may set the buttonhandler property like so obj c notification buttonhandler mpgnotification notification nsinteger buttonindex if buttonindex notification firstbutton tag nslog user tapped the only button on screen notification show or you can simply show the notification with the following convenience method obj c and and easynotification

for showing mask on specified container when requesting such as add uiactivityindicatorview on uiviewcontroller s view when request begins and remove it when request ends object conforms to this protocol can be used by load method of datarequest maskable mask protocol for loadable  view that conforms to this protocol will be treated as mask containable container protocol for loadable  objects

customize the error configuration jsonerrorable error protocol for json data conforming to this protocol to customize the error configuration for json data mostly you don t need to care much about these protocols because we already have many default implementations for them however if you want to customize something you just need to conform to these protocols and do what you want here is some default implementations for these protcols loadtype enum that conforms to loadable protocol using case default container containable case to show maskview on the container when requesting uialertcontroller and messageable with this extension you can pass a uialertcontroller directly into the warn and inform method of datarequest uibutton and loadable with this extension you can pass a button directly into the load method of datarequest uitableviewcell and loadable with this extension you can pass a cell directly into the load method of datarequest uirefreshcontrol and loadable with this extension you can pass a uirefreshcontrol directly into the load method of datarequest uiprogressview and progressable with this extension you can pass a uiprogressview directly into the progress

 there is no need to inherit any object to get the features it has and you can extend any features you want without changing the code of bamboots itself  we have default extension for most of the protocol so you can easily startup  and if you have special needs extend or conform to it  the api was designed with the principles of alamofire so you can also extend it as bamboots already have done for you  mainly focus on things between business development and alamofire not network request itself for business development most of the requests headers are the same so you can extend it only for once swift extension formable public func headers string string return accesstoken xxx and you can also have extension for specified protocol swift extension formable where self uploadformable public func headers string string return accesstoken xxx  file xxx and for other parameters such as url  method  parameters etc each request will has it s own value so we create an object and make it

1852529, use leader b typically b to open a window listing all buffers in this window you can use normal movement keys to select a buffer and then enter to edit the selected buffer in the previous window c v to edit the selected buffer in a new vertical split c s to edit the selected buffer in a new horizontal split c t to edit the selected buffer in a new tab page use gb or m b and gb or m s b to flip through the most recently used buffer stack without opening the buffer listing drawer use leader left  leader up  leader right  leader down to split a new window left up right or down respectively and edit the previous mru buffer there many other options are supported e g open in existing window and tab or in the same window preview buffer without leaving buffer listing pin the buffer listing so that it is open all the time etc etc buffergator is a plugin for listing navigating between and selecting buffers to edit upon invocation using the command buffergatoropen or buffergatortoggle  or the provided key mapping leader b  a catalog of listed buffers are displayed in a separate new window split vertical or horizontal based on user options default vertical from this buffer catalog  a buffer can be selected and opened in an existing window a new window split vertical or horizontal  or a new tab page selected buffers can be previewed  i e opened in a window or tab page but with focus remaining in the buffer catalog even better you can walk up and down the list of buffers shown in the catalog by using c n or space and c p or c space these keys select the next and previous buffer in succession respectively opening it for preview without leaving the buffer catalog the buffer opening commands follow that of nerdtree examples use movement keys hjkl to select a buffer from the list then type cr or o to open it in the previous window type  and cr or o to open buffer number  in the previous window you can use go to open the currently selected buffer in the previous window but with focus remaining in the buffer catalog go will do the same but will select buffer number  you can use s to open the currently selected buffer in new vertical split s will open the buffer in a new vertical split but keep the focus in the buffer catalog s or s will do the same but will select buffer number  you can use i to open the currently selected buffer in new horizontal split i will open the buffer in a new vertical split but keep the focus in the buffer catalog i or i will do the same but will select buffer number  you can use t to open the currently selected buffer in new tab t will do the same but will select buffer number  to reduce strain on muscle memory the following ctrl p keymaps are also supported c v open in new vertical split c s open in new horizontal split c t open in new tab other key maps allow you to jump to a target buffer in an open window and split and tab page if it is already active there instead of creating a new window minimal management of buffers wiping and dropping are also provided buffergator also provides a way to list tab pages and buffers associated with windows in tab pages the tab page catalog  which can be invoked using the command buffergatortabsopen or the provided key mapping leader to the buffer listing can be sorted alphabetically by filename by full filepath by extension followed by filename or by most recently used mru by default buffergator provides global key maps that invoke its main commands leader b to open and leader b to close the buffer catalog and leader to to open and leader tc to close the tab page catalog in addition in normal mode from any buffer you can flip through the mru most recently used buffer list without opening the buffer catalog by using the gb or m b and gb or m s b keys or flip through the buffers in buffer number order by using b and b if you prefer to map other keys or do not want any keys mapped at all set g buffergatorsuppresskeymaps to  in your vimruntime note if you have other plugins installed that have key maps that start with leader b e g  bufexplorer which uses leader bs  leader bv  etc  then you may notice a slight delay or lag when typing the default leader b to start buffergator in this case you should either use another keymap for buffergator or bufexplorer detailed usage description given in the help file which can be viewed on line source code repository can be found here note there are many other plugins that provide similar functionality this plugin is very much in the bufexplorer and selectbuf vein in that it provides a full window buffer view of the buffers i wanted a plugin that a listed the loaded buffers in a optionally persistant drawer  b allowed me to preview buffers without leaving the drawer and c allowed me to walk up and down the list of buffers previewing them but without leaving the drawer none of the existing plugins did this as far as i know  and hence i rolled out this one the other plugins provide more functionality with respect to other operations e g  buffer management  that i did not have an immediate need for so i did not incorporate it into this plugin

15228198, mgtemplateengine  what is it  mgtemplateengine is a native cocoa system for generating text output based on templates and data it s a close cousin of systems like smarty freemarker django s template language and other such systems the default syntax for markers functions or language constructs is for  to  foo and for and the default syntax for variables and expressions is foo bar and uppercase the pipe character indicates a filter is being applied i e the value of foo bar will then be fed to the uppercase filter before being displayed you can apply filters to markers as well as variables the marker variable and filter delimiters are completely customizable so you re not stuck with the defaults if you prefer different syntax mgtemplateengine offers the following features native cocoa implementation it doesn t use the scripting bridge or any external runtimes and frameworks and as such the core engine itself has no requirements other than mac os x leopard very customizable it s very easy to define new markers like functions or language constructs and new filters data formatting capabilities you can also freely change the syntax of the markers and expressions to suit your own tastes or to mimic your favorite other templating system delegate system to keep you informed mgtemplateengine can optionally inform a delegate object of significant events during processing of a template including beginning and ending blocks or encountering errors global and template specific variables you can define a set of variables which exist for the lifetime of the engine and also specify variables which only apply to a certain template access variables using familiar key value coding kvc key paths with enhancements for example if you had an nsdictionary containing an nsarray for the key foo  and that array contained  nsdictionaries each of which had an nsstring for the key bar  you could access the value of the fifth dictionary s bar object using this syntax foo  bar remembering that array indices are zero based requirements  mgtemplateengine requires mac os x   leopard or later please see the included source code license file for the license this code is released under summary it s an attribution license credit me and you can freely use modify and redistribute in source or binary forms as you see fit closed source and commercial use is absolutely fine extensibility  mgtemplateengine offers  main types of extensibility as detailed below you should also read the included documents specific to each api for more details  markers you can create new markers which provide new tags for use in templates markers can be standalone or can be complex blocks like if else and if  can iterate and loop enable or disable output set new variables within their scope and much more  filters filters modify data for display purposes for example the built in dateformat filter which formats an nsdate as a string using a specified formatting definition you can easily write new filters to format and transform your data in new ways  matchers a matcher is a very important object which performs a conceptually simple task it finds the next marker or expression in a template and splits it into its components such as the marker name or variable extra arguments and any filter specified mgtemplateengine ships with two matchers which you can choose between or implement your own regexkitlite this matcher uses regexkitlite which is a thin wrapper on libicucore dylib included with mac os x   and later this matcher does not require any additional frameworks or libraries to be included in your application though you must of course link against libicucore the sample project does this regexkit this matcher uses regexkit which is a framework wrapping the pcre regular expressions library this matcher requires regexkit to be included in your application you can freely write your own matcher if you don t want to link against libicucore or don t want to include regexkit in your application for example you could write a matcher which uses nsscanner or one which uses ogrekit instead standard language features  all language features are implemented as plug in markers so you can freely inspect and modify how they work at time of writing mgtemplateengine supports the following constructs for x to y a standard for loop beginning at x and incrementing a loop variable each time through the loop until y is reached you can also append reversed to the command to go from the second value down to the first for p in q creates a new variable p which has each of the values in the collection q successively you can also append reversed to the command to go from last to first only works for ordered collections which supply a reverseobjectenumerator i e nsarray and its subclasses note both for constructs provide several useful variables during the body of the loop including currentloop currentindex currentloop startindex and so on including currentloop parentloop if appropriate if x and if x y else and if a standard if and if or if else and if conditional construct the arguments to the if statement are processed either as boolean truth values or numerical comparisons and can be x y x y same as x and y x y same as and x or y x and and y same as or x y x y x y x y x y returns false if x and y has no remainder otherwise true now creates an nsdate object for the current date and time literal begins a block of literal text within which no markers and expressions will be interpreted and will instead be echoed directly to the output ends with a and literal marker comment with no arguments begins a block comment which ends upon encountering and comment with  or more arguments this is treated as a self contained comment section begins a named block of the template when combined with the delegate methods for being informed of blocks beginning and ending this is useful for being notified of the position and length of certain named blocks in a template perhaps for extraction and further processing load takes a space separated list of classnames and will attempt to load them as markers and filters as appropriate the classes will only be instantiated if they exist and if they implement either the mgtemplatemarker or mgtemplatefilter protocol as appropriate and if they haven t already been loaded cycle takes a space separate list of arguments can be quoted if they contain whitespace  which will be alternated between each time the cycle marker is visited this is useful within a loop for outputting the next in a set of values each time for example for alternating row colors or such set takes two arguments the first being a variable name and the second being a value to set that variable to note remember that variables are scoped within the current block by default so if you want a variable to survive outwith the current block you should set it to an initial value in the template variables or global variables before beginning to process the template standard data filters  there are a few standard filters currently included with mgtemplateengine and you can easily add your own the standard ones are uppercase lowercase capitalized returns a string representation of the value case transformed as appropriate dateformat takes a string with formatting characters to format an nsdate object for example obtained via the now marker the formatting system used is nsdateformatter in   and mode i e as detailed here colorformat takes a string representing the format to convert the given nscolor object to the only currently support value is hex  which provides a web suitable  digit rrggbb hexadecimal representation of the color if it could be converted to rgb and black otherwise feature requests and bug reports  i hope you enjoy using mgtemplateengine matt legend gemmell

72773853, lightbulb is an open source python framework for auditing web application firewalls and filters the framework consists of two main algorithms gofa an active learning algorithm that infers symbolic representations of automata in the standard membership and equivalence query model active learning algorithms permits the analysis of filter and sanitizer programs remotely i e given only the ability to query the targeted program and observe the output sfadiff a black box differential testing algorithm based on symbolic finite automata sfa learning finding differences between programs with similar functionality is an important security problem as such differences can be used for fingerprinting or creating evasion attacks against security software like web application firewalls wafs which are designed to detect malicious inputs to web applications web applications firewalls wafs are fundamental building blocks of modern application security for example the pci standard for organizations handling credit card transactions dictates that any application facing the internet should be either protected by a waf or successfully pass a code review process nevertheless despite their popularity and importance auditing web application firewalls remains a challenging and complex task finding attacks that bypass the firewall usually requires expert domain knowledge for a specific vulnerability class thus penetration testers not armed with this knowledge are left with publicly available lists of attack strings like the xss cheat sheet which are usually insufficient for thoroughly evaluating the security of a waf product in this presentation we introduce a novel efficient approach for bypassing wafs using automata learning algorithms we show that automata learning algorithms can be used to obtain useful models of wafs given such a model we show how to construct either manually or automatically a grammar describing the set of possible attacks which are then tested against the obtained model for the firewall moreover if our system fails to find an attack a regular expression model of the firewall is generated for further analysis using this technique we found over  previously unknown vulnerabilities in popular wafs such as mod security phpids and expose allowing us to mount sql injection and xss attacks bypassing the firewalls finally we present lightbulb an open source python framework for auditing web applications firewalls using the techniques described above in the release we include the set of grammars used to find the vulnerabilities

ubuntu debian sudo apt get install flex sudo apt get install python pip sudo apt get install python dev sudo apt get install build essential optional for apt if you want to add support for mysql testing sudo apt get install libmysqlclient dev for yum platforms centos redhat fedora with already installed the extra packages repo epel release sudo yum install y python pip sudo yum install y python devel sudo yum install y wget sudo yum groupinstall y development tools optional for yum if you want to add support for mysql testing sudo yum install y mysql devel sudo yum install y mysql python in order to use the application without complete package installation cd lightbulb framework lightbulb status in order to perform complete package installation you can also install it from pip repository this requires first to install the latest setuptools version pip install setuptools upgrade pip install lightbulb framework lightbulb status if you want to use virtualenv pip install virtualenv virtualenv env source env and bin and activate pip install lightbulb framework lightbulb status the lightbulb status command will guide you to install mysqldb and openfst support if you use virtualenv in linux the sudo command will be required only for the installation of libmysqlclient dev package it should be noted that the lightbulb status command is not necessary if you are going to use the burp extension the reason is that this command installs the openfst and mysql bindings and the extension by default is using jython which does not support c bindings it is recommended to use the command only if you want to change the burp extension configuration from the settings and enable the native support it is also possible to use a docker instance docker pull lightbulb and lightbulb framework the extension is already available in the bapp store you can directly install lightbulb by navigating at the burp extender tab you can also use the following steps to install the latest version of the extension from this repository manually in burp first it is recommended to increase the available memory for burp using the following command java jar xmxm and path and to and burpbinary also lightbulb uses the native binary of flex parser as a result it is recommended to install flex before using the tool in debian system it can be installed with the following command apt install flex then you have to setup a working environment with burp proxy and jython find your local python packages installation folder configure burp extender to use these values as shown below select the new lightbulb module burpextension py and set the extension type to be python the latest jython   x is supported however mysql differential learning may still require an older version eg

40702784, pipecat allows you to scale any program supporting the fack contract fack contract but with message acknowledgments seq   and pipecat publish numbers pipecat consume numbers autoack and xargs n  expr  and pipecat publish results pipecat consume results autoack non blocking and python cu import sys print sum map int sys stdin pipecat supports a local mode and all amqp    message brokers you can download a single binary for linux osx or windows chmod and x pipecat and pipecat help linux chmod and x pipecat and pipecat help install from source go get github com and lukasmartinelli and pipecat if you are using windows or  bit architectures you need to download the appropriate binary pipecat connects message queues and unix pipes the need arose when i started building messaging support into utilities in order to make them scalable but still wanted to leave my programs the way they are without heavy dependencies and still be able to scale the process reliably in this example we will calculate the sum of a sequence of numbers specify the amqpuri env var to connect to the message broker export amqpuri amqp and and user pass host  and vhost let s create a new queue numbers and publish a sequence of numbers from  to  seq   and pipecat publish numbers multiply the input sequence with factor  and publish the results to an additional results queue this step can be run on multiple hosts we want to acknowledge all received messages automatically with autoack pipecat consume numbers autoack and xargs n  expr  and pipecat publish results now let s sum up all the numbers because we want to end after receiving all numbers we specify the non blocking mode which will close the connection if no messages have been received after a timeout pipecat consume results autoack non blocking and python cu import sys print sum map int sys stdin if you do not have an existing amqp broker at hand you can run rabbitmq in a docker container expose the ports and connect to it docker run d p   hostname pipecat rabbit name pipecat rabbit rabbitmq  now connect to localhost with the default guest login export amqpuri amqp and and guest guest localhost  and if you are using existing message queue infrastructure you can also publish messages to an exchange with the first parameter used as the routing key thanks to kennon for the implementation seq   and pipecat publish exchange myexchange no create queue my routing key the amqpexchange environment variable can also be used export amqpexchange myexchange we already have written a small concise and very scalable set of programs we can now run the multiply py step on many servers however if the server dies while multiply py is running the input lines already processed are lost if your program needs that ability you need to implement the fack contract fack contract  demonstrated for the multiply py sample any program that accepts output from stdin and writes to stdout should accept an environment variable fack containing a file descriptor if a single operation performed on a line from stdin was successful  that line should be written to fack fack contract flow diagrams and fackcontract png implementing the contract is straightforward  support the optional fack environment variable containing a file name  write the received input into this file handle if we performed the operation successfully on it below is a python example multiply py which multiplies the sequence of numbers as above but writes the input line to stdack if successfully processed python import sys import os with open os getenv fack  os devnull  w as stdack works even if fack is not set for line in sys stdin num int line strip result num  sys stdout write n format result stdack write line ack the processed line stdack flush make sure line does not get lost in the buffer now your program can no longer lose messages with pipecat because you can feed the fack output back into pipecat which will only then acknowledge the messages from the message queue pipecat flow diagram diagrams and pipecatflow png fill the queue again seq   and pipecat publish numbers and use a named pipe to funnel the acknowledged input lines back into mkfifo ack cat ack and pipecat consume numbers and fack ack python u multiply py and pipecat publish results consume all messages to reduce a result in the reduce operation we need to autoack all received messages because we can t possibly hold the entire result set in memory until the operation has performed pipecat consume results autoack non blocking and python cu import sys print sum map int sys stdin with a few lines additional code only depending on the standard library you can now make any program in any language scalable using message queues without any dependencies and without changing the behavior bit pipecat consume results autoack non blocking resultsbackup json cat resultsbackup json and pipecat publish results binaries for windows osx and linux docker run rm v pwd and usr and src and pipecat w and usr and src and pipecat tcnksm and gox    light
