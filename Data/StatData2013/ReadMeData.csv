the end of  after that time however support will be on a best effort basis and eventually phased out in favor of the nd edition thanks for your interest in this project twitter is retiring v of its api that the examples in this book were based upon the print and ebook copies that are in circulation are not updated to reflect the new v  twitter api but as a stop gap measure ipython notebooks and standard python exports of those notebooks are now checked in for chapters   and  which feature twitter data you can view read only version of these notebooks if you re interested reach out on the facebook page or twitter with any questions or concerns that you may have let me be the first to tell you that you could find pirated copies of this book online before it was even in stock on amazon but i implore you not to go to those places and get it in the end everybody really ends up losing if you steal ebooks because it kills the supply chain at its roots stripping the motivation right out of authors and other original and creative content producers who work hard to bring you interesting content that takes a lot of energy to produce here are lots of reasons not to steal this book all of the source code is already being given away right here as a convenient github project do whatever you want with it if these reasons don t provide enough information for you to make an informed decision about whether or not spending  is a good investment and that there are ample alternatives to casual copying  then please send me a message and tell me what it would take to convince you i d love to chat about it and hear your thoughts popular social networks such as facebook twitter and linkedin generate a tremendous amount of valuable social data who s talking to whom what are they

1096127, depthjs is an open source browser extension and plugin currently working for chrome that allows the microsoft kinect to talk to any web page it provides the low level raw access to the kinect as well as high level hand gesture events to simplify development current status  windows plugin now works with chrome use firebreath to build see instructions below  or try to use the precompiled version but then you must rename and copy chrome extension and manifest json win to chrome extension and manifest json moving to firebreath npapi plugins for chrome and firefox mac and safari version remains as it is under webkit plugin mac and safari extension mac mac version of the new npapi plugin already exists for chrome tested and working you should just be able to go on to chrome and and extensions and add it to your browser now working on linux and windows support moving to openni and nite based backend forsaking opencv for now gesture recognition is thus far better than what we had before finger based gestures will soon follow as a few projects parallel to depthjs will merge in coming months wave to start hand tracking and get blue pointer push to click circle to end tracking and remove blue pointer note openni nite should be downloaded and linked appropriately to your build components  depthjs is very modular the kinect driver and computer vision are written on top of openni and nite this component can output the raw rgb image the raw depth map filtered for the hand  as well as the high level events that the computer vision recognizes a native browser plugin think flash wraps this kinect code which directly interacts with a javascript browser plugin fortunately in chrome extensions can contain native code so it will be easy for anyone to install it safari requires a bit more work with a plugin installer needing to go to the extension store if apple will even permit this event handlers in the browser extension may be placed globally in content scripts injected into each web page or pushed via the content script to local dom elements written by rd parties flow diagram kinect browser plugin and native code browser extension javascript and dom events any web page note as of now we are using openni and nite for tracking and gesture rec platforms  macs are supported all dependencies are statically compiled and in the repo except openni and nite who don t provide static libs linux should compile nicely although we don t distribute pre compiled dependencies for it yet windows now works for chrome through the firebreath plugin firefox to follow but internet explorer will probably not be supported unless someone would like to create an activex plugin out of the firebreath framework prerequisites mac and linux make sure you have the following directory existing and writeable and var and lib and ni and install each openni in order library using the install script mac and linux you may want to change the install directories to and usr and local and instead of and usr and check that all the modules are registered nireg l  info new log started on        info openni version is    build  macosx dec       info filter info minimum severity none openni version is     registered modules compiled with openni     script openni and openni and     and usr and local and lib and libxnvfeatures dylib compiled with openni     scene primesense and

with openni     device primesense and sensorkinect and     if everything is installed properly you should be able to run the nite examples chrome extensions support native code which needs to be compiled now under firebreath plugin and you must have cmake   and installed openni and nite cd depthjsdir and firebreath plugin and firebreathdir and prepmac sh build and make sure you run this from the depthjs and firebreath plugin directory open build and firebreath xcodeproj at the point xcode will open build the project and you should be all set cd depthjsdir and firebreath plugin and firebreathdir and prep cmd build and optionally set dopenniincludedirs  dopennilibs  dniteincludedirs and dnitelibs start build firebreath sln at this point visual studio will open and you should be able to compile the plugin visual studio is a prerequisite the chrome extension is located in chrome extension and the plugin is precompiled under chrome extension and plugin and go on chrome and and extensions and use load upacked extension to manually load depthjs as an extension use the chrome extension directory  and you should be good to go use the error console to fish for errors safari is no longer the active development browser because in   apple changed the policy for npapi plugins so they cannot be run as a singleton in the background help us create a ff extension around the firebreath npapi plugin future work  in addition to the obvious improvements to our gesture recognition we need to make the install process easier for end users most of our concern is to make everything truly cross platform cross browser and make this an open source reference implementation of a kinect browser plugin one click install is at second priority right now so if anyone wants to pitch in and do this they are welcome

4467848, environment without calling out to an external process phantomjs is run as an external process that users can run under any language however one must create a fancy glue wrapper so that development isn t impaired i created something that does exactly what phantomjs is capable of doing except in a full js environment called chimera installing is simple via npm npm install chimera it will download the native chimera binary in the postinstall script currently we have binaries for bit darwin mac  and bit linux if you use something different you may have to compile your own or wait for me to build one for your platform the most basic skeleton should look something like this var chimera require chimera chimera var c new chimera c perform locals run function callback callback null success callback function err result when you instantiate a new chimera with new chimera  you re actually creating a new browser instance which does not share session data with other browser sessions it has it s own in memory cookie database and url history the locals hash should contain variables you wish to pass to the web page these values should be types that can be turned into json because the sandboxing environment of the browser s js engine prevents us from passing actual nodejs variable references the run function is run immediately as the page is loaded you may wish to wait until the entire page is loaded before you perform your logic so you d have to do the same stuff that you d do in normal javascript embedded in webpages for example if you were using jquery you d be doing the standard document ready function stuff type of code to wait for the page to fully load keep in mind that the run function is run inside the webpage so you won t have access to any scoped variables in nodejs the callback parameter should be called when you re ready to pause the browser instance and pass control back to the nodejs world the callback function is run in the nodejs context so you ll have access to scoped variables as usual this function is called when you call the callback function from inside of run var c new chimera useragent mozilla and   windows nt   applewebkit and   khtml like gecko chrome and     safari and    librarycode function window myspecialvariable   cookies  disableimages true here are all the possible options available when creating a new browser instance useragent any string that represents a user agent by default it uses the one shown in the example a windows chrome browser librarycode if you want to inject jquery into all your webpages you should do something like fs readfilesync jquery js here cookies as seen in later examples you can save the cookies from a previous browser instance and use them here disableimages if you don t need images in your scraper this can drastically reduce memory and speed up webpages however your screenshots may look like crap in the example code below we show how to login to a website using a native mouse button click on the submit button then load a second browser instance using the logged in cookies from the first browser instance var chimera require chimera chimera var myusername myusername var mypassword mypassword var c new chimera c perform locals username myusername password mypassword run function callback and and find the form fields and press submit pos jquery login button offset window chimera sendevent click  pos left and  pos top and  callback function err result and and capture a screen shot c capture screenshot png and and save the cookies and close out the browser session var cookies c cookies c close and and create a new browser session with cookies from the previous session var c new chimera cookies cookies  c perform run function callback and and you re logged in here  callback function err result and and capture a screen shot that shows we re logged in c capture screenshotloggedin png c close   in the example above you may notice window chimera sendevent the chimera variable is a global inside webpages and allow you to call functions that you otherwise wouldn t be able to you can take a screenshot with chimera capture for when we are in the callback for the first browser instance we nab the cookies via c cookies if you inspect the cookies you ll see that it s just a giant string containing the domain keys and values this may contain http https cookies as well which are normally not accessible via javascript from inside the webpage you ll also probably notice there are cookies from tracking companies like google analytics or mixpanel the cookies string will basically contain everything that a browser may have if you want to remove the google analytics cookies you ll have to parse the cookie string and remove them manually yourself there are many cookie parsers out there check out the one that is included in the expressjs middleware if you need something quick and dirty here s a few things that you should not do var c new chimera var fs require fs c perform locals fs fs run function callback var os require os callback function err result in the above example we try to pass the fs variable as a local variable we can t do this because fs cannot be turned into a json string just because it looks like it might work it won t the sandbox in the web browser prevents scoped variables from being available a second thing wrong is that the run function doesn t perform the callback function with callback if you do this the context will never be passed back to the nodejs world so you ll be wondering why you can t scrape anything the third thing wrong here is that inside the run function we re trying to call require os the require function pulls from the nodejs scoped context which isn t available inside the webpage you only have access to typical variables in a webpage like window document etc since this library does use native libraries i may not have a native version for your platform people have been asking me about arm linux and sunos hopefully i can describe how one can compile this under your platform and perhaps we can move to something easier getting a binary on the mac is fairly easy but it does take a long time to compile qt unlike linux you don t need the custom openssl included with chimera here s the basic steps to take the mac and scripts and compileqt sh and scripts and compilebinary sh the final binary should be inside of node chimera and lib you ll need the ssl headers freetype and fontconfig libraries first so you ll have to install with a command like apt get install libfreetype dev libfontconfig dev libssl dev since nodejs comes with it s own version of ssl we have to make qt also use this version of ssl or else we ll have segfaults compile the openssl included first we have some additional flags like fpic which allow the libraries to be statically included later on here are all the steps required to build chimera and scripts and compileopenssl sh and scripts and compileqt sh and scripts and compilebinary sh the final chimera node binary should exist inside the node chimera and lib directory if you don t see it in there something bad probably happened along the way

matching to javascript npm install matches var pattern require matches pattern var mymap pattern  function return f x xs function f x xs return f x concat mymap f xs and and     mymap function x return x       check for specific values using number or string literals null  or undefined var myfn pattern and and null null function  and and undefined undefined function  and and numbers  function    function  e and  function  and and strings foo function  and and escape sequences must be double escaped this string n matches n newlines function underscores will match successfully on any value but ignore it var myfn pattern and and match if second argument is  ignoring the first   function patterns that start with lowercase letters will pass the value to the function values are passed to the function in the same right to left order they are declared in the pattern var myfn pattern and and pass on the second argument if the first is   x function x  and and pass on the first and third argument ignoring the second x  y function x y use an ellipsis for rest arguments a single ellipsis works as a catch all var myfn pattern and and match if first argument is  get all the rest as an array  args function args  and and get the last argument  x function x  and and match on anything and any number of arguments function match on the entire array or only a few values var myfn pattern and and empty array function  and and strict comparison on contents    function  and and grab the first value ignoring the rest x function x  and and split it into a head and tail head tail function head tail  and and grab the first and last items ignoring the middle x  y function x y  and and grab the last item  last function last  and and make a shallow clone clone function clone  and and grab the first item but also pass on the whole array arr first function arr first rests can do more than just split up an array you can combine them with arbitrary patterns to apply said pattern across every element in the array var myfn pattern and and make sure every element is a string string function  and and extract values from tuples x y function xs ys  and and extract values from objects name function names  and and you can even nest rest expressions head tail function heads tails like with an array you can match on an entire object or just a few keys unlike arrays matching is only non strict it checks that the keys exist but other keys are allowed to exist in the object var myfn pattern and and empty object function  and and check that an object has two keys x and y  and pass to the function x y function x y  and and check that an object has a key children that contains an array children a b function a b  typecheck arguments using number  string  date  regexp  function  array  or object var myfn pattern and and takes a function and an array fn function arr array function fn arr  and and takes a function and an object fn function obj object function fn obj you can add pattern matching support for your own classes and and create a new class function myclass this val  and and matches js will check for the non standard attribute name on the constructor and and function if you are in the browser and want wider support or are using and and anonymous functions make sure you tag your constructor with classname myclass classname myclass and and add the static method unapply for array like matching myclass unapply function obj return obj val and and add the static method unapplyobj for object like matching myclass unapplyobj function obj return val obj val and and now you can match on your object var myfn pattern and and type checking myclass function  and and array like matching myclass a function a  and and object like matching myclass val a function a adt js ships with builtin support for matches js adt js is a library for building algebraic data types or case classes in javascript and and create a new adt js type var tree adt data empty adt single  node adt record val  left  right var mytree tree node  tree empty tree node  tree empty tree empty var myfn pattern and and match on an empty tree node empty function  and and match on a node with a value of  node  function  and and match using named keys node val  function  and and match on a node that has non empty children node  node node function and and match on a node that has a left child node of  and an empty right node node val node     empty function val extend matches js with custom extractors and and naive email extractor and and extractors are passed the value and a pass function in order to count as and and a successful match the extractor must return an instance of pass matches extractors email function val pass if typeof val string val indexof  var parts val split return pass user parts   domain parts  var myfn pattern and and extractors are called by prefixing the name with a email x function x  and and match on the extracted value email x domain foo com function x matches js exports four functions pattern  caseof  extract  and extractone var matches require matches var pattern matches pattern var caseof matches caseof var extract matches extract var extractone matches extractone the simplest way is to give it an object with the keys being patterns and the values being functions each pattern will be tried in order until a match is var arrayelems pattern function return this array is empty x function x return this array has one element and x x y function x y return this array has two elements and x and and and y x y function x y return this array is long the first two elements are and x and and and y arrayelems    you can create individual pattern and function pairs var emptyarray pattern  function return empty array and and empty array emptyarray and and typeerror all patterns exhausted emptyarray  you can also create your own custom pattern functions the patternfn takes an array of arguments and should return false for no match or a new array of arguments to forward on to the successfn var greater function args if args   return args  return false var custompattern pattern greater function x console log x and and logs  custompattern  and and typeerror all patterns exhausted custompattern  you can use caseof to do ad hoc pattern matching on objects it s the same as immediately invoking a pattern function but lets you put the arguments var result caseof  x number function x return x    function return null and and is the same as var result pattern use extract to pull values out of other values it works much like match on strings if there was a succesful match it will return an array of extracted values if the match failed it will return null var res extract name  objarray this is like extract but returns the first value instead of an array this works well for traversing a deep structure var val extractone some nested structure val  obj note this will also return undefined on failure so keep that in mind if undefined could be a valid value you can combine any of these methods to create unique match chains using the alt combinator var wildcard pattern   function return no matches var mychain pattern   function return one  function return two   function return three alt wildcard mychain  mychain  and and no matches mychain  separate matches for multiple arguments with a comma since you can pass any number of arguments to functions in javascript matches js is not strict and will happily combine patterns for varying numbers of arguments however matches js is strict on the number of arguments within the pattern var myfn pattern and and matches on exactly three arguments  foo  a function a return a  and and matches on the first two arguments ignoring the rest a fn function function a fn return fn a  and and matches anything function return null pattern strings are compiled to pure javascript functions and then cached so in general they are quite fast on a ghz core average compilation time is around ms for a pattern comprised of   sub patterns pattern matched functions are around  x slower to dispatch than an equivalent hand optimized function that does similar type checking keep in mind that time is measured in the single microseconds s vs s to dispatch  calls to the same function

1661426, we deprecated haibu on th of august  we hosted a goodbye party and all that to be honest no tears were shed we moved to an agentless infrastrucure described in detail in haibu is dead long live haibu spawn your own node js clouds on your own hardware haibu doesn t discriminate if your environment supports node js you can install haibu and start up your own node js cloud this makes haibu an ideal tool for both development purposes and production usage since you can seamlessly setup haibu on your local machine on utility computing providers such as amazon ec or rackspace  on dedicated servers or even on a mobile phone sudo npm install haibu g sudo node bin and haibu haibu started     on port  as api server now that there is a haibu server running we can begin to interact with it s

this means that it will pull files from outside of the server in order to deploy instead of using uploading directly into the process the name attribute is required and will represent the name of the application being deployed name app name the user attribute is required and will represent the user who started up a drone user myusername this type of repository will pull a git repository into haibu and deploy its contents repository type git  this type of repository will pull a directory relative to the haibu and deploy its contents repository type local  directory and path and to and application this type of repository will pull a remote archive relative to the haibu and deploy its contents repository type tar  this type of repository will pull a remote archive relative to the haibu and deploy its contents repository type zip  this type of repository will install a npm package as application the package will be available as directory under its name and the scripts will be installed in the bin directory so scripts start should have one of both as relative directory scripts start bin and server js scripts start name of npm package and server js repository type npm  package name of npm package all of the haibu tests are written in vows   and cover all of the use cases described above npm test if you wish to take advantage of all of the configuration offered in haibu through flatiron see the sample test config json example  configuration file if you copy and paste the above link the test suite will attempt to connect to rackspace for some of the remote file tests you don t need to run these tests or use rackspace to get started we ll be improving our test runner soon to help make this process a bit more intuitive jitsu is intended to work with the full production stack at nodejitsu and should not be used with haibu

11622326,  maestro provides the ability to easily launch orchestrate and manage mulitple docker containers as single unit container sets are defined in a simple yaml format that allows you to define how the containers should be created and to specify relationships between containers the intention is to make easy to create and use complex multi node container envionments for testing and development this is what it currently looks like to use maestro and deploy a multi tier node js and mongodb application all that s required is a maestro yml in the root of the repository cd express todo example maestro build building template mongodb building template nodejs launching instance of template mongodb named mongodb starting container mongodb afcad starting nodejs waiting for service mongodb on ip     and port  found service mongodb on ip     and port  launching instance of template nodejs named nodejs starting container nodejs beac launched maestro ps id node command status ports afcad mongodb and usr and bin and mongod config and etc and mongodb conf running beac nodejs and usr and bin and node and var and www and app js running   maestro stop stopping container mongodb afcad stopping container nodejs beac maestro start starting container mongodb afcad starting nodejs waiting for service mongodb on ip     and port  found service mongodb on ip     and port  starting container nodejs beac early development it can be useful for testing and development but the feature set and configuration format are changing rapidly note this project used to be called dockermix build and start and stop and destroy multi container docker environments via simple commands specify dependencies between containers so they start in order and wait for services to become available automatically configure dependent containers to know where to locate services from other containers in the same environment easily launch and manage multiple copies of the same environment declarative yaml format to specify container configurations for the environment easily launch multiple instances of the same container for testing cluster operations share data between the host machine and containers running in the environment much more to come dependencies  python pip package manager installation  note docker    changed from listening on a network socket to listening on a unix socket due to a security issue at this time to use maestro with docker    you must re enable the tcp socket in docker and usr and bin and docker d h tcp and and      this is safe if you re running docker inside a vm dedicated to that purpose but not if you re running docker directly on your physical computer this will be fixed in the future sudo apt get install y python pip cd maestro sudo pip install r requirements txt sudo python setup py install docker pull ubuntu configuration file format  note this format is changing heavily the configuration file defines an environment that is made up of multiple templates that can be used to generate containers the templates can have relationships defined between them to specify start order and maestro will handle starting instances of the templates in containers in the correct order and then providing environment configuration to the containers this example will setup two templates one for nodejs and one for mongodb the nodejs template depends on mongodb so that when you start the environment no nodejs containers will be started until a mongdb container is fully up and running in this instance the templates are built from repositories stored on github but there are various ways to set these up templates nodejs config command and usr and bin and node and var and www and app js ports  environment port  buildspec url github com and toscanini and docker nodejs require mongodb port  mongodb config command and usr and bin and mongod config and etc and mongodb conf buildspec url github com and toscanini and docker mongodb to build and launch an environment you just place this config in a file named maestro yml then run maestro build it will take a few seconds to start as it waits for mongodb to initialize currently the environment state lives in the current directory but that will have more flexibility in the future templates also define a basic docker configuration so that you can pre define the parameters used on docker run baseimage is the docker container to use to run the command it must already exist on the system and won t be pulled automatically baseimage and command are the only required options if no buildspec is provided if buildspec is provided baseimage can be omitted require is used to specify dependencies between services the start order will be adjusted and any container that requires a port on a another container will wait for that port to become available before starting mount allows you to define bind mounts between a directory on the host and a directory in a container this allows you to share files between the host and the container note if you define a bind mount on a template then every instance of that template will mount the same host directory this example yaml file shows how some of the docker parameters look templates testserver baseimage ubuntu mount and host and path and container and path config ports  command and bin and bash c apt get install netcat nc l  k hostname testserver user root detach true stdinopen true tty true memlimit  environment envvar testing dns         volumes and var and testing note command is required by the docker python api and having to specify it here can cause problems with images that pre define entrypoints and commands command line tools the command line tool is called maestro and initial enironments are defined in maestro yml if there is a maestro yml in the current directory it will be automatically used otherwise the f option can be used to specify the location of the file the environment state will be saved to a file named environment yml and commands that manipulate existing environments will look for an environment yml in the current directory or it can be specified by the e option if you want to create a named environment you can use n to set the name and it will be made a global environment that lives either under and maestro or and var and lib and maestro depending on your setup maestro build setup a new environment using a maestro yml specification maestro start nodename start an existing environment that had been previously stopped and saved in environment yml if nodename is provided just that node will be stopped maestro stop nodename stop all containers in an environment and save the state to environment yml if nodename is provided just that node will be stopped maestro run template commandline run a new instance of the template in the environment limited functionality on this currently maestro destroy destroy all containers defined in an environment once destroyed the containers can not be recoved maestro ps show the status of the containers in an environment bootstrap installer add the ability to share configuration data between containers limited capabilities exist for this currently explicitly specify startup order and dependencies more powerful docker builder support currently docker py reimplements docker builder and it out of sync with the server implementation add automatic pulling of base images make it easier to run the full test suite add the ability to depend on external services add the ability to have named global environments as well as environments stored in the local directory more robust support for running and adding containers to an existing environment direct build and instantiation of an environment from a git repo

2142550, zynga viewporter v   viewporter is a open source javascript project by zynga to ease mobile viewport management it specifically simplifies the part of setting up the right screen dimensions and removes the pain from handling the viewport meta tag manually what does it do  when put into the header of a page and when running a mobile device viewporter will first try to scroll away any url or debug bars to maximize the visible window and then substracts the remaining chrome and ui height from the window effectively removing ugly scrollbars along the way it will also track orientationchange thus you will always have a maximized viewing experience how to use  in v all you had to to was to put viewporter into the head of the page there s just a little bit more to do in v but it isn t painful that s it really feel free to have a look at the demo pages if something doesn t work as expected what s wrong with doing it manually  proportional device height doesn t subtract the chrome height so the window is always larger than the viewport when set causing scrollbars even on empty pages rotating the device will cause the page to zoom as device width isn t inverted on rotation even with a manually fixed viewport there s a stupid gap at the bottom of the page when using absolutely positioned elements advantages of using viewporter  so what s in it for you there s a couple of automatic advantages for you when the viewporter is running here s a list maximized viewport scrolling away unneeded ui easy layouting easy layouting  yep take a lt div gt  position it absolutely set its width and height to   left and bottom to  and the background to any color with viewporter enabled it will be placed at the bottom left corner of the window and stretch to the middle of the window sounds obvious right it isn t really when you want a maximized window viewporter is almost zero configuration there s only one constant to check if viewporter is in fact running a convienience method to detect landscape orientation and a smart ready callback function in addition there s a couple of events you will likely want to use viewporter forcedetection boolean defaults to false enabling it will cause the viewporter not to use its profiles for devices see devicepixel demo viewporter preventpagescroll boolean defaults to false enabling it will prevent scroll events on the body element use this option to cancel ios overscroll effect which causes the view to bounce back when scrolling exceeds the bounds additionally it will scroll back the pane if the user clicks the page after selecting the address bar on ios viewporter active true if the viewporter is enabled and running smartphones  false if not desktop non touch device viewporter ready true when the viewportready function has already been fired useful if you re lazy loading initializing code viewporter islandscape returns wether the device is rotated to landscape or not viewporter ready accepts a callback and fires it when the viewporter has been successfully executed viewporter refresh refreshes the viewport this is eg useful when the browser displays an inline confirmations such as the geolocation alert on android hint listen for resize events and then call this method all events fire as native events on the window object viewportready fires as soon as the viewporter has been executed for the first time viewportchange fires when the viewport changes i e the device is rotated and after viewporter has been executed again

3606843, a redis like wrapper for javascript data storage using localstorage as the default persistent data store modern browsers provide a native javascript localstorage object which acts as a simple client side key value store per origin currently storage is limited to mb and can only store strings as values integers floats and booleans are coerced into strings upon save steroids it provides many more capabilities than just simple key value bankersbox aims to bring redis like apis and behavior to the client side using localstorage as the default data backing mechanism you can store strings arrays and javscript objects in bankersbox behind the scenes bankersbox transparently uses json stringify and json parse to save and restore non string values to their original types bankersbox uses a pluggable storage adapter system so that other methods may be used to persist and restore data other than with localstorage see the storage adapters section below bankersbox is not a redis client it is only meant to be a storage abstraction with redis like apis and behaviors for those familiar with the redis way if you are looking for a javascript redis client e g for use with node js please turn back now like redis bankersbox has the concept of databases which are just stores with different index numbers bankersbox takes the id of the store you wish to use in the constructor each id maps to a different store so if you set foo in two separate stores they will retain their separate values var bb new bankersbox  bb set foo  bar bb get foo and and returns bar bb set count   bb incr count and and sets count to  returns  bb incr newcount and and sets newcount to  returns  bb lpush mylist  hello bb lrange mylist    and and returns hello bb rpush mylist  world bb lrange mylist    and and returns hello  world bb sadd myset  apple bb sadd myset  oragne bb smembers myset and and returns apple  orange bb sismember myset  apple and and returns true bb sismember myset  lemon and and returns false bb scard myset and and returns  keys must be strings in redis key value values must also be strings but with bankersbox you can also store numbers booleans arrays and objects when dealing with operations that involve numeric values incr decr etc the values should be numbers duh values stored in lists can also be strings numbers booleans arrays and objects values stored in sets should be strings when storing arrays or objects in sets the behavior is undefined exists append decrby incrby getset setnx strlen none see todo md lindex lpush lpushx lrange ltrim rpoplpush rpush rpushx scard sismember smembers smove srandmember none see todo md select by default bankersbox will use localstorage to persist data between sessions the main bankersbox js file comes with two adapters built in bankersboxlocalstorageadapter default adapter for using localstorage bankersboxnulladapter adapter which does not persist or restore data anywhere good for testing to specify your desired storage adapter pass it into the constructor in the options hash bb new bankersbox  adapter new bankersboxnulladapter to create your own adapter you must create an object which has the following three functions storeitem key value stores a value in the data store associated with a key param key a string param value a string returns void getitem key retrieves a value from the data store for the associated key param key a string returns string the value represented by key removeitem key deletes the value in the data store associated with the key param key a string returns void if you create your own adapters please add appropriate unit tests following the examples in the tests and adapter test coffee files bankersbox has tried to adhere as closely as possible to the redis command api and return values associated with each command in the cases where redis would normally return a nil value bankersbox will return the javascript null value in the cases where redis would return an error bankersbox will throw a bankersboxexception or bankersboxkeyexception depending on the situation simply copy bankersbox js or bankersbox min js if you have minified to your site s static assets folder and link to it inside your page bankersbox depends on using a global json object which must provide parse and stringify functions make sure to include a json library in the page as well or bankersbox will throw an exception when you try to instantiate to develop on bankersbox simply hack on bankersbox js to install the node modules needed for testing simply npm install bankersbox has a large suite of unit tests if you add new functionality please update or add the appropriate tests and bb test coffee file with new tests you can run the unit tests make test bankersbox is minified using the google closure javascript compression tool this is handled in the makefile with make min this will output bankersbox min js to test the minified version as well simply make testall mit license see

blacksmith site site settings site settings layouts layouts pages pages all page options all page options content content specifying metadata specifying metadata content snippets content snippets code highlighting code highlighting truncated content truncated content partials partials customizing partials customizing partials metadata references metadata references conditional metadata conditional metadata how does blacksmith render my site how does blacksmith render my site rendering procedure rendering procedure rendering data structure rendering data structure tests tests blacksmith sites have a specific directory structure for storing the various parts of your site settings layout partials pages and content content exists in two forms markdown files that blacksmith will render supporting content such as css and images all content will be rendered into and public to render a blacksmith site install blacksmith npm install blacksmith g render a site defaults to cwd blacksmith and path and to and your and site here s an example of a simple blog that blacksmith would render and site name settings for this blacksmith site blacksmith and content actual markdown content to render and posts a post md another post md and layouts layouts to use for pages you can specify multiple layouts but default html is the default default html and metadata metadata entities which can be reference in content metdata and authors author name json and partials html for partials inside of pages post html sidebar html metadata for rendering specific pages index json post json and public any additional files for viewing the site all rendered html will be placed here e g styles css favicon png each blacksmith site defines a hierarchical set of components which can be composed to create any type of site you want a couple of examples a documentation site a custom splash page or content site lets examine each of these components and where they are stored in your filesystem the settings for a given blacksmith site are stored in the blacksmith file located in the root directory of your site and and default layout specifying a name here will cause blacksmith to attempt to read and and and layouts and layout name json for rendering info if no layout name json file is found and and blacksmith will use and layouts and layout name html and and default default layout layout name  pages and and these settings will be used for all content in and and and content and posts post layout custom layout for posts  partials html id additional partials  another id for this page only  you can define settings for all components of your site in the blacksmith file or break them out into individual files within component directories for example the above example is equivalent to and blacksmith layout layout name and pages and post json layout custom layout for posts  partials html id additional partials  another id for this page only layouts are fully formed html files they are the top of the rendering hierarchy  all content will be inserted into a layout inside of the html element with the id content lets look at the worlds simplest layout title simple layout and title link rel stylesheet href css and styles css and head and div and body and html settings for a layout may be specified in your blacksmith file or in and layouts and layout name json lets look at an example and layouts and layout name json note these properties are not yet supported see roadmap roadmap for more details and and the template property specifies which html file within the and layouts directory and and to use when rendering this layout in this way a single html file can be reused with and and different partials and and if no template is specified then blacksmith will look for and layouts and layout name html and and when rendering template shared layout html  and and the partials property specifies which html partial or partials to insert at a given and and id within the layout these partials will be rendered with the metadata for a given and and individual page with content partials sidebar container sidebar  and and multiple partials can be concatentated into a single html id multi container partial  partial pages allows you to specify what type of content you wish to render and where to render it within a given layout as with layouts pages may be specified in your blacksmith file or in and pages and page name json lets look at two examples from our blog and pages and index json the above example demonstrates particular interest index json will always be used to render index html the following example specifies that blacksmith should render a list of post content which should be truncated and limited to a maximum of  posts note all lists are sorted descending by the date the content was created and and the content property specifies what blacksmith should render and and inside the html element with id content content list post  truncate true limit  and pages and post json the rendering information for an individual post is much simpler than our index json by creating this file blacksmith will  render all markdown files in and content and posts using the partial found at and partials and post html  render the partial found at and partials and sidebar html with the metadata for each markdown file in and content and posts and append it to the html element with id content partials content sidebar it is important to take note of the convention convention by default page content will be rendered in a partial of the same name alternatively we could have specified an explicit partial to use if no partial is specified and the default partial is not found then no metadata would be rendered in this case author name date of post etc a list of all available options that can be specified in a page json file are listed below and and specifies the layout for the page and and default layout for the site layout custom layout for page  and and specifies a mapping of html ids to partial s if content is specified and and then it is appended after the rendered markdown content partials html id partial name  another id multiple partials and and case  rendering content with a partial content custom partial and and case  consolidating multiple content sources in a list content list post  truncate true limit  in blacksmith  content is raw markdown and supporting files e g images located within the and content directory content for individual pages should be placed under and content and page name in our example all content for the post page should be placed under and content and posts it is important to take note of the convention convention page names are always singular but their content folder will always be plural the content for an individual page may also be a directory where supporting files such as images can be placed for example if we wanted to create a post with images the directory structure would be and site name and content and posts and post with supporting files content md an image png another image png some code js all metadata associated with content is stored within the individual markdown files as link definitions prefixed with meta because of a small limitation in the markdown format you must use the following syntax to specify metadata meta author author name meta title a really long title different from the filename meta nested values are also supported in large content pages it is often useful to have examples or references to other files to be inserted later in rendering a classic example is code samples in a blog post this is easy in blacksmith using content snippets consider the content and content and dir post index md whatever js markdown this is a piece of markdown content to be rendered later it has a reference to the file whatever js whatever js in this example whatever js in index md would be replaced with the contents of and content and dir post and whatever js note only files with text extensions js rb txt etc less than mb will be inserted because blacksmith uses marked we get the benefit of github flavored markdown through highlight js by default code highlighting is enabled all you need to do is add some css for your site for example border px solid eded border radius px margin px px px px padding px background color fefe overflow auto font size px font family consolas liberation mono  courier monospace white space pre color rgba   code keyword font weight bold color d code string code regexp color green code class code special color d code number color red code comment color grey it is necessary to truncate large content pages when rendering them within compilations i e lists this is supported by blacksmith with a special identifier in your markdown files for example and content and posts and dir post and index markdown markdown a simple post that is truncated with content snippets and metadata that is not used in the post truncate file js a second file reference with spaces file js meta author charlie index when rendered in a page like index json with truncate true only the content above truncate will be rendered partials are html fragments which are inserted into a layout a page or another partial all partials are rendered with plates page details author and and and and contents of and metdata and authors and author name json and and href and full and path and to and page  date fully qualified date page was published  files js filename file js  url and full and path and to and file js  img filename img png  url and full and path and to and img png all metadata is placed into partials using a set of simple plates conventions in the future it may be possible to customize these conventions but that is not currently planned map url like string keys to href keyname  map where href is key use key as href insert content into class content  map class content use content as value map string keys to class keyname  map class key use key map everything else to class keyname  map class key use key recursively map array keys  exports map metadata key   map recursively map object keys  exports map metadata key  map some content should only exist in partials when a given key is present in the metadata this is supported by blacksmith in the following way the keys in remove must be specified at the fully qualified path into an object  and partials and partial name json remove page details author github  twitter in the corresponding html file for the partial any elements with class if keyname will be removed if there is no value for keyname in the above example using the following template and partials and partial name html h about the author and h and div and div and div and this set of metadata page details author name charlie robbins  github indexzero  the output would be the following notice how everything inside if twitter has been removed h about the author and h and div and div it is useful when writing a content page to use a key to reference a larger section of metadata stored elsewhere these other sections of metadata are called metadata references and are loaded by blacksmith from and metadata for example and metdata and dogs and sparky mcpherson json name sparky mcpherson  breed labridoodle  color brown  age   temperment friendly and content and posts and a post md markdown rest of content meta dog sparky mcpherson when the content for this page finally gets rendered to a partial the metadata will not be dog sparky  it will be the entire object stored in and metadata and dogs and sparky json by convention convention for a given key value blacksmith will lookup metadata references for the value in the directory named with the plural of that key in the above example the key value pair is dog sparky mcpherson so we attempt to lookup sparky mcpherson within and metadata and dogs and sparky mcpherson json note authors is a special metadata reference which will always be within the metadata page details it s safe to skip this if you re not tinkering with blacksmith internals in order to render list pages with all options supported by blacksmith it is necessary to perform multiple rendering passes on a given site to fully render it lets examine that process start to finish  rendering starts rendering starts when blacksmith and full and path and to and your and site  function is invoked this tells blacksmith where the root directory for a given site is  load all html and rendering settings inside site prototype load will load all html and rendering settings stored in blacksmith and layouts and json and and html and pages and json and partials and html we need to load all of these files before any rendering can begin because they store the necessary settings for rendering  read everything under and content before layout page and partial rendering can take place all content i e markdown and supporting files must be known to blacksmith in our example how can we render the page represented by and pages and index json without all rendered content site prototype readcontent recursively reads and content building this data structure a post md another post md and dir post file js file js index markdown posts a post content html  markdown  metadata  another post content html  markdown  metadata dir post content html html rendered from markdown  markdown markdown in index markdown  metadata page details source and dir post and index markdown  title title of page in metadata and and href of page  date saturday november    href and dir post  files js filename file js  url and full and path and to and file js  img filename img png  url and full and path and to and img png    files file js  file js  render all pages as we discussed blacksmith uses hierarchical rendering components each component inherits the relevant properties from its parent entity the full hierarchy is layout partial page content partial notice that partials can be specified by both layouts and pages  in the event of a conflict the partials specified by the page will always be preferred lets examine a fully formed data structure for rendering each of our rendering data structures and and there are all inherited from site and layout that this and and page is associated with layout layout name html layouts  partials partials html id sidebar  another id breadcrumbs  multiple partials that can  be overridden and and metadata is extracted from link definitions on the page prefixed and and with meta key the key is what is stored in the metadata property and and e g meta author indexzero metadata author indexzero all tests are written with vows  and can be run with npm  npm test  rss feed  only render dirty files i e those not modified since last render  customize list sorting by key and direction  support nested partials  support rendering page depths greater than   support template and partials in layouts

763605, core text objective c wrapper  introduction  one of the most promising and mysterious new frameworks introduced in ios   is core text apple defines core text as a  text drawing engine  which allows mac and now ipad apps to render rich text on any graphics context strings drawn with core text feature lots of custom settings such as detailed font information columns variable line and paragraph heights and several different attributes which designers and font aficionados surely understand much better than i do many new apps have been using this framework since the release of the ipad particularly newspapers and ebook reader applications rendering gorgeous text in custom fonts many of them not available natively in ios this framework is also used in lifestyle and corporate applications too where using a custom font is sometimes required to match the specifications of brands and trademarks it is very important to understand that core text is really just a text drawing engine to be used on top of quartz core graphics  to render rich text on any graphics context core text cannot be used to create a rich text editor for example so don t expect to extend uitextview with it but you can use it to draw any kind of rich text on screen which can make you avoid using uiwebview instances for that one of the most interesting capabilities of core text is being able to render text in several columns however core text is a c based framework and i think that understanding and using the concepts and structures required to render text in columns can be particularly tricky to make the my life and that of my fellow developers easier this project contains a small set of objective c classes that encapsulate the creation of framesetters attributed strings and other constructions and takes care of the creation of several columns as well as the division of the text in several pages if required the api interface is very simple on purpose and i m pretty sure you ll be able to integrate it very easily in your own projects particularly if you look at the sample project where the classes are used i ve also added a category for uifont that returns the associated ctfontref pointer in a similar fashion to uiimage which is able to return a pointer to the underlying cgimageref pointer it also allows to create a ctfontref from any font embedded in the application bundle i am puzzled that the framework designers haven t included this by default in uikit what s next  a future extension i d like to add would be a couple of categories to parse simple rtf or html strings to start with probably just with bold and italic text and create the appropriate attributed string from it there s a couple of appkit extensions to nsattributedstring that do exactly that but for the moment they are only available in the mac version of cocoa and i haven t found anything similar for ios yet the following people have helped this project grow with pull requests comments or bug reports support for shadows in akocustomfontlabel akomulticolumntextviewdatasource protocol to add custom views in the text columns the code as usual is available through with bsd license see the license file  so feel free to use it and even contribute bug fixes or enhancements if you want the font embedded in the project is polsku regula available through the open font project requires xcode    and the ios sdk   and it creates a simple application that works on the ipad ios   as usual use it at your own risk enjoy

working directory this project is deprecated works with node   and works at the http request level it never drops requests or destroys keep alive sockets while reloading compatible with any http server easy to use cli interface for development with automatic reloading upon file changes gracefully handles reloads with syntax errors during development supports transpilers such as coffeescript make sure you structure your code so that your http server lives in a separate module that can be require d server js module exports http server function req res res writehead  res end hello world to get the up command make sure to install with the g flag npm install g up usage up options file the up command accepts the following options p and port the port to listen on not required if the module already listen s defaults to  w and watch whether to watch for changes watches the working directory for changes r and require mod specifies a module to require from each worker can be used multiple times tranpilers such as coffeescript can be supported with require and r coffee script n and number number of workers it gets evaluated with you can optionally use the cpus variable eg cpus and  you can use all the math methods eg round cpus and  defaults to number of cpus or  if nodeenv is development t and timeout number of ms after which a worker is killed once it becomes inactive strings like s are accepted defaults to m  or ms if nodeenv is development k and keepalive start a new worker after one dies unexpectedly f and pidfile a filename to write the pid to if specified restarts can be achieved with kill s sigusr cat pidfile txt t and title a value to give process title defaults to up the value will be appended with master or worker e g up master  up worker var up require up  master http server listen  and and initialize up var srv up master dirname and and server process on sigusr  function srv reload require up exports the upserver constructor which takes three parameters server http server server to accept connections on module string absolute path to the module options object numworkers number and string see workers above workertimeout number and string see timeout above title string see title above assumeready boolean see worker readiness below keepalive boolean see keepalive above minexpectedlifetime number and string number of ms a worker is expected to live don t auto respawn if a worker dies earlier strings like s are accepted defaults to s an upserver inherits from a distributor  which means you can use the main difference is that the default handler of up ie the last function in the middleware chain is the one that executes the round robin load balancing to reload the workers call srv reload in the example above and cli this is called by sending the sigusr signal if you re running with up cli this command is output to stderr for your convenience the cli tool also auto reloads if you pass the watch option and a file changes in the working directory  an up server starts with an arbitrary number of workers which defaults to the number of cpus  when a reload instruction is received it spawns an identical number of  upon the first of those workers binding to a port any subsequent requests are sent to that worker and all the workers containing old code are discarded  the discarded workers could have been processing requests so they only truly die after the configured workertimeout  which defaults to  minutes in production this means that if a user was uploading a file his request will be processed without interruptions  as other workers bind and become available they join the round robin by default up assume that new workers are ready for new connections immediately after they have been required this can be changed by setting assumeready to false  on the options object when initializing the up server through the javascript api the worker then needs to tell up when it s ready like this var up require up and and dummy async

1676524, newer versions of jqm will be integrated using angular jqm and not this project integration between jquery mobile and angular js needed as jquery mobile enhances the pages with new elements and styles and so does angular with this adapter all widgets in jquery mobile can be used directly in angular without further modifications furthermore this adapter also provides special utilities useful for mobile applications if you are interested in how to build mobile web apps with this adapter have a look at the german book angular    jquery   and jquery mobile    final issues can be reported at the github project if you have external jqm pages in your example note the directive ng app for the html element is required as in all angular applications include this adapter after angular and jquery mobile see below html ng app head title mobiletoys and title and head create a index xhtml file like the one below html ng app head title mobiletoys and title and head body your jqm pages and body and html and a main js file with the following content require config shim angular deps jquery  exports angular function tryholdready if tryholdready executed window jquery window jquery holdready true tryholdready executed true tryholdready require onresourceload tryholdready require jquery  jquery mobile angular adapter  and and your controllers angular modules  function jquery jquery holdready false this assumes that all libs are in the root folder of your webapp to put them into a subfolder like lib use the paths argument in the call to require config e g paths angular lib and angular  the libraries jquery jquery mobile and the adapter are already amd modules only angular is not which is why we need a shim config for it we simulate a later load event of the document by using jquery holdready  by which we wait until all modules have been loaded this is needed as the normal load event may occur before all modules have been loaded by requirejs note that this functionality was already included in requirejs  x but no more in requirejs  x usage of manual bootstrap of angular does not work well with jquery mobile as jquery mobile relies on the jquery ready event to be fired at the right time the adapter always takes the major and minor version of jquery mobile e g if you want to use jquery mobile   x use the adapter version   x the patch version is assigend incrementally directory structure compiled the created versions of the adapter jquery mobile angular adapter js the adapter jquery mobile angular adapter standalone js version of the adapter that includes jquery angular and jquery mobile if you want to do something during the initialization of jquery mobile use the following callback window mobileinit function src the main files of uitest js test and ui the ui self tests for uitest js test and unit the unit tests of uitest js install the dependencies npm install build it and nodemodules and bin and grunt auto run tests when file change and nodemodules and bin and grunt dev the adapter integrates angular routes with jquery mobile we set locationprovider htmlmode true  locationprovider hashprefix and add the tag base href address of your html file to your header by this we are compatible to the default jquery mobile url layout the base tag is created by jquery mobile for routes this makes all routes relative to the current page e g if your page is under and test and index html  and you want a route to and test and somepage html then your route would be routeprovider when and somepage html default routing if no route is defined the default jquery mobile url handling applies navigation to a hash shows the page whose id is the same as the hash e g navigation to a normal page loads that page using ajax and you can set the special property jqmoptions on routes e g routeprovider when and somepage  templateurl sometemplate html  jqmoptions transition flip  those properties are directly passed to mobile changepage for a documentation of the available options have a look at the jquery mobile documentation you can set the special property onactivate in routes if this is set it will be evaluated in the scope of the page to which the route navigates to before the pagebeforeshow event this expression can also use the properties from routeparams and route current locals  which are calculates by the resolve entry of the route e g routeprovider when and somepage and name  templateurl sometemplate html  onactivate somefn someparam name  resolve someparam function return hello  function somepagecontroller scope scope somefn function someparam name expect someparam tobe hello   relative links in pages are treated relative to the templateurl of the route not the route path e g given the mapping routeprovider when and somefolder and page html  templateurl page routeprovider when and somefolder and page html  templateurl and sometemplatefolder and page html page is embedded page and therefore all links within that page are relative to the initial url of the app page is an external page and all relative links in that page are relative to the folder and sometemplatefolder please also look at the extensions to the location service for controlling history and changing route params for just one route call default routing basepath and location url e g for a page and somepath and somepage html and location url and page this results in and somepath and page to be compatible to plain jquery mobile the adapter creates a default routing for all urls that are not mapped by other routes to and somepage however in plain jquery mobile this should load the page and somepath and somepage this is why we append the basepath to the location url using mobile changepage directly is not recommended it still works but it will no more update the browser location href if you don t want locationprovider htmlmode you can disable it by this you get hash urls like and index html and somepath back e g  module config function locationprovider locationprovider htmlmode false internally we use jquery mobile to load the pages and do the transition between the pages by this we automatically support the prefetching and caching functionality for pages from jquery mobile see their docs for details if you want to start an app directly on a subpage use the following url for an external page that should be loaded using ajax index html and somepage html for an internal page that is also contained in the index html index html and index html someotherpage yes this url contains  hashes if you are sure that all browsers that you use support the new history api you can also use the url index html someotherpage to start at an internal page restrictions controllers on routes are not supported please use ng controller within the page to be loaded for this or the onactivate function on routes the reasoning behind this is that some pages of jquery mobile are local pages in the same document as the main page and others are loaded using ajax however the pages in the same document are compiled at the same time the main page is compiled furthermore by supporting the page cache of jquery mobile assigning a controller would also not be possible to pass data via routes just let your controllers examine the current route using the route and routeparams service routes with a templateurl must point to a full jquery mobile page loading parts of jquery mobile pages is not supported the ngview directive cannot be used as jqm pages need to be inserted at a special place in the dom however the adapter takes care of the normal ngview handling and inserts the pages at the right place that html file that also includes angular and jqm all other pages can then be included using routes with a templateurl property every page of jquery mobile gets a separate scope the digest of the global scope only evaluates the currently active page so there is no performance interaction between pages for communicating between the pages use the ngm shared controller directive see below mobile pages are small so often a usecase is split up into multiple pages to share common behaviour and state between those pages this directive allows shared controllers the directive will create an own scope for every given controllers and store it in the variables as name  name  if the controller is used on more than one page the instance of the controller is shared note that the shared controller have the full scope functionality e g for dependecy injection or using watch ngm tap  taphold  ngm swipe  ngm swiperight  ngm swipeleft  ngm vmouseover  ngm vmouseout  ngm vmousedown  ngm vmousemove  ngm vmouseup  ngm vclick  ngm vmousecancel  ngm orientationchange  ngm scrollstart  ngm scrollend  ngm pagebeforeshow  ngm pagebeforehide  ngm pageshow  ngm pagehide the directive ngm if allows to add and remove an element to and from the dom depending on an expression this is especially useful at places where we cannot insert an ng switch into the dom e g jquery mobile does not allow elements between an ul and an li element methods and properties history go relativeindex this will directly call window history go relativeindex history goback calls history go  history urlstack this contains the list of visited urls history activeindex this defines the currently active index in the urlstack history removepastentries number this will remove the given number of history entries before the current entry the current entry stays current used when leaving dialogs or for location back note this does not fire any locationchange events location routeoverride someoverride by this you can override route properties only for the next routing this is useful e g for passing special parameters to the onactivate expression the following properties of routes can be overridden jqmoptions options to give to mobile changepage of jquery mobile e g transition  locals the resolved functions from the resolve hash in a route onactivate the expression to evaluate on the target page with the locals e g location routeoverride locals somekey somevalue  jqmoptions transition pop  location path and someroutepath function somepagecontroller scope scope someactivatefn function somekey expect somekey tobe somevalue   location backmode this will try to go back in history to the url specified by location e g if the navigation path to the current page is page page page and we then call location path page location backmode this will go two steps back in history note that this is in analogy to the already existing angular method location replace the service waitdialog allows the access to the jquery mobile wait dialog it provides the following functions show msg callback opens the wait dialog and shows the given message if existing if the user clicks on the wait dialog the given callback is called this can be called even if the dialog is currently showing it will the change the message and revert back to the last message when the hide function is called hide restores the dialog state before the show function was called waitfor promise msg shows the dialog as long as the given promise runs shows the given message if defined waitforwithcancel promise canceldata msg same as above but rejects the promise with the given canceldata when the user clicks on the wait dialog default messages are mobile loader prototype options textwithcancel for waitforwithcancel this is a new property mobile loader prototype options text for all other cases see the jquery mobile docs lists can be paged in the sense that more entries can be additionally loaded by loading we mean the display of a sublist of a list that is already fully loaded in javascript this is useful as the main performance problems result from dom operations which can be reduced with this paging mechanism to implement this paging mechanism the angular filter paged was created for displaying a page within a list simply use list and paged pagerid  this returns the subarray of the given array with the currently loaded pages parameters  the first parameter is required and must be unique for every usage of the paged filter it is the property name in the scope which stores the state of pagination for this filter usage and also contains the function loadmore and hasmore see below  if the second parameter is a number it is interpreted as the pagesize if this parameter is omitted the default page size is used this is by default  and can be configured using module ng value defaultlistpagesize   for filtering and sorting the paged array you can use filter chaining with the angular filters filter and orderby  e g list and filter name somename and orderby name and paged pagerid to show a button that loads the next page of the list use the following syntax pagerid is the id used in the paged filter pagerid hasmore returns a boolean indicating if all pages of the list have been loaded pagerid loadmore loads the next page into the list the following example shows an example for a paged list for the data in the variable mylist ul data role listview li ng repeat item in list and paged pager item and li li ngm if pager hasmore and li and ul note pagerid cache stores the last result that was returns for a list and paged pagerid expression this can be used to check whether the paged list is empty without refiltering the list the attribute data collapsed has bidirectional data binding e g using ng repeat with a checkbox or radio button without a wrapper element can be done like the following label ng repeat l in  l input type checkbox and label the jqm adapter does not change the url when a popup is opened and closed this is due to the fact that the jqm adatper assumes that urls represent routings for pages and not parts of pages the new attribute data opened has bidirectional data binding for opening and closing the popup e g the jqm adapter does not change the url when a panel is opened and closed this is due to the fact that the jqm adatper assumes that urls represent routings for pages and not parts of pages the new attribute data opened has bidirectional data binding for opening and closing the panel e g jquery mobile does not yet support refreshing a slider widget when child option elements have changed as a consequence using select data role slider with ng options only uses the initial state of the ng options collection chaning the ng options collection will not update the widget ng repeat is not supported on a select data role slider yet as jqm creates a sibling element to the select instead of a wrapper like in all other cases all integration work is done using the jqmngwidget provider this will automatically create angular directives for all jqm widgets that are contained in mobile and use the jqm widget factory e g mobile dialog if you want to specify a custom handler for a jqm directive use the following pattern ng config jqmngwidgetprovider  function jqmngwidgetprovider jqmngwidgetprovider widget someplugin  jqmngwidget  function jqmngwidget return link function widgetname scope ielement iattrs ngmodelctrl jqmngwidet createwidget widgetname ielement iattrs and and do additional binding work    see src and main and webapp and widgetadapters js for more examples jquery mobile has two kinds of markup stateless markup and widgets markup that does not hold state or event listeners and just adds css classes to the dom stateful markup and widgets markup that holds state e g event listeners this markup uses the jquery ui widget factory e g mobile button  which is created using button integration strategy  we have a precompile phase this is called before the angular compiles does it s work i e before compile is called and before directive template and directive templateurl is evaluated here we trigger the jqm create and pagecreate event before this we instrument all stateful jqm widgets see above  so they do not really create the jqm widget but only add the attribute jqm create widgetname and jqm link widgetname to the corresponding element by this all stateless markup can be used by angular for stamping e g in ng repeat  without calling a jqm method again so we are fast furthermore we have special handlers in the precompile phase for those jqm widgets that wrap themselves into new elements checkboxradio slider button selectmenu search input  as the angular compiler does not like this finally we also mark all jqm pages with the jqm page attribute this is needed as jqm pages are represented as data role page in the dom and angular does not allow to create directives that only match pages but not other jqm widgets  we have the directive ngmpage this creates an own scope for every page by this we are able to disconnect the scope of the pages that are not visible right now this is important for optimizing performance this creates the jqm pages by calling element page in the pre link phase however without the pagecreate event by this we only create the page instance but do not modify the dom as this is not allowed in the pre link phase furthermore the page jqm widget instance is already available for the other widgets which are created in the post link phase  we have the directive ngmcreate this will create the jqm widgets in the post link phase for widgets that wrap themselves into new elements this needs to be called for the wrapper that was already created in the precompile phase this is important as the jqm widgets do more dom transformations during creations that the angular compiler does not like e g the jqm widget input type checkbox enhances the sibling label element and wraps that element by calling the widget during the post link phase of the wrapper element those dom modifications are ok with angular  we have the directive ngmlink here we listen for changes in the model and refresh the jqm widgets when needed and vice versa for elements that wrap themselves into new elements this will be called on the original element e g the input for input type checkbox elements  in contrast to the ngmcreate directive  all together this minimizes the number dom traversals and dom changes we use angular s stamping for stateless widget markup i e we call the jqm functions only once and let angular do the rest we do not use the jqm create event for refreshing widgets but angular s directives by this we prevent unneeded executions of jquery selectors we reuse the selectors in jqm for detecting which elements should be enhanced with which jqm widgets ohter possibilities not chosen calling the jqm create event whenever the dom changes see the jqm docs however this is very slow as this would lead to many dom traversals by the different jqm listeners for the create event integration of jqm routing and angular routing we chose to use the angular routing as it is very flexible and programmable and it is easier to integrate jqm routing with angular routing and the other way around

1074826, ofxkinect  this repo will be left for anyone supporting old pre    and of projects and will not be updated the final master branch is compatible with of    copyright c   ofxkinect team mit license for information on usage and redistribution and for a disclaimer of all warranties see the file license txt in this distribution description  ofxkinect is an open frameworks addon for the xbox kinect that runs on mac osx linux and windows openframeworks is a cross platform open source toolkit for creative coding in c and and in the meantime we suggest you get the original xbox kinect model  and keep those new toys away from an xbox installation  git clone git and and github com and oftheo and ofxkinect git the addon should sit in openframeworks and addons and ofxkinect and if you are using a stable version   of openframeworks then you want to use a git tag of ofxkinect for that version you can select the tag in the github menu or clone and check it out using git for example the following commands will clone ofxkinect and switch to the of  tagged version git clone git and and github com and oftheo and ofxkinect git cd ofxkinect git checkout  the master branch of ofxkinect will work with the current master of openframeworks and can be considered unstable the develop branch is used for testing new features and bugfixes before they are applied to master git clone git and and github com and oftheo and ofxkinect git b develop warning the develop branch will be in flux so don t be surprised if things do not always work as expected if you re using windows codeblocks   and of and ofxkinect    you may see an issue where ofxkinect projects cannot compile and link due to missing the pthread library this is due to codeblocks removing some built in libraries between versions     the fix is to manually add the pthread win library which provides pthread  rename the lib file pre built  lib x libpthreadgc a to libpthread and copy it into the mingw folder for your codeblocks installation c program files x codeblocks mingw lib  if they do not exist copy the header h files in pre build  include into your codeblocks installation c program files x codeblocks mingw include running the example project  an example project is provided in the kinectexample folder as of of    ofxkinect no longer ships with the platform project files simply use the openframeworks projectgenerator in apps and projectgenerator to generate the xcode vs codeblocks projects and and or makefiles by pointing it to the kinectexample folder and making sure to include the following addons ofxkinect duh ofxopencv for blob tracking in the example not required by ofxkinect itself xcode open the xcode project select the kinectexample debug scheme and hit run install the libusb   library on ubuntu you can do this with sudo apt get install libusb    dev open the code blocks cbp and hit f to build optionally you can build the example with the makefile to run it use the terminal and exampledebug also you can add a set of udev rules which allow you to run a kinect app without root privileges sudo libs libfreenect platform linux udev  kinect rules and etc and udev and rules d precompiled libfreenect drivers and libusb win libs are included for windows make sure to install or update the libfreenect kinect camera motor and audio drivers through windows device manager by pointing it to the driver folder ofxkinect and libs and libfreenect and platform and windows and inf you may need to manually update each driver individually if you ve plugged it in before ofxkinect will not work if the drivers are not installed note you cannot use the openni drivers and the libfreenect drivers included with ofxkinect at the same time you must manually uninstall one and reinstall the other in the device manager sorry that s just how it is p how to create a new ofxkinect project  to develop your own project based on ofxkinect simply copy the example project and rename it you probably want to put it in your apps folder for example after copying openframeworks and addons and ofxkinect and kinectexample and openframeworks and apps and myapps and kinectexample and then after renaming openframeworks and apps and myapps and mykinectproject and rename the project in xcode do not rename the xcodeproj file in finder slow double click the project name and rename xcode close codeblocks and rename the cbp and workspace files to the same name as the project folder open the workspace and readd the renamed project file close visual studio and rename the sln file open the solution right click on the project in the project browser and select rename adding ofxkinect to an existing project  if you want to add ofxkinect to another project you need to make sure you include the src folder and the openframeworks and addons and ofxkinect and src as well as search paths for the addons ofxopencv and libs freenect libusb required by ofxkinect don t forget to include the ofxopencv addon sources and opencv libraries in the xcode project browser add the ofxkinect sources to the project create a new group ofxkinect drag these directories from ofxkinect into this new group ofxkinect and src ofxkinect and libs add a search path to the libusb headers and and and addons and ofxkinect and libs and libusb and include and libusb   to your project target build settings xcode add the lib path to your project xconfig see the example add the path to the libusb precompiled library and and and addons and ofxkinect and libs and libusb   and lib and osx and usb   a xcode add the lib path to your project xconfig see the example edit the makefile config files edit addons make in your project folder and add the following line to the end of the file edit config make in your project folder and change the lines for userlibs to userlibs lusb   add the ofxpd sources to the project right click on the addons folder in your project tree and create a new filter named ofxkinect drag the src directory from the ofxkinect addon folder in explorer into the ofxkinect folder in your project tree add header and library search paths right lick on your project and select

ofxkinect libs libusb win lib wincb libusb lib ofxkinect supports multiple kinects however stability is based on the bandwidth of your usb hardware if you only require the depth image it is recommended to disable the video grabbing of the rgb and ir images from your devices kinect init false false and and disable video image faster fps for kinectwindows microsoft states that only  kinects can be supported on the same usb bus in practice on osx this proves to be the case as even with the rgb images disabled there are transfer errors using ofxkinect and  kinects simultaneously if you need to support many kinects you will probably need to add extra usb controllers to your machine  developing ofxkinect

9971880, tracing js javascript function tracing tracing js is a library and utility to help you debug and trace javascript code have you ever had the need to know when a function is called check its parameters or the return value of course you have is part of regular development this is very easy to accomplish with your code you just write some debugging output into them or set up a breakpoint so the debugger will fire up when the code is called what about third party code or native functions you have the source code so is easy to go there and modify it or again set up a breakpoint but sometimes you don t feel like it or the code is minified and with native functions you don t have any of these options tracing js is here to help simply put tracing js will allow you to set functions of your own to be called before or after target functions get called it is like events for function invocations if you don t want to run specific code when this happens you can set up a regular trace for those functions and tracing js will print useful information when these functions get called things like the parameters used and the return values if any it even works for constructors and functions that have other objects attached to themselves like jquery s sets a function to be called right before the invocation of the function named by fnname the function fn will be called with the same context as the original function and will be passed the following parameters the name of the function you are tracing arguments an array of arguments passed to the function trace depth an integer representing the depth of traced calls this is not a stack depth per se unless you are actually tracing every function returns tracing js itself so calls can be chained examples javascript function myfunction console log inside function tracing before myfunction  function fnname arguments depth console log before calling myfunction before calling inside function tracing jquery javascript tracing before  function fnname args depth console log jquery will be called div jquery will be called document jquery will be called native functions be careful with these javascript tracing before array prototype push  function fnname args depth console log an array about to get bigger with and args  var myarray myarray push  an array about to get bigger with  myarray push  an array about to get bigger with  sets a function to be called just after the invocation of the function named by fnname the function fn will be called with the same context as the original function and will be passed the following parameters the name of the function you are tracing the return value of the function after being called trace depth an integer representing the depth of traced calls this is not a stack depth per se returns tracing js itself so calls can be chained examples javascript function myfunction console log inside function tracing after myfunction  function fnname retval depth console log after calling myfunction inside function after calling native functions javascript tracing after array prototype slice  function fnname retval depth console log sliced console log retval  slice        sets tracing on the given functions you can pass as many functions names as you want when the target functions get called information about them will be printed such as the arguments and the return value this is very useful when debugging specially recursive functions returns tracing js itself so calls can be chained javascript and and recursive version of common operators function add a b if b  return add and and a b return a function multiply a b accum accum accum and and  if b  return multiply a b add accum a return accum function square x return multiply x x tracing untrace trace square  multiply  add square  square called with arguments  multiply called with arguments   add called with arguments   add called with arguments   add called with arguments   add returned  add returned  add returned  multiply called with arguments    add called with arguments   add called with arguments   add called with arguments   add returned  add returned  add returned  multiply called with arguments    multiply returned  multiply returned  multiply returned  square returned  tracing untrace square  removes tracing from the given function names restoring the original code you can pass as many function names as you want or if you call it without arguments it will remove every trace currently set returns tracing js itself so calls can be chained javascript function myfunction tracing trace myfunction myfunction myfunction called with arguments myfunction returned undefined myfunction  myfunction called with arguments    myfunction returned undefined tracing untrace myfunction  that s it feel free to use the code however you see fit
12364261, barista is currently early in development it probably should not be used in an app you re shipping to end users just yet but it is likely more than adequate for internal tools or building development tools the api is not stable and could or will break for any reason usage and middleware  at its most basic a barista server is just an http server running on an arbitrary port it doesn t do anything by default in order to actually handle requests you need to add components to the server barista includes several components you might or might not want to add to your stack these include a url router cookies and sessions support for gzipping responses parsing request and response bodies only json is supported right now serving static files from a directory with automatic etag and if none match support objective c self addroute and foo and bar forhttpmethod get handler bool barconnection connection barrequest request nsdictionary parameters nsstring responsemessage nsstring stringwithformat hello  parameters bar and and parameters bar maps to the key and value set in the url e g  and foo and  barresponse response barresponse alloc init response statuscode  response body responsemessage datausingencoding nsutfstringencoding connection sendresponse response return yes middleware are inherently chainable if you add a barcookieparser and a barsessionstore before your barrouter  a request pipeline would look like this an incoming request comes in barcookieparser parses the cookies in the request if any and adds that data to the request barsessionstore examines the cookie objects attached to the request if any and adds the corresponding session to the request if it exists your routed method which now has access to both the cookies and the session handles the request and returns a response barsessionstore adds the cookie object to the response barcookieparser serializes the cookie object into a header and attaches it to the response the response is serialized out and returned to the client you ll notice that middleware can extend request and response objects with their own methods and data in the request of the above example barcookieparser converts headers into nshttpcookie objects and attaches those to the request barsessionstore looks for nshttpcookie objects and uses them to look up or create barsession objects which get attached to the request then your route has the ability to look for either the nshttpcookie objects or the barsession object and act accordingly similarly in the response the barsessionstore adds the cookies for the barsession to the response and the barcookieparser converts the cookies on the response to http headers middleware can also intercept requests and handle them automatically if appropriate preventing the actual route method from being called this is useful if for example you want to prevent users from accessing resources if they are not logged in if you implemented a piece of middleware that acted as an authorization gate and added it to the above middleware chain it would work something like this if the user is logged in an incoming request comes in barcookieparser parses the cookies in the request if any and adds that data to the request barsessionstore examines the cookie objects attached to the request if any and adds the corresponding session to the request if it exists your authorization gate would detect they are authorized and would continue perhaps adding user metadata to the session your routed method which now has access to both the cookies and the session handles the request and returns a response your authorization gate doesn t need to do anything to the response so it continues automatically barsessionstore adds the cookie object to the response barcookieparser serializes the cookie object into a header and attaches it to the response the response is serialized out and returned to the client if the user is not logged in an incoming request comes in barcookieparser parses the cookies in the request if any and adds that data to the request barsessionstore examines the cookie objects attached to the request if any and adds the corresponding session to the request if it exists your authorization gate would detect they are not authorized and would send a  forbidden or  unauthorized response your authorization gate doesn t need to do anything to the response so it continues automatically barsessionstore adds the cookie object to the response barcookieparser serializes the cookie object into a header and attaches it to the response the response is serialized out and returned to the client in the second outcome note that the routed method is never called this is because middleware has the ability to intercept requests send their own responses and prevent them from continuing to the next step in the chain this makes it very easy and flexible to isolate application logic from basic processing templating  in objective c objective c self addroute and hello forhttpmethod get handler bool barconnection connection barrequest request nsdictionary parameters barresponse response barresponse alloc init response

294069, after years of lack of a proper maintainer for one of why s jewels it has been decided to finally close the book on hpricot most users have migrated to alternatives and there is simply no time or energy to continue with the current codebase if you feel that you have the time and wish to take it over i suggest you instead think about making the hpricot like api within nokogiri  compatible that is a better use of your time but if you still feel like no damnit i wanna work on hpricot itself still then fork this repo and start work send evanphx or nicksieger a message if you feel like you want to take over the gem name with new releases under the hpricot name thanks to why for all the fun we ll never forget it hpricot is a fast flexible html parser written in c it s designed to be very accommodating like tanaka akira s htree and to have a very helpful library like some javascript libs jquery prototype give you the xpath and css parser in fact is based on john resig s jquery also hpricot can be handy for reading broken xml files since many of the same techniques can be used if a quote is missing hpricot tries to figure it out if tags overlap hpricot works on sorting them out you know that sort of please read this entire document before making assumptions about how this software works let s clear up what hpricot is hpricot is a standalone library it requires no other libraries just ruby while priding itself on speed hpricot works hard to sort out bad html and pays a small penalty in order to get that right so that s slightly more important to me than speed if you can see it in firefox then hpricot should parse it that s how it should be let me know the minute it s otherwise primarily hpricot is used for reading html and tries to sort out troubled html by having some idea of what good html is some people still like to use hpricot for xml reading but remember to use the hpricot xml method for that first here are all the links you need to know go there for news and recipes and patches it s the center of activity repository for hpricot you can get the latest code there see copying for the terms of this software spoiler it s absolutely free if you have any trouble don t hesitate to contact the author as always i m not going to say use at your own risk because i don t want this library to be risky if you trip on something i ll share the liability by repairing things as quickly as i can your responsibility is to report the inadequacies you may get the latest stable version from rubyforge win binaries java binaries for jruby  and source gems are available gem install hpricot we re going to run through a big pile of examples to get you jump started many of these examples are also found at want to add some of your own you have probably got the gem right to load hpricot require rubygems require hpricot if you ve installed the plain source distribution go ahead and just require hpricot the tt hpricot and tt method takes a string or any io object and loads the contents into a document object to load from a file just get the stream open doc open index html and f and hpricot f to load from a web url use tt open uri and tt  which comes with ruby require open uri hpricot uses an internal buffer to parse the file so the io will stream properly and large documents won t be loaded into memory all at once however the parsed document object will be present in memory in its entirety use tt doc search and tt doc search and and p class posted hpricot elements p  p tt doc search and tt can take an xpath or css expression in the above example attribute of tt posted and tt a shortcut is to use the divisor doc and p posted hpricot elements p  p if you re looking for a single element the tt at and tt method will return the first element matched by the expression in this case you ll get back the element itself rather than the tt hpricot elements and tt array doc at body onload the above code will find the body tag and give you back the tt onload and tt attribute this is the most common reason to use the element directly when reading and writing html attributes just as with browser scripting the tt innerhtml and tt property can be used to get the inner contents of an element doc and elementid innerhtml contents if your expression matches more than one element you ll get back the contents of all the matched elements so you may want to use tt first and tt to be sure you get back only one doc and elementid first innerhtml contents if you want the html for the whole element not just the contents  use tt tohtml and tt doc and elementid tohtml all searches return a set of tt hpricot elements and tt go ahead and loop through them like you would an array doc and p and a and img each do and img and puts img attributes class searches can be continued from a collection of elements in order to search deeper find all paragraphs elements doc search and html and body and and p continue the search by finding any images within those paragraphs elements and img hpricot elements img  img searches can also be continued by searching within container elements find all images within paragraphs doc search and html and body and and p each do and para and puts found a paragraph pp para imgs para search img if imgs any puts found imgs length images inside end of course the most succinct ways to do the above are using css or xpath the xpath version doc and and html and body and and p and and img the css version doc and html body p img or symbols work too doc and html and body and p and img you may certainly edit objects from within your search loops then when you spit out the html the altered elements will show doc and span entrypermalink each do and span and span attributes class newlinks puts doc this changes all tt span entrypermalink and tt elements to tt span newlinks and tt keep in mind that there are often more convenient ways of doing this such as the tt set and tt method doc and span entrypermalink set class newlinks every element can tell you its unique path either xpath or css to get to the element from the root tag the tt csspath and tt method doc at div div nth  csspath div div nth  doc at header csspath header or the tt xpath and tt method doc at div div nth  xpath and div and div eq  doc at header xpath and and div id header when loading html documents you have a few settings that can make hpricot more or less intense about how it gets involved really there are so many ways to clean up html and your intentions may be to keep the html as is so hpricot s default behavior is to keep things flexible making sure to open and close all the tags but ignore any validation problems as of hpricot   there s a new tt fixuptags and tt option which will attempt to shift the document s tags to meet xhtml   strict doc open index html and f and hpricot f fixuptags true this doesn t quite meet the xhtml   strict standard it just tries to follow the rules a bit better like say hpricot finds a paragraph in a link it s going to move the paragraph below the link or up and out of other elements where paragraphs don t belong if an unknown element is found it is ignored again tt fixuptags and tt so let s go beyond just trying to fix the hierarchy the tt xhtmlstrict and tt option really tries to force the document to be an xhtml   strict document even at the cost of removing elements that get in the way doc open index html and f and hpricot f xhtmlstrict true what measures does tt xhtmlstrict and tt take  shift elements into their proper containers just like fixuptags  remove unknown elements  remove unknown attributes  remove illegal content  alter the doctype to xhtml   strict the last option is the tt xml and tt option which makes some slight variations on the standard mode the main difference is that xml mode won t try to output tags which are friendlier for browsers for example if an opening and closing tt br and tt tag is found xml mode won t try to turn that into an empty element xml mode also doesn t downcase the tags and attributes for you so pay attention to case friends the primary way to use hpricot s xml mode is to call the hpricot xml method hpricot xml f also fixuptags is canceled out by the xml option this is because fixuptags makes assumptions based how html is structured specifically how tags are defined in the xhtml   dtd

10227416,  layersprites is a library designed to simplify the use of sprite sheets image maps containing multiple sub images in uikit applications without using opengl or rd party game libraries supported os sdk versions  supported build target ios   and mac os   xcode   apple llvm compiler   earliest supported deployment target ios   and mac os   earliest compatible deployment target ios   and mac os   note supported means that the library has been tested with this version compatible means that the library should work on this ios version i e it doesn t rely on any unavailable sdk features but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly arc compatibility  layersprites requires arc if you wish to use layersprites in a non arc project just add the fobjc arc compiler flag to all of the layersprites class files to do this go to the build phases tab in your target settings open the compile sources group double click each of the layersprites related m files in the list and type fobjc arc into the popover if you wish to convert your whole project to arc comment out the error line in each of the layersprites related m files then run the edit refactor convert to objective c arc tool in xcode and make sure all files that you wish to use arc for including all of the layersprites files are checked installation  to use layersprites just drag the class files into your project and add the quartzcore framework  the layersprites library currently includes the following classes lsimage this is a class for representing an image file with associated clipping and transform data it supports all the same image formats as uiimage and most of the same methods lsimagemap this is a class for loading image maps also known as image atlases or spritemaps lsimageview this is a uiview subclass designed to make it easier to display lsimage sprites in your app lsimage properties  the lsimage class has the following properties property nonatomic readonly cgsize size the size of the image in points as with uiimage on a retina display device the actual pixel dimensions may be twice the size depending on the scale property property nonatomic readonly cgfloat scale the image scale for x images on retina display devices this will have a value of   property nonatomic readonly cgrect contentsrect the clipping rectangle used to crop and resize the original image to fit the lsimage size this rect is measured in unit coordinates so for images that are not clipped the contentsrect size will be     property nonatomic readonly cgpoint anchorpoint the center point used to position the sprite measure in unit coordinates relative to the sprite bounds typically this will be      but if the sprite has been clipped then the value will be adjusted to compensate property nonatomic readonly cgaffinetransform transform a transform that should be applied to the image when it is displayed typically this will either be the identity transform or a  degree rotation used when the sprite has been rotated to fit inside an image map property nonatomic readonly cgimageref cgimage the underlying cgimage used by the lsimage you can use this to draw the image into a cgcontext or set the contents property of a calayer directly instead of using the setcontentswithlsimage category method lsimage methods  the lsimage class has the following methods and lsimage imagewithuiimage uiimage image contentsrect cgrect contentsrect anchorpoint cgpoint anchorpoint rotated bool rotated lsimage initwithuiimage uiimage image contentsrect cgrect contentsrect anchorpoint cgpoint anchorpoint rotated bool rotated  these methods create an lsimage with the specified contentsrect anchorpoint and an optional rotation by  degrees this is useful when manually creating sprites from an existing image note that the lsimage retains the original source image but does not duplicate it void drawatpoint cgpoint point this method draws the image at the specified point with the correct clipping and orientation applied unlike the equivalent uiimage this method will draw the sprite image centered on the point instead of descending down and leftwards from it the centering will depend on the anchorpoint and may not be the actual center of the image void drawinrect cgrect rect this method draws the image inside the specified rect with the correct clipping and orientation applied note that if the rect s aspect ratio does not match that of the size property the image will appear stretched the anchorpoint and size are ignored cgrect rectwhendrawnatpoint cgpoint point this method returns the bounding rect of the image when drawn at the specified point passing the result of this method to the drawinrect method is equivalent to calling drawatpoint with the same point calayer extension methods  lsimage extends calayer with the following method void setcontentswithlsimage lsimage image this method sets the layer contents image and associated attributes contentsrect contentsscale affinetransform needed to display the lsimage correctly this method does not set the anchorpoint or layer bounds void setdimensionswithlsimage lsimage image this method sets the bounds and anchorpoint for the sprite this is not neccesary if the sprite has not been trimmed but is required to display the sprite correctly if it has been trimmed from its original size lsimagemap methods  the lsimagemap class has the following methods and lsimagemap imagemapwithcontentsoffile nsstring nameorpath lsimagemap initwithcontentsoffile nsstring nameorpath these methods are used to create a lsimagemap from a file the parameter can be an absolute or relative file path relative paths are assumed to be inside the application bundle if the file extension is omitted it is assumed to be and xcode  atlasc file see using xcode  and spritekit texture atlasses below  or a plist currently the only image map file formats that are supported are the xcode  and spritekit texture atlas format and the cocosd sprite map format which can be exported by tools such as zwoptex or texturepacker lsimagemap fully supports rotated and trimmed images as well as image aliases it will automatically detect x retina imagemap files and files with the ipad suffix and lsimagemap imagemapwithuiimage uiimage image data nsdata data lsimagemap initwithuiimage uiimage image data nsdata data these methods are used to create a lsimagemap from data the data should represent the contents of an image map file in one of the formats supported by the imagemapwithcontentsoffile method if the image argument is nil lsimagemap will attempt to locate the image file from the filename specified in the data however if the image file is not located in the root of the application bundle it may not be able to find it in this case you can supply a uiimage to be used as the image map image and the image file specified in the data will be ignored nsinteger imagecount this method returns the number of images in the image map nsstring imagenameatindex nsinteger index this method returns the image name at the specified index image names are sorted alphabetically and do not necessarily reflect the order in which they appear in the sprite sheet file lsimage imageatindex nsinteger index lsimage objectatindexedsubscript nsinteger index these methods return the image map image at the specified index both methods behave the same way but the second is included to support object subscripting allowing the sprite to be accessed using the spritemap index syntax image map images are sorted alphabetically and do not neccesarily reflect the order in which they appear in the sprite sheet file if you wish to access the images in a specific order it is a good idea to name them numerically padded to the same length with zeros lsimage imagenamed nsstring name lsimage objectforkeyedsubscript nsstring name these methods return the image map image with the specified name both methods behave the same way but the second is included to support object subscripting allowing the sprite to be accessed using the spritemap spritename syntax depending on the tool used to generate the image map data file the name may include a file extension if you do not include a file extension in the name parameter png is assumed lsimageview methods  instancetype initwithimage lsimage image this creates a new lsimageview with the specified image the contentmode is set to uiviewcontentmodecenter the frame is set to the minimum size neccesary to display the entire image without clipping if clipstobounds were enabled  which may be larger than the size of the sprite itself if the sprite s anchorpoint is not in the center lsimageview properties  property nonatomic strong lsimage image this property can be used to set the image it will not resize the view fast enumeration  lsimagemap supports fast enumeration so you can easily iterate through the sprites in your map using the following syntax lsimagemap imagemap lsimagemap imagemapwithcontentsoffile foo plist for nsstring name in imagemap lsimagesprite sprite imagemap name and and do something with sprite displaying image sprites in your app  there are a number of ways to display sprite image loaded using layersprites the simplest approach is to use an lsimageview which behaves in a similar way to an ordinary uiimageview either create an instance of lsimageview using code or interface builder and set the image property using an lsimage e g and and create image view lsimageview view lsimageview alloc initwithframe cgrectmake     and and set the image view image image or you can create the lsimageview directly with an lsimage which will automatically set the size to fit the sprite and and create image view lsimageview view lsimageview alloc initwithimage image alternatively you can display an lsimage inside a calayer to do that use the following code and and create layer calayer layer callayer layer and and set sprite image and dimensions layer setcontentswithlsimage image layer setdimensionswithlsimage image and and set position and add to screen layer position cgpointmake  someview layer addsublayer layer check the layersdemo for an example of this in action if you are updating the image fror a sprite that has already been added to the screen you will probably want to disable implicit animations like this and and disable animation catransaction transaction catransaction setdisableactions yes and and set sprite image and dimensions layer setcontentswithlsimage image layer setdimensionswithlsimage image and and re enable animation catransaction commit the catransaction code is needed to disable implicit animations when setting the layer contents and other attributes it is possible to set many sprites within the same transaction which is why the transaction code is not included in the setter methods it is possible to disable implicit animations in other ways such as by specifying a custom actions dictionary you don t have to disable animations but the default animation effect of switching between sprites probably isn t what you d expect note  because the setcontentswithlsimage method sets the affinetransform of the layer you will need to re apply any transform and affinetransform to the layer after setting the sprite make sure to preserve the existing transform or the sprite may be oriented incorrectly you can do that like this and and create a new transform catransformd transform and and some transform and and set sprite transform without affecting sprite orientation layer transform catransformdconcat layer transform transform note  it does not seem to be possible to use the setdimensionswithlsimage method reliably with view backing layers if the sprite has been trimmed and rotated backing layers do not rotate correctly when the anchorpoint is not exactly     if you wish to place sprites inside views either use a nested sublayer or disable trimming and and or rotation when exporting the sprite sheet using image sprites with uikit and core graphics  although setting the sprite as a calayer s contents yields the best performance and memory usage you can also draw sprites directly into a cgcontext using drawatpoint or drawinrect methods see the drawingdemo for an example using xcode  and spritekit texture atlasses  layersprites can load sprites stored in the xcode  and spritekit texture atlas format to use a texture atlas first create a folder containing all of your sprite images both standard and x variants with the extension atlas and add it to your project then in your project build settings search for spritekit and set the enable texture atlas generation option this may appear as spritekittextureatlasoutput if you have not yet imported the atlas  with the default output texture atlas format of rgbapng there is no need to import the spritekit framework when importing your sprite sheet using the lsimagemap and imagemapwithcontentsoffile method either specify the file extension atlasc note the c  or leave off the path extension and lsimagemap will automatically find the atlas file if available you will need to use xcode  or above to generate the atlas files but they can be loaded and used by layersprites for apps running on ios   and above they are not limited to ios  check the textureatlasdemo for an example of using an xcode  texture atlas
8383053, the unio client is an easily extensible rest api client that supports any rest api that can be described in json the initiative behind unio is to describe rest apis in a simple readable json format this allows them to be imported into unio  and it will know automatically how to talk to the web service from the json spec you can simply import the spec and start making requests to the api right away this makes it easy for you to test use and reuse rest apis by saving you the time of writing an api client for every new service that pops up currently the apis implemented out of the box with unio are facebook twitter github instagram stackexchange npm install unio javascript var unio require unio var client unio and and with the facebook search api var params q coffee  accesstoken fb access token use fb get search  params function err response body console log first search result  body data  and and make an fql query var params q select firstname pic from user where uid   accesstoken fb access token use fb get fql  params function err res body console log results  body data and and use the twitter search api var params q banana  oauth consumerkey  consumersecret  token  tokensecret  use twitter get search and tweets  params function err response body console log search results  body and and use the twitter rest api to post a tweet var params status tweeting using unio  oauth consumerkey  consumersecret  token  tokensecret  use twitter post statuses and update  params function err res body and and and and with the instagram api var params id snow  accesstoken instagram access token use instagram get tags and id and media and recent  params function err res body and and and and import a json spec from the local filesystem spec and path and to and json and file use myspec post blah  function err res body and and and and add a new spec directly var apispec name api name  resources  path some and resource  methods post  params foo required  bar optional   and and other resource entries here and and now use the newly added spec spec apispec use api name post some and resource  foo   function err res body and and tells unio that the next request you make will be to the api whose spec has the name name if you don t call use before making a request it will default to the last api that you called use with adds a new rest api spec to the unio client spec can be an object representing an api specification an array of api specifications a string that is a path to a json file get an api resource  with optional params object for the request and an optional callback that looks like function err response body same usage as get  but sends a post request same usage as get  but sends a patch request same usage as get  but sends a put request same usage as get  but sends a delete request unio is intended to make it as easy and painless as possible to talk to http apis here s an example of what a spec looks like javascript name some api  resources  path users and id  methods get  put  params id required    path notes  methods post  params title required  text required  tags optional    name friends  path friends json  methods post  params id required   and and other resource entries here each unio spec must have a name this allows you to use the spec and start making requests the apiroot specifies the root url where the api resources are located array of api resources each object in the resources array represents a rest api resource for example a get user resource taking three optional parameters id name and location would look like this javascript path user  methods get  params id optional  name optional  location optional each of the resource keys are described below optional name of the resource when you make a request with unio for example with get resource  you can specify the resource by its name value rather than by its path think of it like an alias path value for the resource e g if the following resource is specified javascript name statuses and update  path statuses and update json  methods post  params foo required you can then request the resource by specifying its name or its path javascript and and get a resource by specifying its name use get statuses and update  params callback and and get a resource by specifying its path use get statuses and update json  params callback http verbs that may be used to request the resource allowed get  post  put  delete  patch object representing the parameters accepted by the resource each parameter must be marked optional or required

3204070, the fitstar fork has tons of updates that break backwards compatibility so we are leaving this repo live for reference of the older interfaces it will no longer be maintained here though so you should upgrade to the fitstar fork falcore is a framework for constructing high performance modular http servers in golang modular and flexible design hot restart hooks for zero downtime deploys builtin statistics framework builtin logging framework falcore is a filter pipeline based http server library you can build arbitrarily complicated http services by chaining just a few simple components requestfilters are the core component a request filter takes a request and returns a response or nil request filters can modify the request as it passes through responsefilters can modify a response on its way out the door an example response filter compressionfilter  is included it applies deflate or gzip compression to the response if the request supplies the proper headers pipelines form one of the two logic components a pipeline contains a list of requestfilters and a list of responsefilters a request is processed through the request filters in order until one returns a response it then passes the response through each of the response filters in order a pipeline is a valid requestfilter routers allow you to conditionally follow different pipelines a router chooses from a set of pipelines a few basic routers are included including routing by hostname or requested path you can implement your own router by implementing falcore router routers are not requestfilters  but they can be put into pipelines falcore is currently targeted at go   if you re still using go r  x you can get the last working version of falcore for r  using the tag lastr check out the project into goroot and src and pkg and github com and ngmoco and falcore build using the go build command see the examples directory for usage examples to use falcore to serve https simply call listenandservetls instead of listenandserve if you want to host ssl and nonssl out of the same process simply create two instances of falcore server you can give them the same pipeline or share pipeline components

3924478, this project is deprecated for your future pointer event needs please use this pointerevents polyfill new polyfill  part of the polymer project polymer for background and motivation see this blog post this is a library that enables mspointer style pointer events in all browsers the whole point of pointer js is to use pointer events instead of mouse and touch you can do this by subscribing to these events in the same way as you would regular events var el document queryselector myselector el addeventlistener pointerdown  function e and and approach override addeventlistener to intercept pointer events theoretical alternative have an explicit el emitpointers call as soon as you start listening for pointer events both mouse and touch events are hijacked and do not fire the event payload for a pointer event includes the following important features string pointertype the kind of pointer it is touch mouse pen object originalevent the original event payload from the underlying event function getpointerlist gets the list of active pointers ie mouse pressed fingers on the screen the bottom line is that you code your input to a single spec pointer events from pointer js the library abstracts all of the input differences for you under the consolidated model events pointerdown pointermove pointerup event payload class originalevent pointertype getpointerlist pointer class clientx clienty screenx screeny pagex pagey tiltx tilty pressure hwtimestamp pointertype identifier now that we have a solid touch and mouse and stylus abstraction we can build higher level gestures on top some interesting events to support are tap double tap longpress swipe pinch zoom and rotate emit new gesture events for example gesturedoubletap  gesturelongpress  gesturescale  etc this is incompatible with safari s gesturestart events but in the future can also be consolidated under one umbrella this is done with the same addeventlistener hack as is used for pointer events each of these gesture events has a recognizer associated with it if for example gesturescale is specified the pointer event based recognizer gets pulled into the event loop each gesture has a custom event associated with it this function takes an htmlelement as its only argument the following gestures are supported gesture gesture event  double tap gesturedoubletap long press gesturelongpress scale gesturescale this is a nice place to contribute if you re so inclined gesture recognizers can easily be plugged into this architecture they are completely standalone and can be registered easily for an example take a look at the doubletap handler doubletap the scale gesture implements a pinch zoom and provides the scaling factor as part of the event payload through evt scale will the way addeventlistener is overridden cause problems in the future is the overhead of firing a custom event vs calling a function too high see this test on jsperf com jsperf does the gesture approach make sense on ios which provides built in gesture support how to consolidate

3923123, weasel diesel is a dsl to describe and document your web api the wdsinatra gem allows you to generate the structure for a sinatra app using weasel diesel and with lots of goodies updating is trivial since the core features are provided by this library and the wdsinatra gem you can also check out this sinatra based example you can fork and use as a base for your application dsl examples describeservice and helloworld do and service and service formats json service httpverb get default verb can be ommitted service disableauth on by default input service param string name default world  doc the name of the person to greet output service response do and response and response object do and obj and obj string message doc the greeting message sent back defaults to world obj datetime at doc the timestamp of when the message was dispatched documentation service documentation do and doc and doc overall this service provides a simple hello world implementation example action and implementation specific to the sinatra app example can instead be set to call a controller action service implementation do message hello params name  at time now tojson or a more complex example using xml specoptions rspec  bacon usually pulled from a model describeservice and wsdsl and test xml do and service and service formats xml json service httpverb get input service params do and p and

overall markdown description text doc overall doc this is a test service used to test the framework doc doc example markdown text doc example doc the most common way to use this service looks like that doc end as shown in the two examples above input parameters can be optional or required namespaced marked as not being null if passed set to have a value defined in a list set to have a min value set to have a min length set to have a max value set to have a max length documented most of these settings are used to verify the input requests integer float decimal boolean array comma delimited string binary file you can t set a required param to be null true  if you do so the setting will be ignored since all required params have to be present if you set an optional param to be null false  the verification will only fail if the param was present in the request but the passed value is nil you might want to use that setting if you have an optional param that by definition isn t required but if passed has to not be you can set many rules to define an input parameter here is a quick overview of the available param options check the specs for more examples options can be combined required by default the defined optional input parameters are optional however their presence can be required by using this flag setting null true will be ignored if the paramter is required example service param string id required true in or options limits the range of the possible values being passed example service param string skills options w ruby scala clojure default sets a value for your in case you don t pass one example service param datetime timestamp default time now iso minvalue forces the param value to be equal or greater than the option s value example service param integer age minvalue  maxvalue forces the param value to be equal or less than the options s value example service param integer votes maxvalue  minlength forces the length of the param value to be equal or greater than the option s value example service param string name minlength  maxlength forces the length of the param value to be equal or lesser than the options s value example service param string name maxlength  null in the case of an optional parameter if the parameter is being passed the value can t be nil or empty doc document the param input parameters can be defined nested and namespaced this is particuliarly frequent when using rails for instance service params do and param and param string framework in rspec  bacon  required true doc the test framework used could be one of the two following weaseldieselspecoptions join  param datetime timestamp default time now param string alpha in a  b  c param string version null false doc the version of the framework to use param integer

boolean mailinglist default true doc is the user subscribed to the ml user array skills in w ruby js cooking service params namespace attachment null true do and attachment and attachment string url required true here is the same type of input but this time using a json jargon namespace and object are aliases and can therefore can be used based on how the input type service params do and param

1880002, language js  language js is an experimental new parser based on peg parsing expression grammar  with the special addition of the naughty or operator to handle errors in a unique new way it makes use of memoization to achieve linear time parsing speed and support for automatic cut placement is coming to maintain mostly constant space as well for a discussion of cut operators see www ialab cs tsukuba ac jp and mizusima and publications and paste mizushima pdf the most unique addition language js makes to peg is how it handles errors no parse ever fails in language js instead syntaxerrornodes are placed into the resultant tree this makes it trivial to do things like write syntax highlighters that have live error reporting this also means that language js is very competent at handling multiple errors as opposed to aborting on the first one that is reached a new operator designed specifically to handle errors trivially and declaritively is added on top of the normal peg operators the naughty or operator behaves just like the choice operator and  but only gets used if the parse first completely fails because of this performance is guaranteed to never be affected  regardless of how many error rules you add to the grammar thus you are allowed to offer alternative incorrect but valid grammars to provide increasingly useful errors to your users more importantly users can easily submit patches to deal with the problems they encounter for example the following simplified snippet from the javascript grammar identifier reservedword identifierpart identifiername reservedwordidentifier reservedwordidentifier identifier can t be a reserved word reservedword identifierpart generates the following error message with no additional code for new  new  error line  identifier can t be a reserved word
591795, discontinued  we are very sorry to announce that development of this plugin has been discontinued google has created their own android development toolchain based on gradle which supercedes this plugin this is the android plugin for the gradle build system this plugin enables the creation of android applications using gradle with all of the power and flexibility you ve come to expect from gradle currently gradle   rc  is required for mailing lists see the project page on google code for issue tracking see the github issues page features of the android plugin include compile package and install android applications including handling of android resource files sign application packages using the default debug key or with a release key for publication to android market incorporation of proguard to ensure that applications have minimal memory footprint easily create android applications in scala and possibly groovy or clojure the android plugin fully integrates into the gradle build lifecycle by extending the java plugin furthermore the incorporation of proguard into the build not only ensures that android application packages are small and tight it also trivially enables the use of scala for android application development simply by incorporating the existing scala plugin into the build proguard will include only those classes from the scala library that are actually used by your android application resulting in an application package that is as small as possible tasks and lifecycle  the android plugin adds the following tasks and dependencies to the androidprocessresources generate r java source file from android resource xml files compilejava task depends on this task proguard process classes and jars with proguard by default this task is disabled more on this below jar androidpackage creates the android application apk package proguard androidsignandalign signs with a debug or provided key more on this below and zipaligns the application apk package androidpackage assemble lifecycle task depends on this task androidinstall installs the built package onto a running emulator or device assemble androiduninstall uninstalls the application from a running emulator or device androidemulatorstart starts the android emulator androidinstrumentationtests runs an instrumentation test suite on a running emulator or device androidinstall to use the android plugin for gradle you must first create the application skeleton using the android command line tool for example android create project target  path and myandroidapp activity myandroidactivity package my android package this will create and android application skeleton that you can immediately build using ant to build with gradle instead you must  create a build gradle file that includes the android plugin and  either move the source code to the directory expected by gradle or tell gradle to use the src directory of your project directly  create a build gradle file in the root directory of the project and include the android plugin as follows buildscript repositories mavencentral dependencies classpath org gradle api plugins gradle android plugin    apply plugin android repositories mavencentral  the android create project command created the source code directly in the src directory of the project the android plugin tries to conform to the conventions established by android s ant based build but in this case it is better to conform to gradle s source sets convention since it allows you to have separate test source code or to use multiple languages therefore we recommend that the source should be moved to src and main and java instead once you ve done this you can of course utilize gradle s source sets to their full extent by placing resources in src and main and resources scala source files in src and main and scala etc however if you prefer to keep your source code directly in the src directory for example if you need to retain compatibility with ant then you can do so by configuring the java source set in your build gradle file just add the following to build gradle sourcesets main java srcdir src and java  if your android project was initially created by eclipse rather than the android create project command then you will have some additional setup work to do the android plugin for gradle must be told the location of the android sdk when you create a project with the android create project command the location is filled in for you by the application generator but the eclipse project generator does not provide this information to the project therefore you must fill it in yourself to do this create or edit the local properties file in the root of the project and add the sdk dir property referring to the location of your android sdk installation sdk dir and path and to and android and sdk note that this file should not be checked in to your version control system as it will likely differ across various development environments alternatively you can use the androidhome environment variable instead once you ve performed these steps you can build your android application by invoking the tasks described above a complete minimal but real world example is as follows build gradle  buildscript repositories mavencentral and and to use a development snapshot version of the plugin add the and and sonatype snapshots repository maven  dependencies classpath org gradle api plugins gradle android plugin    apply plugin android repositories mavencentral and and sets the package version version    and and signing configuration valid for all builds  androidsignandalign keystore path and to and my and keystore keyalias my key alias keystorepassword mystorepass keyaliaspassword myaliaspass and and configure the filtering of resources with properties from the gradle s project scope  processresources expand project properties and and configure a dedicated debug build  task configuredebug jar classifier debug and and configure a dedicated release build  task configurerelease proguard enabled true  this build script configures the build to sign with a provided keystore this configuration applies for every build  it also sets gradle to expand properties in every resource file  in this way you can get a full build with the command gradle assemble it processes all the resources expanding them with properties from the project s scope compiles classes packs them into the dex file builds the apk signs it with the provided keystore but does not process it with proguard and zipaligns you can see the proguard task is skipped from gradle s output during the build you can create several build configurations and choose which one to execute from the gradle command line the task configuredebug  defines the gradle classifier for the package name executing this build with the command gradle configuredebug assemble creates a package with same steps than the default build but the package name is project x y z debug apk the task configurerelease  defines a release configuration task which in the same output directory to disable signing and get a signed apk with the debug key you can remove the androidpackage configuration  if keystore or keyalias are null the signing is skipped and the debug key is used of course you can put the signing configuration in a dedicated configuration task and invoke that task in order to get a signed package or not to call it for the debug signed package also note that if you don t supply password that is keystorepassword or keyaliaspassword are null  gradle asks for them on the command line not very good for ci servers to install the generated apk onto a running emulator or a device connected with usb and configured in debug mode  run gradle androidinstall this installs the default built package as with previous examples if you want to install the debug or release package you have to issue gradle configuredebug androidinstall gradle configurerelease androidinstall the androiduninstall task unistalls the application from a running emulator or a device there is no need to specify which package there can be only one package to undeploy and it s defined by the base package name of the application from androidmanifest xml you can use gradle to generate an eclipse project for you the android plugin enhances this process by setting up the eclipse project correctly for android which includes establishing the correct class path and inserting the android builders into the build process to use the eclipse integration first make sure that you apply the gradle eclipse plugin in your build gradle file apply plugin eclipse then you can generate the eclipse project files as follows gradle eclipse instrumentation tests  the plugin is able to run instrumentation tests for you on a connected device or emulator gradle androidinstrumentationtests on projects that do not define any instrumentations in their manifest this task will safely be skipped by default the task runs all tests in the given project using android s default test runner if you want more control you can add a configure closure to your test project androidinstrumentationtests runners run with com mydomain mytestrunner  options the run method can you be used in different ways if used as above all tests will be run using the given test runner the options field can be used to route parameters to the activity manager that s used to run the instrumentation cf adb shell am instrument note that you don t have to supply the w parameter that s done by default you can also partition your test suite to run with different runners note that this only works if you don t also have a more general runner configured as seen above currently the plugin allows you to partition by test package and annotation run testpackage unit  with myunittestrunner run annotation android test suitebuilder annotation smoke  with mysmoketestrunner if your test project s package id is com myapp test then this configuration will first run all test cases within the com myapp test unit package with the com myapp test myunittestrunner and then run all test cases carrying android s smoke annotation in the same manner there is also limited support for publishing junit compliant test reports that can be read by build servers like hudson currently this only works if you re using the android junit in that case the test reports generated by that runner will be published to build and test results we plan to make this more flexible and configurable in future versions start emulator  for starting the emulator wih gradle you need do define the avd name from your android emulator in your build gradle androidemulatorstart avdname main limitations  in the current version of the android plugin the proguard task is not very configurable the androidmanifest xml file is not processed as a normal resource i e there is no properties expansion so for example you don t get the version set in the version tag you have to align them manually

4445125, a websocket competition will your favorite platform come out on top if you think your platform of choice was poorly represented submit a pull request just create the hello world of socket servers an echo server that speaks websocket version   is the only version my client supports first write your implementation in place it in the competition and directory added any instructions needed to install dependencies in configureubuntu   sh add any build instructions to competition and makefile if your project needs to be compiled and stop the servers while running the tests in order to include your server in the test you need to create a supervisord ini file in competition and servers program servername s command command s autostart false autorestart false startretries  stopasgroup true killasgroup true the server name must follow the following format language platform for instance if you wrote an echo server using bash and nc the server name would be bash nc you can add additional demarcations if needed for instance the python tornado example has a single threaded version and a multiprocessor version which go by the name python tornado  and python tornado n next you need to add your server to the server list in wsdemobench app src configuration file finally add yourself to the authors file you ve earned it it is best to run the benchmark client on a separate machine than the servers using two brand new ubuntu   servers run the configureubuntu   sh script on each this script will destructively alter each server so use caution and review the script before running if you want to use a different os use configureubuntu   sh as a template for configuring your system of choice next compile the code on both machines make to run a single benchmark on a server do the following and runtest dbpath duration hostname port clientcount for instance for a benchmark of      of  clients lasting  seconds with with the data stored at data and myserver the command would and runtest data and myserver        there are two components in wsdemobench the first component is supervisord wsdemobench communicates with supervisord to start and stop each server before each benchmark on the machine that you are running the servers on do the following sudo bash ulimit n  cd competition supervisord you can monitor supervisord by using the supervisorctl command competition and supervisorctl status next on the client machine create a config and small scale config file sasl saslerrorlogger file logfile  wsdemobench host ip  port   dbroot dbroot  clients   seconds   supervisord serverhost  replace logfile  ip  dbroot and serverhost with the correct values ensure that both the path to logfile and the path to dbroot exist or the test will crash this configuration file describe a test using  clients for  seconds each test we will use this smaller test to ensure that all the servers start and stop properly to run this benchmark do the following sudo bash ulimit n  and bin and runalltests sh config config and small scale config if all goes well you should see the suite running in front of your eyes let that run for the entire test it should run for  minutes if any of the servers crashes you can do the following to diagnose the cause competition and supervisorctl tail servername stderr after the small scale test it is time to run the full scale test sasl saslerrorlogger file logfile  wsdemobench host ip  port   dbroot dbroot  supervisord serverhost  here is the full spec for the wsdemobench config host host string  port port integer  dbroot dbroot directory  supervisord host   clients number  defaults to  seconds number  defaults to  servers servername string   servernamen string defaults to full suite  the resulting leveldb databases will be placed in your configured dbroot the events are stored as binary erlang terms in the database so you will need to export the events to use them there are two scripts to do that and bin and compileallstats sh and and bin and convertallstats sh and bin and compileallstats sh creates three csv tables counts csv the sums of all the events handshaketimes csv timestamp elapsed usecs for each handshake messagelatencies csv timestamp elapsed usecs for each message and bin and convertallstats sh dumps the raw events as a events csv table the events data has the following fields timestamp type clientid eventkey eventdata timestamp the timestamp of the event type the server type clientid a string that identifies the client eventkey the event type eventdata event specific data the eventdata is used to pair wsinit and wsonopen events to calculate the elapsed handshake time and the eventdata is used to pair sendmessage events to recvmessage events to calculate the elapsed message time the eventdata for exit events take the format of pid  reason any these are some of the expected reasons for a client crash connectiontimeout the client could not establish a connection with the server in under  seconds normal the server closed the connection this should never happen for this benchmark any reason other than these are an unexpected error and should be if you see a error reason you should probably file a bug report as well unless you can determine it is a server issue

2925873, precog is an advanced analytics engine for nosql data it s sort of like a traditional analytics database but instead of working with normalized tabular data it works with denormalized data that may not have a uniform schema you can plop large amounts of json into precog and start doing analytics without any preprocessing such as time series analytics filtering rollups statistics and even some kinds of machine learning there s an api for developer integration and a high level application called labcoat for doing ad hoc and exploratory analytics precog has been used by developers to build reporting features into applications since precog has very comprehensive developer friendly apis  and together with labcoat  precog has been used by data scientists to perform ad hoc analysis of semi structured data this is the community edition of precog for more information about commercial support and maintenance options check out slamdata source project a few landmarks common data

projects the tests in the muspelheim project would be run from the surtr project not from muspelheim  but using the test data stored in muspelheim all of the other projects are significantly saner at this point ideally you would be able to run and build test sh and everything would be fine unfortunately at the present time you have to jump through a few hoops in order to get all of the dependencies in order this should be relatively painless grab the repository and run sbt publish local after everything finishes you should be able to just move on to the next ball of wax kafka unfortunately kafka has yet to publish any public maven artifacts much less artifacts for precisely the version on which precog is dependent at the current time the best way to deal with this problem is to simply grab the and extract this file into your and ivy and cache and directory once this is done you should be ready to go altogether you need to run the following commands git clone git github com jdegoes and blueeyes git cd blueeyes sbt publish local cd cd and tmp tar xf kafka stuff tar gz c and ivy and cache and cd cd platform sbt from here you must run the following tasks in order test compile ratatoskr and assembly extract data the last one should take a fair amount of time but when it completes and everything is green  you can have a pretty solid assurance that you re up and running in order to more easily navigate the codebase it is highly recommended supports it our filename conventions are inconsistent these instructions are at best rudimentary but should be sufficient to get started in a minimal way more will be coming soon the precog environment is organized in a modular service oriented fashion with loosely coupled components that are relatively tolerant to the failure of any single component with likely degraded function most of the components allow for redundant instances of the relevant service although in some cases bifrost in particular some tricky

precog contributor license agreement cla md we use a pull request model for development when you want to work on a new feature or bug create a new branch based off of master do not base off of another branch unless you absolutely need the work in progress on that branch collaboration is highly encouraged accidental branch dependencies are not your branch name should be given one of the following prefixes topic and for features changes refactorings etc e g topic and parse function bug and for things that are broken investigations etc e g bug and double allocation wip and for code that is not ready for team wide sharing e g wip and touch me and die if you see a topic and or bug and branch on someone else s repository that has changes you need it is safe to base off of that branch instead of master  though you should still base off of master if at all possible do not ever base off of a wip and branch this is because the commits in a wip and branch may be rewritten rearranged or discarded entirely and thus the history is not stable do your work on your local branch committing as frequently as you like squashing and rebasing off of updated master or any other topic and or bug and branch at your discretion when you are confident in your changes and ready for them to land push your topic and or bug and branch to your own fork of platform you once you have pushed to your fork submit a pull request using github s interface take a moment to describe your changes as a whole particularly highlighting any api or quirrel language changes which land as part of the changeset once your pull request is ready to be merged it will be brought into the staging branch which is a branch on the mainline repository that exists purely for the purposes of aggregating pull requests it should not be considered a developer branch but is used to run the full build as a final sanity check before the changes are pushed as a fast forward to master once the build has completed successfully this process ensures a minimum of friction between concurrent tasks while simultaneously making it extremely difficult to break the build in master build problems are generally caught and resolved in pull requests and in very rare cases in staging this process also provides a very natural and fluid avenue for code review and discussion ensuring that the entire team is involved and aware of everything that is happening code review is everyone s responsibility there is one hard and fast rule if the commits have been pushed do not rebase once you push a set of commits either to the mainline repository or your own fork you cannot rebase those commits any more the only exception to this rule is if you have pushed a wip and branch in which case you are allowed to rebase and and or delete the branch as the reason for this policy is to encourage collaboration and avoid merge conflicts rewriting history is a lovely git trick but it is extremely disruptive to others if you rewrite history out from under their feet thus you should only ever rebase commits which are local to your machine once a commit has been pushed on a non wip and branch you no longer control that commit and you cannot rewrite it with that said rebasing locally is highly encouraged assuming you re fluent enough with git to know how to use the tool as a rule of thumb always rebase against the branch that you initial cut your local branch from whenever you are ready to push thus my workflow looks something like the following git checkout b topic and doin stuff hack commit hack commit hack commit hack git fetch upstream git branch f master upstream and master git rebase i master squash checkpoint commits etc git push origin topic and doin stuff if i had based off a branch other than master  such as a topic and branch on another fork then obviously the branch names would be different the basic workflow remains the same though once i get beyond the last command though everything changes i can no longer rebase the topic and doin stuff branch instead if i need to bring in changes from another branch or even just resolve conflicts with master  i need to use git merge this is because someone else may have decided to start a project based on topic and doin stuff  and i cannot just rewrite commits which they are now depending on to summarize rebase privately merge publicly precog was originally designed to be offered exclusively via the cloud in a multi tenant offering as such it has made certain tradeoffs that make it much harder for individuals and casual users to install and maintain in the current roadmap phase  involves simplifying precog to the point where there are so few moving pieces anyone can install and launch precog and keep precog running without anything more than an occasional restart milestone and divided into the following tickets many of these tickets indirectly contribute to phase  by bringing the foundations of precog closer into alignment with hdfs currently precog can only handle the amount of data that can reside on a single machine while there are many optimizations that still need to be made such as support for indexes type specific columnar compression etc  a bigger win with more immediate impact will be making precog big data ready  where it can compete head to head with hive pig and other analytics options for hadoop spark is an in memory computational framework that runs as a yarn application inside a hadoop cluster it can read from and write to the hadoop file system hdfs  and exposes a wide range of primitives for performing data processing several high performance scalable query systems have been built on spark such as shark and blinkdb given that spark s emphasis is on fast in memory computation that it s written in scala and that it has already been used to implement several query languages it seems an ideal target for precog the work is currently divided into the following tickets introduce a group by operator into the intermediate algebra refactor solve with simpler saner semantics create a table representation based on spark s rdd implement table ops in terms of spark operations support for dynamically typed multi dimensional sql sql for heterogeneous json  and possibly other query interfaces such as jsoniq and unql this program is free software you can

3247154, backbone query  a lightweight kb minified utility for backbone projects that works in the browser and on the server adds the ability to search for models with a query api similar to please report any bugs feature requests in the issue tracker pull requests are welcome compatible with backbone   to   to install include the js and backbone query min js file in your html page after backbone and it s dependencies then extend your collections from backbone querycollection rather than from backbone collection browser js packages and uses require js this is the recommended method of you want to use this library with require js to install simply run jam install backbone query you can install with npm npm install backbone query then simply require in your project querycollection require backbone query querycollection your collections will now have two new methods query and whereby both methods accept  arguments a query object and an options object the query method returns an array of models but the whereby method returns a new collection and is therefore useful where you would like to chain multiple collection the following are some basic examples mycollection query featured true likes gt  and and returns all models where the featured attribute is true and there are and and more than  likes mycollection query tags any coffeescript  backbone  mvc  sortby likes  order desc  limit  page  cache true and and finds models that have either coffeescript  backbone  mvc in their tags attribute and and sorts these models by the likes attribute in descending order and and caches the results and returns only  models starting from the th model page  mycollection query and and models must match all these queries title like news  and and title attribute contains the string news likes gt   and and likes attribute is greater than  and and models must match one of these queries featured true and and featured attribute is true category in code  programming  javascript and and category attribute is either code  programming  or javascript or if coffeescript is your thing the source is written in coffeescript  try this coffeescript mycollection query likes lt  content like news featured exists true colors contains yellow another coffeescript example this time using whereby rather than query coffeescript likes lt  downloads gt  mycollection whereby query mycustomcollectionmethod query api performs a strict equality test using if no operator is provided and the query value isn t a regex then equal is assumed if the attribute in the model is an array then the query value is searched for in the array in the same way as contains if the query value is an object including array then a deep comparison is performed using underscores  isequal javascript mycollection query title test and and returns all models which have a title attribute of test mycollection query title equal test and and same as above mycollection query colors red and and returns models which contain the value red in a colors attribute that is an array mycollection query colors red  yellow and and returns models which contain a colors attribute with the array red  yellow assumes that the model property is an array and searches for the query value in the array mycollection query colors contains red and and returns models which contain the value red in a colors attribute that is an array and and e g a model with this attribute colors red  yellow  blue would be returned not equal  the opposite of equal returns all models which don t have the query value mycollection query title ne test and and returns all models which don t have a title attribute of test these conditional operators can be used for greater than and less than comparisons in queries mycollection query likes lt  and and returns all models which have a likes attribute of less than  mycollection query likes lte  and and returns all models which have a likes attribute of less than or equal to  mycollection query likes gt  and and returns all models which have a likes attribute of greater than  mycollection query likes gte  and and returns all models which have a likes attribute of greater than or equal to  to check if a value is in between  query values use the between operator and supply an array with the min and max value mycollection query likes between  and and returns all models which have a likes attribute of greater than  and less then  an array of possible values can be supplied using in a model will be returned if any of the supplied values is matched mycollection query title in about  home  contact and and returns all models which have a title attribute of either about  home  or contact not in  the opposite of in a model will be returned if none of the supplied values is matched mycollection query title nin about  home  contact and and returns all models which don t have a title attribute of either and and about  home  or contact assumes the model property is an array and only returns models where all supplied values are matched mycollection query colors all red  yellow and and returns all models which have red and yellow in their colors attribute and and a model with the attribute colors red  yellow  blue would be returned and and but a model with the attribute colors red  blue would not be returned assumes the model property is an array and returns models where any of the supplied values are matched mycollection query colors any red  yellow and and returns models which have either red or yellow in their colors attribute assumes the model property has a length i e is either an array or a string only returns models the model property s length matches the supplied values mycollection query colors size  and and returns all models which  values in the colors attribute checks for the existence of an attribute can be supplied either true or false mycollection query title exists true and and returns all models which have a title attribute mycollection query title has false and and returns all models which don t have a title attribute assumes the model attribute is a string and checks if the supplied query value is a substring of the property uses indexof rather than regex for performance reasons mycollection query title like test and and returns all models which have a title attribute that and and contains the string test  e g testing  tests  test  etc the same as above but performs a case insensitive search using indexof and tolowercase still faster than regex mycollection query title likei test and and returns all models which have a title attribute that and and contains the string test  test  test  test  etc checks if the model attribute matches the supplied regular expression the regex query can be supplied without the regex keyword mycollection query content regex and coffeescript and gi and and checks for a regex match in the content attribute mycollection query content and coffeescript and gi and and same as above a callback function can be supplied as a test the callback will receive the attribute and should return either true or false this will be set to the current model this can help with tests against computed properties mycollection query title cb function attr return attr charat  c and and returns all models that have a title attribute that starts with c mycollection query computedtest cb function return this computedproperty  and and returns all models where the computedproperty method returns a value greater than  for callbacks that use this rather than the model attribute the key name supplied is arbitrary and has no effect on the results if the only test you were performing was like the above test it would make more sense to simply use mycollection filter however if you are performing other tests or are using the paging and sorting and caching options of backbone query then this functionality is useful for example you may have a collection of models in with this kind of data stucture var posts new querycollection title home  comments text i like this post  text i love this post  text i hate this post title about  comments text i like this page  text i love this page  text i really like this page to search for posts which have the text really in any of the comments you could search like this posts query comments elemmatch text and really and i all of the operators above can be performed on elemmatch queries e g all  size or lt elemmatch queries also accept compound operators for example this query searches for all posts that have at least one comment without the word really and with the word totally posts query comments elemmatch not text and really and i and text and totally and i this operator allows you to perform queries on computed properties for example you may want to perform a query for a persons full name even though the first and last name are stored separately in your db and model for example testmodel backbone model extend fullname function return this get firstname and and this get lastname a new testmodel firstname dave  lastname tonge b new testmodel firstname john  lastname smith mycollection new querycollection a b mycollection query fullname computed dave tonge and and returns the model with the computed fullname equal to dave tonge mycollection query fullname computed likei john smi and and any of the previous operators can be used including elemmatch is required combined queries  multiple queries can be combined together by default all supplied queries use the and operator however it is possible to specify either or  nor  not to implement alternate logic mycollection query and title like news  likes gt  and and returns all models that contain news in the title and have more than  likes mycollection query title like news  likes gt  and and same as above as and is assumed if not supplied mycollection query or title like news  likes gt  and and returns all models that contain news in the title or have more than  likes the opposite of or mycollection query nor title like news  likes gt  and and returns all models that don t contain news in the title nor have more than  likes the opposite of and mycollection query not title like news  likes gt  and and returns all models that don t contain news in the title and don t have more than  likes if you need to perform multiple queries on the same key then you can supply the query as an array mycollection query or title news  title about and and returns all models with the title news or about compound queries  it is possible to use multiple combined queries for example searching for models that have a specific title attribute and either a category of abc or a tag of xyz mycollection query and title like news  or likes gt   color contains red and and returns models that have news in their title and and and either have more than  likes or contain the color red optional sortby and order attributes can be supplied as part of an options object sortby can either be a model key or a callback function which will be called with each model in the array mycollection query title like news  sortby likes and and returns all models that contain news in the title and and sorted according to their likes attribute ascending mycollection query title like news  sortby likes  order desc and and same as above but descending mycollection query title like news  sortby function model return model get title charat  and and results sorted according to nd character of the title attribute to return only a subset of the results paging properties can be supplied as part of an options object a limit property must be supplied and optionally a offset or a page property can be supplied mycollection query likes gt   limit  and and returns the first  models that have more than  likes mycollection query likes gt   limit  offset  and and returns  models that have more than  likes starting and and at the th model in the results mycollection query likes gt   limit  page  and and returns  models that have more than  likes starting and and at the th model in the results page  when using the paging functionality you will normally need to know the number of pages so that you can render the correct interface for the user backbone query can send the number of pages of results to a supplied callback the callback should be passed as a pager property on the options object this callback will also receive the sliced models as a second variable here is a coffeescript example of a simple paging setup using the pager callback option coffeescript class myview extends backbone view initialize template templating setup here events click page changepage querycollection page  collection should be passed in when the view is instantiated collection query category javascript  limit  page page pager renderpages changepage e pagenumber e target data pagenumber querycollection pagenumber renderpages totalpages results content template results pages  totalpages nav nav span total pages totalpages and span  for page in pages nav and and nav el html content and nav render querycollection caching results  to enable caching set the cache flag to true in the options object this can greatly improve performance when paging through results as the unpaged results will be saved this options is not enabled by default as if models are changed added to or removed from the collection then the query cache will be out of date if you know that your data is static and won t change then caching can be enabled without any problems if your data is dynamic as in most backbone apps then a helper cache reset method is provided resetquerycache this method should be bound to your collections change add and remove events depending on how your data can be changed cache will be saved in a querycache property on each collection where a cache query is performed mycollection query likes gt   limit  page  cache true and and the first query will operate as normal and return the first page of results mycollection query likes gt   limit  page  cache true and and the second query has an identical query object to the first query so therefore the results will be retrieved and and from the cache before the paging paramaters are applied and and binding the resetquerycache method var mycollection backbone

6538491, corebluetooth peripheral example  updated  november  a demonstration of using corebluetooth using bluetoothe   le on the osx and ios on the osx side corebluetoothosxcentral implements the client as a corebluetooth central that scans for suitable bluetooth   le peripherals once it discovers one it will try and connect and subscribe to a fixed service characterstic once it receives a notification from the peripheral it subscribes to it will immediately unsubscribe on the ios side corebluetootheiosperipheral implements the server as a corebluetooth peripheral that advertises a fixed service characteristic once a central osx connects to the service and subscribes to notifications on the characteristic it will send a hello message to the subscriber basic bluetooth   terminology  bluetooth central this is the node that is trying to connect to a data source think of this as the client bluetooth peripheral this is the node that is providing the primary data source think of this as the server characteristic a characteristic can be considered a variable service a group of characteristics live under a service implemented  central scanning for peripherals connecting to a peripheral disconnecting from a peripheral discovering services discovering characteristics of a service subscribing to a characteristic receiving data from a characteristic peripheral advertising a service and characteristic adding service and characteristic to the peripheralmanager detecting of new subscribers to a characteristics detecting of unsubscribing handling of unready state of the device currently unimplemented  to keep the implementation simple this demonstration does not implement static read and write characteristics multiple characteristics implementation notes and caveats  according to apple if you add bluetooth central or bluetooth peripheral to uibackgroundmodes in the info plist  the application will continue to run in the background and receive cbcentralmanagerdelegate and and or cbperipheralmanagerdelegate events i ve not fully discovered the behaviour here but i ve advertised services disappear from the advertisments even though the application is still running in the background some times they exist with no hassles at all sometimes the services are dropped by the service name still exists sometimes everything is dropped even the generic services it s quite mysterious when it is working and when it is not more investigation needed as of osx   the corebluetooth apis only allow you to have your mac act as a central on ios   the ios device can act as either a peripheral or a central if an ios device is implementing a peripheral  consider using uuids that are only  characters short  bytes cbuuid serviceuuid cbuuid uuidwithstring  the advertisement packet sent is max  bytes or  bytes including the name if your uuids exceed that then the service will not be discoverable if cbcentralmanager scans with no specific service uuids managed scanforperipheralswithservices nil see cbperipheralmanager h for details if you are implementing the cbcentralmanager on ios you can also look in the overflow advertisment data field cbadvertisementdataoverflowserviceuuidskey in the advertismentdata dictionary void centralmanager cbcentralmanager central diddiscoverperipheral cbperipheral peripheral advertisementdata nsdictionary advertisementdata rssi nsnumber rssi nsarray overflowserviceuuids advertismentdata objectforkey cbadvertisementdataoverflowserviceuuidskey   when scanning for peripherals from cbcentralmanager when you receive a centralmanager diddiscoverperipheral advertismentdata rssi message you should look in the advertismentdata dictionary for the cbadvertisementdataserviceuuidskey for the advertised services rather than in the peripheral services property the peripheral services property will not be filled in until you call cbcentralmanager discoverservices void centralmanager cbcentralmanager central diddiscoverperipheral cbperipheral peripheral advertisementdata nsdictionary advertisementdata rssi nsnumber rssi nsarray serviceuuids advertismentdata objectforkey cbadvertisementdataserviceuuidskey for cbuuid foundserviceuuids in serviceuuids if self serviceuuids containsobject foundserviceuuids foundsuitableperipheral yes break    sometimes if the ios application acting as the peripheral is in the background the services for it removed from the advertisment packet in that case if you call cbperipheral discoverservices with an array of services it may not return any services if you use long uuids eg using uuidgen  then you will run in to endianess issues between ios and the mac this is a bug in xcode   and reportedly fixed in xcode    despite that was said in the wwdc talk the subsequent betas for ios   will not call centraldidconnect and centraldiddisconnect on the cbperipheralmanagerdelegate you can have a characteristic that is both readable and notifiable this example does not do this but presumably you can set the property of using the bitmask cbcharacteristicpropertyread and cbcharacteristicpropertynotify if you do not retain the cbperipheral you get in the central implementation when you call connectperipheral it will silently fail this is surprising because you d think connectperipheral would retain the cbperipheral in the demo you ll note that i retain the cbperipheral for time out purposes but if i didn t do that cbcentralmanager connectperipheral will silently fail in the wwdc presentation reconnecting to the device by uuid is mentiond however if the peripheral is an iphone the uuid changes if bluetooth is turned on and off again on the device the uuid stays consistent if the app is killed and restarted if you remove a service while a central is connected to the peripheral like through a subscribed characteristic then the central does not get a disconnection the peripheral will also lose track of the subscribers for a characteristic even if the characteristic has the same uuid that is don t do this self peripheralmanager removeservice self currentservice self peripheralmanager addservice self currentservice i ran in to this when i would listen for didsubscribe and then prompt the user to bring the peripheral implementation to the foreground when i returned to the foreground i had code that re enabled the service that would check if self currentservice existed and if so removed the service and readded it again that was not a good idea other resources  the code only works for readvalue and writevalue but not seemingly for subscribe sample code rebooting phone fixes not notifying on subscribable properties

6459782, slomojs is an attempt to make learning javascript and computational thinking easier by making the execution of js code more transparent traditionally this is accomplished by peppering code with console log statements and and or using a debugger however the former approach requires lots of extra code and the latter approach presents novice users with a complex modal user interface with libraries like esprima and falafel  however we can monitor the execution of js to do things in browser that only debuggers are traditionally capable of this allows us to potentially create innovative new solutions provide significant insight to the execution of running code without the hassles associated with traditional approaches and without the need for users to install custom software i originally wanted to use popcorn to generate a movie of the user s code being executed but given edward tufte s belief that it s usually better to have information adjacent in space rather than stacked in time which is yet another problem with traditional debuggers i decided to make the visualization purely spatial rather than temporal infinite loops are prevented by mangling the user s code to check running time at the beginning of each iteration of a loop and throwing an exception if it s taking too long lots of things can still be made more transparent getting and setting the attributes of objects for instance the mangling being done by the code disables some js semantics all variables must be formally declared in a var statement for instance and function declarations are automatically converted to var statements with function expression initializers hoisting is also broken

5464728, undergarment  a slide out navigation a k a drawer implementation for android applications the slide out navigation pattern has been popping up in all sorts of places in the android ecosystem lately in all sorts of shapes and sizes undergarment initially started with me mimicking the experience found in the prixing application as documented by cyril mottier on the subject just recently august   the android team updated their design site specifically with a new pattern documenting the slide out navigation every developer and their dog had been playing around with to that date thusly the drawer pattern was born you can find the android team s documentation regarding the drawer pattern under the of the action bar patterns page now as the prixing implementation dealt with sliding the entire window action bar and all over to the side in order to reveal the drawer while the pattern on the android design site used the youtube app as a reference which slides only the content portion over and keeps the action bar stationary my implementation was a bit lacking so i added support for sliding just the content portion over moved the implementation into a standalone android library project and put it on github that s the story of how undergarment was born using such  i m a fan of git submodules and intellij  so in order to use this library i recommend adding this repository as a submodule of your encompassing project s repository git submodule add git and and github com and eddieringle and android undergarment contrib and android undergarment now add the undergarment library as a module in intellij and add that module as a dependency of your project you re then ready to start using undergarment integrating undergarment is fairly straightforward in the oncreate of the activity hosting the undergarment a k a drawer do a little something like this mdrawergarment new drawergarment this r layout dashboard the constructor takes two arguments the first being the activity that hosts the undergarment and the second being a resource identifier to the layout that will define the drawer contents by default undergarment is set to slide the entire window over action bar and all if you wish to switch to the youtube style of only sliding over the content then you can set it like so mdrawergarment setslidetarget drawergarment slidetargetcontent when the drawer is first attached to the view hierarchy undergarment sets the background color of the content view to color white the reason it is not transparent or left alone is because the drawer would otherwise show through to the content view making things look messy and such if a white background won t work and for instance red is more your style you can change it like so mdrawergarment setdecorcontentbackgroundcolor color red mdrawergarment reconfigureviewhierarchy to open and close the drawer call the opendrawer and closedrawer methods respectively you can also toggle the drawer state with the toggledrawer method the user will also be able to control the drawer by bezel swiping from the left side of the screen to open the drawer and doing the same from the right to close it if you want to prevent this touch functionality you can call setdrawerenabled false finally you can provide callbacks to the drawer that will fire when the drawer is opened or closed which allows you to do useful things such as modifying the state of the action bar to set the callbacks implement the drawergarment idrawercallbacks interface and add them to the drawer with setdrawercallbacks callbacks

called following conceptual topics implementing multiple routes factoring out constants and settings into separate files factoring out secure server side configuration variables into env files using async series to force a database update followed by a launch of the webserver using async maplimit and async eachlimit to limit the number of simultaneous queries to a remote api and to a database respectively using asynchronous code to set up a recurring background process a daemon visualizing orm instances in the browser making a request to a remote api both on the server and in client side code setting up a simple api reusing code by putting object manipulation code into instance and class methods setting up a basic angularjs controller let s install the app and then take a tour of the functionality to get the app up and running execute the following commands on your ec instance exit and then log in again cd bitstarter leaderboard and setup ssjs sh once you have done this you will need to  copy the env dummy env dummy file into env and include your api snippet below note that coinbaseapikey is a secure api key that should never be checked into a git repository that s why we exclude it in the gitignore gitignore cp env dummy env emacs nw env add key from coinbase com and account and integrations cat env coinbaseapikey cbeefafddeabbbdcffd port   edit the constants js constants js file to include the code that is meant to be embedded in a public facing webpage so it s ok if you check this into git coinbasepreorderdatacode bbeabfefbccc   now you can run the server locally and preview at a url like foreman start you can determine the hostname of your ec instance conveniently with this try placing some orders and then going to the and orders url at the top to see them recorded also refresh the page to see the thermometer update note that you will get an error if you didn t do the env step above once the app works via foreman start on your ec machine you can deploy to heroku and push the configuration variables defined in env as follows git push heroku master heroku config push orders to test it out note again that you will get an invalid api key error if you didn t do the env step above let s begin by taking a quick look at the files in the app first the major differences from are as follows index html is now replaced by the more sophisticated views and homepage ejs template pgpass has a newline added to it and a corresponding css and js have been pulled out of index html and into public and css and public and js a good deal of content has been added to the static files directory to reduce the number of http requests to external servers now let s go file by file and path and description and and and and and env dummy env dummy and used as

orderpage ejs and template for the order page served up for example com and orders and and web js web js and initialize express app syncs db and start http server and web js web js routes js routes js to see how we set up the app and the valid routes we ve also factored out many static assets into subdirectories into and public public and recall again that static assets are files that do not change when users request example com and img and x gif they will get the same file every time a static response by contrast a web page with content that changes based on client or server side parameters is a dynamic web page for example when a user requests example com and orders they will see something that depends on the state of the database and thus will vary over time note that in routes js routes js  we try to separate the code that handles requests and responses from the code that actually manipulates instances of the order models and order js class this illustrates a general principle as much as possible you should ask objects to manipulate themselves with instance methods and and or class methods rather than try to work with an object s guts externally see models and order js models and order js for details of doing this we ll talk more about how this is done in the orm section dborm postgresql and sequelize replaces m in mean below but for now note that most request handlers have the form of asking global db for some data and then packing that data into an http response of some kind in sum express is used here to organize the functions that are executed on the server to generate an http response from an http request that is to structure our webapp for illustrative purposes we do two kinds of templating in this app server side templating of views and homepage ejs views and homepage ejs and views and orderpage ejs views and orderpage ejs  and client side templating in the thermometer on the homepage via angular js also in views and homepage ejs views and homepage ejs l let s talk about server side templating first the specific templating engine here is set up in web js web js  where we tell express that ejs app set view engine  ejs web js l consider indexfn routes js l in routes js this uses views and homepage ejs and populate it with a json data structure specifically the response render invocation routes js l looks for variables in views and homepage ejs like coinbasepreorderdatacode views and homepage ejs l and replaces them with the corresponding field of the json data structure as defined in constants js constants js l it then wraps this in an http response and returns it to the client a slightly more complex example is in orderfn routes js l  also in routes js here we use the ordersjson json data structure to populate the views and orderpage ejs file via response render  similar to what we did in indexfn the main difference is that we put this logic in a callback and send it into global db order alltojson models and order js l  executing it right after the orders variable is built up via orm and database operations these two examples illustrate the basic idea of server side templating rather than returning a fully static file like public and img and x gif  we separate out the static and dynamic portions we put the parts that don t change the static parts into a template like views and orderpage ejs and then populate this template dynamically with the remainder returning the response to the client all of this is done on the server and the computation is invisible to the client they can t view the orders variable directly for example by looking at in the chrome developer tools they just see one http response in response to their http request in this app we have a simple postgresql relational database underlying the app that keeps a local mirror of the remote order data on coinbase s servers we create the db by running setup ssjs sh setup ssjs sh  which in turn invokes pgsetup sh pgsetup sh we interface with this database via the sequelize object relational mapper orm  which provides a javascript api to a relational database the following figure provides an overview take a look at it and then read the subsequent documentation while this kind of setup is canonical it s worth asking a few questions about why a relational database and object relational mapper combination is so common in web applications today why use a db first you might ask why we don t simply keep the order data in a simple json file and then reload it when the app boots up this is the so called flatfile approach we could certainly do this but as our app scales and we get more and more data this approach has issues for one thing we would find it painful to modify the json file simultaneously if we had multiple web servers writing to the same dataset for another a naive json file saved on disk will be very slow to search as a third point we may wish to extract information from this json file in a different manner from the way in which we saved it each of these things parallelized reads and writes rapid searching and easy reporting via the structured query language sql is facilitated by converting our data from flatfiles and keeping it in a relational database like postgresql why use an orm with the db second given that we are using a relational database you might then ask why we don t simply interface directly with the relational database via a low level library like node postgres  which allows us to run sql statements directly against the database why take on the overhead of an object relational mapper like sequelize the answer is that the so called active record paradigm is a good match for many webapps in a nutshell the idea is that it is often very useful to conceive of tables in a relational database as mapping directly to classes while rows of these tables contain the data for instances in this framework the entire database can be thought of as an elaborate serialization and deserialization apparatus for javascript objects you rehydrate individual instances of js classes from disk during the life of a program and then dehydrate them and put them in cold storage the relational database when no longer needed in memory that said it s important to keep in mind that an orm is a convenience and not a panacea just as with flatfiles it is true that sometimes the active record paradigm breaks down and you need to directly interface with the database via sql statements for performance reasons or because you re doing some sort of report or dashboard that accesses the data via columns even though you saved it across rows why use a relational db rather than a nosql db as a third point you might note that this combination of sequelize and postgresql replaces the mongoose and mongodb combination which is the m in the mean stack why don t mongoose and mongodb combo well mongoose and mongodb is certainly one way to go if you really want a completely full stack js app however postgresql has excellent support for js and json nowadays and is more mature than mongodb moreover the advantages of a so called schemaless or nosql approach are greatest at the beginning of an app when the but eventually it actually becomes useful to have a schema to catch errors and prevent invalid operations you will often find yourself reinventing a schema in code if you go down the mongodb path albeit without the extent of low level schema support provided by a relational db like postgresql once we ve decided on an orm and db combination in general we want to keep most code related to manipulating data from the database in the corresponding class or instance methods in our case in models and order js as a rough rule of thumb class methods operate on every instance in the class e g counts and totals  while instance methods access data associated with particular instances so as an example you d use a class method like order totals to sum up the total amount of bitcoin sent over all orders while you d use an instance method like a hypothetical myorder amountinusd method to determine the equivalent usd amount for a given order in btc the latter method call needs the amount data on a specific order instance so it should be an instance method though you might request and cache the exchange rate itself via a class method we put these class and instance method definitions in order js  within the the value of this within a class method it refers to the entire class in this case order while within an instance method it refers to a particular instance e g myorder sometimes you need to save this variable and pass it in to a callback we do this in addfromjson to make the order class accessible within a callback that runs on each individual instance finally here are some examples of working with the orm in the node repl and and execute from within the top level directory after pgsetup require and models global db order numorders executing select count as count from orders there are  orders var foo global db order findall success function orders global foo push orders var orders foo  orders  repr coinbaseid xzqol  amount   time   t      id  createdat fri aug      gmt and  utc  updatedat fri aug      gmt and  utc we previously discussed server side templating and how we combine a static template from order ejs or homepage ejs with dynamic json data to create a dynamic http response that varies with the state of the database if you recall our homepage ejs was partially templated on the server side in the indexfn within routes js by replacement of the portions surrounded by special brackets like the value of name below span class icon bar and span span class icon bar and span and button ul class nav however you might have noticed an alternative bracket syntax coexisting within the homepage ejs file as shown surrounding numorders below different in horizontal and vertical layouts illustrating media queries and div and div this is because in homepage ejs we are also using a second kind of templating client side templating it is similar in concept to server side templating except the population of the static template with the json data occurs on the client side among other things this means the client has access to a json api that is returning some data in this app the place that we re doing some client side templating is in the thermometer element the data that comes from and api and orders is being used to update the thermometer if you submit an order in a separate window and wait for the coinbase data to be refreshed via the setinterval daemon in web js or manually refresh it yourself by requesting and refreshorders  the thermometer will then update upon a homepage refresh you can think of this client side templating implementation as simply populating the template variables in homepage ejs with data on the client side rather than on the server but things are a little more complicated than that we re actually using a sophisticated than simple templating it actually does full on two way basic difference between one way templating and two way databinding is that in one way templating the data is just used to populate variables in a template e g homepage ejs in two way databinding however actions on elements of a templated page like clicking a button or typing into a form field can in turn change the underlying data indeed you can set it up such that the same data is editable from several different places within a aren t using all the features of two way databinding in our thermometer but it s worth understanding how angular works in a simple use case to trace through the logic of how we re using angular in our simple app let s start with the four angular directives that we re using in homepage ejs ng app  ng show  ng style  and ng controller first we put ng app at the top of the file and include angular min js once the javascript from angular min js is parsed and run by the browser it will look through the dom find the ng app declaration and treat everything underneath that node as subject to control and updating by angular for simplicity in this case we put ng app at the very top node in the html tag doctype html html lang en ng app head meta charset utf  title title and title meta name viewport content width device width initial scale   then towards the middle of the file we use three directives ng show  ng style  and ng controller of these ng controller is the most important it sets up a relationship between this div and the code in public and js and controllers js  which defines the ordersctrl function if you look at public and js and controllers js public and js and controllers js  it initiates an http request to and api and orders  and uses the results to set up variables like numorders and totalfunded it then uses these variables to populate the template expressions like numorders we use the ng show directive to set up conditional logic on the basis of whether or not the ordersctrl function call returned an error or not if it did not error then we display the thermometer stats if an error was returned we display an error message finally ng style is used to apply a css style to an element dynamically based on one of the variables set up by ordersctrl  namely percentagefunded different in horizontal and vertical layouts illustrating media queries and div and div and div and div and div and div and div h error and h and div and div and div and div and div and div data button style customlarge data button text preorder with bitcoin data custom finished order data code coinbasepreorderdatacode and div and div and div and div and div to trace through the logic of how the thermometer data is populated see the and api and orders route in the next section the following figures illustrate how the server side and client side components of the app work together by tracing the path of the four routes implemented in our app and  and api and order  and refreshorders  and and orders and warning these figures are large you can also download pdf versions here first let s take a look at how an http request to example com and is handled by our app this about as simple as it gets in terms of generating a dynamic http response from an http request there s no database interaction and a simple template is populated with some constant json data and returned to the client now let s look at a more complicated route an http request to and orders this request now involves hitting the database via the orm and using that data to populate the orderpage ejs template this is perhaps the most common way to generate a dynamic response now let s increase the level of complexity a little more and show how to implement a route that doesn t directly return an http response but that redirects to the and orders route after performing a database operation finally let s take a look at a fairly sophisticated route this route is never meant to be called directly by the end user it s actually used by the client side code in the thermometer on the front page to refresh itself from the latest set of orders in the database

12917308, this repository contains an exciting quest to learn about web security by learning about vulnerabilities exploiting them and then crafting code to protect against them before embarking on this adventure make sure you have the skills taught in learnyounode and levelmeup also make sure phantomjs is installed and on your path as well as node   and npm start the adventure like so sudo npm install g security adventure security adventure that s all there is to it the security adventure program will instruct you further alternatively you can clone this git repository and follow the instructions in the rest of this readme cd security adventure npm install cp app vulnerable js app js app js is a full web application in about  lines of code that allows users to create password protected accounts and store private plaintext notes in the cloud yourself with the behavior of the application by creating a user and saving some notes then read the source of app js to get a basic idea of how everything works app js contains lots of vulnerabilities and your quest is to learn about and fix all of them the regular expression used to validate usernames has a regular expression denial of service redos vulnerability in it read about this vulnerability and then try exploiting it manually by visiting the app in your browser and entering an invalid username that will cause the app to hang then fix app js run bin and verify js redos to verify that your solution works the home page of the app accepts a msg querystring argument containing a hex encoded status message to display this is used for instance when users fail to authenticate properly and the server needs to provide feedback this isn t exactly a best practice for various reasons but most importantly it contains a reflected cross site scripting reflected vulnerability read about the vulnerability and then try crafting a url that when visited causes a logged in user s browser to display an alert dialog that contains their session cookie accessible through document cookie cookie theft is a particularly big danger because it allows attackers to do anything on a user s behalf whenever they want so first mitigate the effects of xss vulnerabilities by modifying sessioncookie serialize in app js to issue httponly cookies manually test your solution by loading your specially crafted url from the previous section you shouldn t see the session cookie in that alert dialog anymore you will have to log out and log back in for the httponly cookie to be set properly run bin and verify js httponly to verify that your solution works it s nice that the damage that can be done via the xss attack is somewhat mitigated but it s way better to prevent the attack entirely the content security policy csp specification is one of the most awesome security innovations to come to browsers in recent years it allows servers to change the default allowances for what kinds of script can be executed and even what kinds of embedded resources such as iframes images and style sheets can be included in a page this is in accordance with the principle of least authority pola  which is a good best practice for any secure system since our app doesn t actually have any client side script or embedded content we can enforce the most restrictive csp possible by setting the content security policy header to default src none once you ve done this load your specially crafted url again you shouldn t even see an alert dialog and your browser s debugging console might even explain why your js wasn t executed run bin and verify js csp to verify that your solution works csp is only available on the most modern browsers and we need to protect users on older ones too besides that of course we actually want to display the message content in a correct and useful way this can be done by properly escaping the untrusted input coming in from the msg querystring argument the owasp xss prevention cheat sheet xss cheat sheet is indispensable here check it out and use a reliable function like underscore s  escape to escape the msg argument before inserting it into your html note that if you decide to use underscore you ll want to install it first using npm install underscore run bin and verify js html escaping to verify that your solution works cookies are a form of ambient authority  which means that they get sent with every request to a website even when that request comes from a different website consider a website called killyournotes com which contains the following body onload document forms  submit input type hidden name notes value gotcha and form every user logged in to your application would immediately have their notes deleted whenever they visited killyournotes com try doing this now copy the above text and paste it into an html file anywhere then visit the file in your browser and see what happens this is called a cross site request forgery csrf csrf because it involves another site forging a request to your application and taking advantage of the ambient authority provided by cookies in security parlance your application has unwittingly become a confused deputy this exploit can be protected against by requiring that every incoming request that changes your application s state e g a post request also come with an explicit token guaranteeing that the request indeed came from a page on your site and not someone else s to complete this mission you ll need to do a number of things when a get request arrives at your application check to see if the session has a value called csrftoken if it doesn t create one using crypto randombytes and set the session cookie whenever your site displays a form add a hidden input with the name csrftoken to the form and set its value to that of session csrftoken whenever your site processes a post request ensure that the incoming form data has a value for csrftoken that matches that of session csrftoken if it doesn t return a  forbidden reponse code once you ve done this your exploit should result in a  instead of deleting the current user s notes and your application should still retain all existing functionality run bin and verify js csrf to verify that your solution works you ve completed all the challenges so far you can verify that your app js protects against all the problems you ve solved and still retains its basic functionality by running bin and verify js all if you want to learn more about web security you should read michal zalewski s the tangled web tangled it is hilarious and very educational app vulnerable js intentionally contains a number of owasp defined security vulnerabilities that aren t currently part of the quest such as sensitive data exposure sde for password storage insecure direct object references idor and broken authentication and session management brokenauth for session keys learners should first exploit these vulnerabilities so they understand how they work and then modify the code to implement defenses against them ideally the tutorial will also teach users about more recent innovations in browser security such as http strict transport security hsts it should also teach developers how to use security tools like the zed attack proxy zap to easily detect for vulnerabilities in their own applications by the end of the tutorial users will have familiarized themselves with a variety of types of attacks the will also have familiarized themselves with the owasp website and will be equipped to independently learn about security in the future

550530,   flow js provides a continuation esque construct that makes it much easier to express multi step asynchronous logic in non blocking callback heavy environments like node js or javascript in the web browser the concept is best explained with an example the following code uses a simple asynchronous key store to look up a user s id from his username and then sets his email address first name and last name in this example the dbget and dbset functions are assumed to rely on asynchronous i and o and both take a callback that is called upon completion dbget useridof bobvance  function userid dbset user and userid and email  bobvance potato egg  function dbset user and userid and firstname  bob  function dbset user and userid and lastname  vance  function okwearedone notice how every single step requires another nested function definition a four step process like the one shown here is fairly awkward imagine how painful a  step process would be one might point out that there is no reason to wait for one dbset to complete before calling the next but assuming we don t want okwearedone to be called until all three calls to dbset are finished we d need some logic to manage that dbget useridof bobvance  function userid var completecount  var complete function completecount and  if completecount  okwearedone dbset user and userid and email  bobvance potato egg  complete dbset user and userid and firstname  bob  complete dbset user and userid and lastname  vance  complete now look at the same example using flow js flow exec function dbget useridof bobvance  this function userid dbset user and userid and email  bobvance potato egg  this multi dbset user and userid and firstname  bob  this multi dbset user and userid and lastname  vance  this multi function okwearedone a flow consists of a series of functions each of which is applied with a special this object which serves as a callback to the next function in the series in cases like our second step this multi can be used to generate a callback that won t call the next function until all such callbacks have been called installing  flow js is a commonjs compatible module place the flow js file in any directory listed in your require paths array and require it like this var flow require flow or you can just put flow js next to your script and do this var flow require and flow defining a flow  flow define defines a flow given any number of functions as parameters it returns a function that can be used to execute that flow more than once whatever parameters are passed each time that flow is called are passed as the parameters to the first function in the flow each function in the flow is called with a special this object which maintains the state of the flow s execution acts as a container for saving values for use between functions in the flow and acts as a callback to the next function in the flow here is an example to make this clear and and define a flow for renaming a file and then printing its stats var renameandstat flow define function fromname toname and and arguments passed to renameandstat will pass through to this first function this toname toname and and save to be used in the next function fs rename fromname toname this function err and and when fs rename calls the special this callback above this function will be called and and whatever arguments fs rename chooses to pass to the callback will pass through to this function if err throw err and and the this here is the same as in the function above so this toname is available fs stat this toname this function err stats and and when fs stat calls the this callback above this function will be called and and whatever arguments fs stat chooses to pass to the callback will pass through to this function if err throw err sys puts stats and json stringify stats and and now renameandstat can be used more than once renameandstat and tmp and hello  and tmp and world renameandstat and tmp and hello  and tmp and world executing a flow just once  flow exec is a convenience function that defines a flow and executes it immediately passing no arguments to the first function here s a simple example very similar to the one above flow exec function fs rename and tmp and hello  and tmp and world  this function err if err throw err fs stat and tmp and world  this function err stats if err throw err sys puts stats and json stringify stats multiplexing  sometimes it makes sense for a step in a flow to initiate several asynchronous tasks and then wait for all of those tasks to finish before continuing to the next step in the flow this can be accomplished by passing this multi as the callback rather than just this here is an example of this multi in action repeated from the overview flow exec function dbget useridof bobvance  this function userid dbset user and userid and email  bobvance potato egg  this multi dbset user and userid and firstname  bob  this multi dbset user and userid and lastname  vance  this multi function okwearedone you can identify the results of a function by passing a result identifier to multi the results of a function can retrieved using this key in the final step the result will be a single value if callback receives  or  argument otherwise it will be an array of arguments passed to the callback example flow exec function dbget useridof bobvance  this multi bob dbget useridof joohndoe  this multi john function results dbset user and results bob and email  bobvance potato egg dbset user and results john and email  joohndoe potato egg okwearedone in many cases you may simply discard the arguments passed to each of the callbacks generated by this multi  but if you need them they are accessible as an array of arguments objects passed as the first argument of the next function each arguments object will be appended to the array as it is received so the order will be unpredictable for most asynchronous apis here s a quick example that checks for errors flow exec function fs rename and tmp and a  and tmp and   this multi fs rename and tmp and b  and tmp and   this multi fs rename and tmp and c  and tmp and   this multi function argsarray argsarray foreach function args if args  then throw args  serialforeach  flow js comes with a convience function called flow serialforeach which can be used to apply an asynchronous function to each element in an array of values serially flow serialforeach      function val keystore increment counter  val this function error newval if error throw error sys puts newval and newval function sys puts this is the end flow serialforeach takes an array like object a function to be called for each item in the array a function that receives the callback values after each iteration and a function that is called after the entire process is finished both of the second two functions are optional flow serialforeach is actually implemented with flow define

36971, mode markdown vim filetype none tw  expandtab etorrent is a bittorrent client written in erlang the focus is on robustness and scalability in number of torrents rather than in pure speed etorrent is mostly meant for unattended operation where one just specifies what files to download and gets a notification when they are flag days are when you need to do something to your setup    you will need a rebar with commit bcd as we got some fixes into rebar    we now depend on riakerr you will need to regrab dependencies    the fast resume file format has been updated you may have to delete your fastresumefile though the system was configured to do a silent system upgrade currently we are running build bots through etorrent was mostly conceived as an experiment in how easy it would be to write a bittorrent client in erlang the hypothesis is that the code will be cleaner and smaller than comparative bittorrent clients the code is at this point somewhat mature it has been used in several scenarios with a good host of different clients and trackers the code base is not known to act as a bad pp citizen although it may be possible that it is the most important missing link currently is that only a few users have been testing it so there may still be bugs in the code the master branch has been quite stable for months now however so it is time to get some more users for testing please report any bugs especially if the client behaves badly bep  the bittorrent protocol specification bep  known number allocations bep  dht protocol bep  extension protocol bep  multitracker metadata extension bep  udp tracker protocol bep  tracker returns compact peer lists rebar you need a working rebar installation to build etorrent the rebar must have commit bcd it is known that rebar version rebar version  date  vcs git ebda works and later versions probably will too erlang and otp rb or r the etorrent system is written in erlang and thus requires a working erlang distribution to work it may work with older versions but has mostly been tested with newer versions if you have the option running on rb is preferred the developers are usually running on fairly recent erlang and otp releases so you have much better chances with these systems a unix derivative or windows as the operating system support has been tested by mulander and is reported to work with some manual labor for details see the windows getting started section  make deps pull the relevant dependencies into deps and  make compile this compiles the source code  make rel this creates an embedded release in rel and etorrent which can subsequently be moved to a location at your leisure  edit editor rel and etorrent and etc and app config there are a number of directories which must be set in order to make the system work  check editor rel and etorrent and etc and vm args erlang args to supply  be sure to protect the erlang cookie or anybody can connect to  run rel and etorrent and bin and etorrent console  drop a torrent file in the watched dir and see what happens  call etorrent help from the erlang cli to get a list of available commands  obviously get and install erlang from erlang org this process was tested with rb release you may want to add the bin directory to your path in order to reduce the length of the commands you will enter later on the installer hang on me midway through the process but the libs were properly copied to c windows system  confirm that your crypto works correctly by running crypto start from an erlang shell start erlang otp rb erlang the shell should respond with ok if you get an error then your openssl libraries are still missing  open up a git bash shell and cd to a directory you want to work in  from a regular cmd exe shell cd rebar now if you added the erlang bin directory to your path then you can simply run bootstrap bat if you didn t add erlang s bin to your path then issue the following command c program files erl   bin escript exe bootstrap adjust the path to your erlang installation directory from now on use this invocation for escript exe and erl exe i ll assume it s on path you should now have a rebar file created if you have erlangs bin dir on your path then you may want to also add the rebar directory to your path this will allow you to use the rebar bat script which will also reduce the amount of typing you will have to do  clone etorrent and copy the rebar file into it unless you have it on path  now we need to satisfy the dependencies this should be done by rebar itself but i couldn t get it to work correctly with git this point describes how to do it manually mkdir deps this is where rebar will look for etorrent dependencies escript exe rebar check deps this will give you a list of the missing dependencies and their git repos for each dependency reported by check deps perform the following command in a git bash shell be sure to be in the etorrent directory git clone git and and pathtorepo and name git deps and name be sure to run escript exe rebar check deps after cloning each additional repo as new dependencies might be added by them for the time of this writing    i had to clone the following repositories git clone git and and github com and esl and gproc git deps and gproc git clone git and and github com and esl and edown git deps and edown git clone git and and github com and basho and riakerr git deps and riakerr  escript exe rebar compile to compile the application from a cmd exe prompt  escript exe rebar generate this creates an embedded release in rel and etorrent which can subsequently be moved to a location at your leisure this command may take some time so be patient  edit rel and etorrent and etc and app config there are a number of directories which must be set in order to make the system work be sure each directory exists before starting etorrent you also have to change all paths starting with and ie and var and lib when setting paths use forward slashes for example dir d and etorrent and torrents   check rel and etorrent and etc and vm args erlang args to supply  be sure to protect the erlang cookie or anybody can connect to  we can t run the etorrent script because it s written in bash so in order to start ettorent cd from a cmd exe shell into the rel etorrent directory and perform the following command erts    bin erl exe boot release    etorrent embedded config etc app config argsfile etc vm args be sure to substitute the version number in the release path to the current etorrent release version do the same for the erts version allow port communication when and if the windows firewall asks for it  drop a torrent file in the watched dir and see what happens  call etorrent help from the erlang cli to get a list of available commands read the document etorrent and test md and jlouis and etorrent and tree and master and test md for how to run tests of the system if the above commands doesn t work we want to hear about it this is a list of known problems general many distributions are insane and pack erlang in split packages so each part of erlang is in its own package this always leads to build problems due to missing stuff be sure you have all relevant packages installed and when you find which packages are needed please send a patch to this file for the distribution and version so we can keep it up to date ubuntu   ubuntu has a symlink and usr and lib and erlang and man and usr and share and man this is insane and generates problems when building a release spec errors on missing files if a symlink points to nowhere the easiest fix is to remove the man symlink from and usr and lib and erlang a way better fix is to install a recent erlang and otp yourself and use begone tm on the supplied version i jlouis use the following commands to install erlang install stow  sudo aptitude install stow execute sudo aptitude build dep erlang to pull in all build dependencies we need execute git clone git and and github com and erlang and otp git get into the directory and fire away git checkout dev and otpbuild autoconf get a useful tag for the otp version you have built otpversion git describe and configure prefix and usr and local and stow and otpversion make make docs make install install docs and then i enable it in stow cd and usr and local and stow stow otpversion you may have to use stow d on an old and kerl build rb rb and kerl install rb and opt and erlang and rb and opt and erlang and rb and activate you can either mail them to jesper louis andersen gmail com or you can come by on irc etorrent and freenode and ask to submit patches we have documentation in documentation and git md  giving tips to patch submitters when developing for etorrent you might end up generating a new environment quite often so ease the configuration the build infrastructure support this create a file rel and vars and etorrent devvars config based upon the file rel and vars config run make compile etorrent dev run make console notice that we pa add and and apps and etorrent and ebin so you can l mod files from the shell directly into the running system after having recompiled them read the hacking md file in this directory for how the git repository is worked see documentation and git md either mail them to jesper louis andersen gmail com we are this is the original protocol specification tracked into the bep process it is worth reading because it explains the general overview and the precision with which the original protocol was written down the bep process is an official process for adding extensions on top of the bittorrent protocol it allows implementors to mix and match the extensions making sense for their client and it allows people to discuss extensions publicly in a forum it also provisions for the deprecation of certain features in the long run as they prove to be of less value an alternative description of the protocol this description is in general much more detailed than the bep structure it is worth a read because it acts somewhat as a historic remark and a side channel note that there are some commentary on these pages which can be disputed quite a lot

8918474, a keyboard accessory view that blends in with the default ios keyboard providing an additional set of customisable keys there are a couple of ways to include quayboard in your xcode project this method is demonstrated in the included example project example and quayboardexample xcodeproj  drag the quayboard xcodeproj file into your project navigator   from the finder this should add quayboard as a subproject of your own project denoted by the fact that it appears as in a rectangle and you should be able to browse the project structure  in your project s target under the build phases tab add libquayboard a under link binary with libraries  while you re in the build phases tab add libquayboard a and quayboardresources bundle under target dependencies  expand the quayboard subproject and drag the quayboardresources bundle into your copy bundle resources build phase  under the build settings tab of you project s target do a search for header search paths add the path to the and src and quayboard and folder of the quayboard project this should look something like srcroot and and src and quayboard and  replacing the with the relative path from your project to the quayboard project  build your project  b all going well you should get a build succeeded notification this signifies that you re ready to implement quayboard in your project simply add the project to your podfile by adding the line pod quayboard and run pod update in terminal to update the pods you have included in your project you can also specify a version to include such as    pod quayboard     at the top of the header file for the view controller you want to implement quayboard in include quayboard the view controller should also implement jsmquayboardbardelegate in order to receive notification that a key was pressed interface myviewcontroller uiviewcontroller jsmquayboardbardelegate in the viewdidload method create an instance of jsmquayboardbar  set the delegate of the instance as self and set it as the inputaccessoryview of the uitextfield or uitextview you wish to implement on for the purposes of this explanation we re going to use a uitextview jsmquayboardbar quayboardbar jsmquayboardbar alloc initwithframe cgrectmake   viewsize width height quayboardbar delegate self self textview inputaccessoryview quayboardbar you can then implement as many keys as you like they will be evenly distributed across the length of the keyboard quayboardbar addkeywithvalue  quayboardbar addkeywithvalue  quayboardbar addkeywithvalue  quayboardbar addkeywithvalue  quayboardbar addkeywithvalue  quayboardbar addkeywithtitle  andvalue t if you re using a symbol as a title like with the tab key above  you should consider setting an accessibility value on the key so that sight impaired users can easily use your quayboard implementing this is super simple and only takes a few moments touches like this take very little effort but have big returns for some of your potential users jsmquayboardkey tabkey quayboardbar addkeywithtitle  andvalue t tabkey accessibilityvalue tab the final step is to implement the delegate method so that the textview is updated as expected here s an example as shown in the example project for updating a uitextview when a key is pressed void quayboardbar jsmquayboardbar quayboardbar keywaspressed jsmquayboardbutton key and and find the range of the selected text nsrange range self textview selectedrange and and get the relevant strings nsstring firsthalfstring self textview text substringtoindex range location nsstring insertingstring key value nsstring secondhalfstring self textview text substringfromindex range location and range length and and update the textview s text self textview scrollenabled no self textview text nsstring stringwithformat  firsthalfstring insertingstring secondhalfstring self textview scrollenabled yes and and more the selection to after our inserted text range location and insertingstring length range length  self textview selectedrange range now build and run  r you should be presented with the quayboard bar when you select the textview that you implemented it on pressing the keys will update the textview success feels good reward yourself with a crunchie bar or something copyright   daniel farrelly redistribution and use in source and binary forms with or

7581556, an ofun prototype of an ultra modern perl  written in scala it is simplest perhaps to start by saying what this project is not it is not an attempt to create a production version of perl  on the instead this project is an and experiment and to see what a cleaned up and slimmed down perl  might look like the key word here is experiment  because no one knows exactly what that will look like and i want to try and find out i will be running this project in the spirit of the pugs project perl  on haskell  which means it is ofun optimized for fun and i welcome any and all contributors this must be a community effort for it to have any chance of success a sizable portion of the inspiration for this project came from a talk given by jesse vincent called perl   and beyond in which he spoke about a slimmer perl  core which no longer included things like formats unix group and user functions sockets etc he also talked about the idea of breaking some backwards compatibility in a very controlled and clean way and allowing for new features to be added to the core language this talk really struck home because i had discussed exactly this same thing with many people over the years this project is an attempt at doing a lot of what jesse was talking about but instead of trying to clean up the current perl  core i wanted to see what would happen if we started from scratch i believe that perl  is ultimately the true future of perl and that the language that larry is so carefully designing will be a really great and fun language to hack in i got a taste for it when i worked on the pugs project perl  in haskell and i have spent a lot of my time since trying to bring perl  inspired ideas back to perl  moose being the perfect example of this so why am i not directing my efforts towards perl  i believe that it will ultimately benefit perl  to have a more modern perl  that it can interface with this was something that the perl  folks understood as well and was manifested in the ponie project perl  on parrot unfortunately the ponie project did not succeed however the crux of the idea i think is still a good one additionally i plan to work closely with the perl  team to make sure anything we do make here is poised to mesh well with what the perl  team is doing i have started an faq document to help answer questions about this project i suggest you refer there if your questions are not answered in that document please either submit an issue or better yet fork the project add the question seek out an answer and submit a pull request this is a very very very early stage of this project so please do not judge too harshly i have created a status document that will describe in more detail where the project is and also start to lay out things that need to be done as i said above this project will be run pugs style  so i welcome any and all contributions i should warn you though there will likely be a lot of churn and duplicated efforts in the early days as this project gets its footing for to do items refer to the currently the best place to discuss this is in the moe channel on irc perl org github issues are also a perfectly valid means of communication as the project matures this all will evolve more but this should be sufficient for now here is what you need installed to get started java preferably  sbt simple build tool get it from to compile the code and run the test suite you need only type the following at the root of the source tree as is the convention with git based projects please fork and send pull requests it is available for all major operating systems  i think the latest version of eclipse supported by the scala plugin is   so install eclipse   indigo  install egit from the available plugins  from the install new software form add a stable version but the stable only supports up to scala    clone the project using git separately from eclipse into your desired workspace and convert the moe project into an eclipse workspace friendly project  import the project into eclipse file import existing projects into workspace browse to the project sbt should have pulled in scalatest which you can set as your run and debug configurations for running the tests this software is copyright c  infinity interactive inc and licensed under the mit license see the license file for more details

3069882, this small profiler is a library that is supposed to be similar to the stack exchange mvc mini profiler for the asp net mvc framework php isn t always as eloquent as other languages and as such some things don t translate  however this is a good start it will profile any block of code that you want to profile it automatically nests and keeps track of time in the current step level as well as child levels it doesn t automatically attach itself to anything so you can profile as much or as little as you like there are special provisions for profiling sql but that isn t being leveraged currently to do much other than  see how much sql is being executed at any step and  how long it takes glad you asked it s simple method  require profiler php profiler enable profblock profiler start my block sleep  profblock end you can also accomplish the same thing without keeping track of the reference to the current step block like this method  require profiler php profiler enable profiler start my block sleep  profiler end my block the caveat to method  is that your strings must match so it s easy to overlook a small spelling mistake however if the strings don t match you ll get a php warning telling you as such and and we ll assume you have the profiler included and enabled now you only need to require it one time for any project queryprof profiler sqlstart query and and make sure you pass your query that way the profile can analyze it and let you know which queries are being slow db query query queryprof end include the following code in your view template output or whatever it is that you may be using to generate output php profiler render that s it you ll now be able to spot optimizationaly troubled spots of your application the profiler enable call is intended to be called conditionally you are absolutely not going to want to have the profiler running full time in your production environment that d clearly be an overly high waste of resources only enable profiling when you actually need to see how things are going pro tip enable profiling conditionally based on your requesting ip address or some other authentication system this way profiling will always be turned on for you and never for your visitors the profiler render method automatically ends every block in the stack so it can accurately output the time it spent in each block as best it can basically if you wanted to profile your view you d have no way to see how much time it took to render the view if the view profile block was ended after output was generated the profiler render method accepts a maxdepth parameter which allows you to tell the renderer not to render any steps beyond the maximum depth passed default is  which means give it all to me you can skip ending child blocks by just ending a parent block you can do this by calling profiler end with the name of the parent block you want to end this will close every child block regardless of name until it reaches the parent this does produce warnings be careful you can go all the way to the root level by accidentally referencing a parent node incorrectly put bugs into issues and feel free to fork and submit pull requests for any new features and bug fixes and etc copyright c  jim rubenstein jrubenstein gmail com permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files the software  to deal in the software without restriction including without limitation the rights to use copy modify merge publish distribute sublicense and and or sell copies of the software and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so subject to the following conditions the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software the software is provided as is  without warranty of any kind express or implied including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement in no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim damages or other liability whether in an action of contract tort or otherwise arising from out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software

758689, this gem will not be maintained anymore there is an official gem being developed and we encourage you to use that gem from now on we will merge pr for bugs for a little period of time but no new features will be added upgrade to version    to avoid xss vulnerability mixpanel is a real time analytics service that helps companies understand how users interact with web applications track events with properties directly from your backend track events with properties through javascript using a rack middleware set and increment user attributes directly from your backend set and increment user attributes through javascript using a rack middleware gem install mixpanel only needed if you want to track events via javascript this setup will allow your backend to have the client browser process the actual requests over javascript rather than sending the request yourself if you are using rails you can add this to your specific environment configuration file located in config and environments and or create a new initializer for it config middleware use mixpanel middleware  yourmixpanelapitoken  options where options is a hash that accepts the following keys insertmixpanelscripts boolean default true by default the mixpanel javascript api library scripts are inserted into the html if you d prefer to insert them yourself set the insertmixpanelscripts flag to false insertjslast boolean default false by default the scripts are inserted into the head of the html response if you d prefer the scripts to run after all rendering has completed set the insertjslast flag to true and they ll be added at the end of the body tag this will work whether or not you opt for the aynchronous version of the api however this will have no effect when inserting js into an ajax response persist boolean default false if you would like the mixpanel gem may be configured to store its queue in a rack session this allows events to be stored through redirects which can be helpful if you sign in and redirect but want to associate an event with that action the mixpanel gem will also remove duplicate events from your queue for information that should only be transmitted to the api once such as mixpanel identify  mixpanel nametag  mixpanel people set  and mixpanel register this allows you to use a beforefilter to set these variables redirect and still have them only transmitted to enable persistence  you must set the flag twice here when instantiating middleware and again when you initialize the mixpanel class config hash default mixpanel mixpanel tracker new yourmixpanelapitoken options where options is a hash that accepts the following keys async boolean default false built in async feature events are sent to a subprocess via a pipe and the sub process asynchronously send events to mixpanel this value can be overwritten on subsequent method calls i e  this setting represents the default for your mixpanel object but each call can overwrite this default setting this process uses a single thread to upload events and may start dropping events if your application generates them at a very high rate while this is a simple way to have asynchronous interaction with mixpanel more robust solutions are available specifically see the resque example how to track events using resque and rails below persist boolean default false this is used in connection with the rack middleware section rack middleware above if you are not going to use middleware to send requests to mixpanel through javascript you don t need to worry about this option if you would like the mixpanel gem may be configured to store its queue in a rack session this allows events to be stored through redirects which can be helpful if you sign in and redirect but want to associate an event with that action the mixpanel gem will also remove duplicate events from your queue for information that should only be transmitted to the api once such as mixpanel identify  mixpanel nametag  mixpanel people set  and mixpanel register this allows you to use a beforefilter to set these variables redirect and still have them only transmitted to enable persistence  you must set the flag twice when instantiating middleware and here when you initialize the mixpanel class apikey string default nil when using the import functionality import events  you must set an api key to go along with your token if not set when the class is instantiated you will be required to send the api key in the options hash of the import method env hash default this is used by the gem to append information from your request environment to your mixpanel request if you are calling this directly from a controller simply passing in request env will be sufficient however as explained in the resque example your environment might choke if it tries to convert that hash to json not to mention how large that hash can be you can just pass in a subset of the full environment ruby env remoteaddr request env remoteaddr  httpxforwardedfor request env httpxforwardedfor  rack session request env rack session  mixpanelevents request env mixpanelevents mixpanel mixpanel tracker new mixpaneltoken env env basically this information is being used to set the default ip address associated with the request and grab any session variables needed to run the middleware stuff additional information contained in your environment e g  httpreferer can simply be sent in as attributes where appropriate for your use case mixpanel track eventname properties options eventname is a string denoting how you want this event to appear in your mixpanel dashboard properties is a hash of properties to be associated with the event the keys in the properties can either be strings it will automatically be converted to the correct form e g  os mac will be converted to os mac options is a hash that accepts the following keys async boolean default the async value from when the class was instantiated apikey string default the apikey value from when the class was instantiated url string this can be used to proxy mixpanel api requests test boolean default false send data to a high priority rate limited queue to make testing easier mixpanel track purchased credits  number  first time buyer true if you would like to alias one distinct id to another you can use the alias helper method mixpanel alias siddhartha  distinctid previousdistinctid mixpanel trackingpixel opened email  distinctid bob email com  campaign retarget this allows to track events just by loading a pixel it s usually useful for tracking opened emails you ve got to specify your own distinctid as it won t be able to retrieve it from cookies and you can use it in your views with an imagetag helper imagetag mixpanel trackingpixel opened email  distinctid bob email com  campaign retarget  width  height  this allows to track events just when a user clicks a link it s usually useful for tracking opened emails mixpanel import eventname properties options all of these options have the same meaning and same defaults as the track method track events directly  except that the mixpanel import purchased credits

107630,  and oo and mm a and m a g p i e avhh av av av magpie is a small dynamically typed programming language built around patterns classes and multimethods it has a prototype interpreter that runs on the jvm and an in progress bytecode vm written in c and and it looks a bit like this and and generates the sequence of turns needed to draw a dragon curve def dragon    def dragon n is num turn dragon n  r and turn and dragon n  l print dragon  its goal is to let you write code that s beautiful and easy to read and to allow you to seamlessly extend the language and libraries as you see fit magpie has two implementations right now there is a prototype interpreter written in java this supports more of the language but is of course tied to the jvm and is much slower it s main job was to let me iterate on the language semantics quickly now that the language has mostly settled down i ve started writing a bytecode vm in c and and this is the real magpie implementation but it s still a work in progress all current development is going on here the java interpreter is mainly a reference  generate a project from the root directory of the magpie repo and rungyp  set the output directory xcode  only recent versions of xcode build into some shared directory not related to where the project is this borks magpie since it s a command line executable that loads the core library from a path relative to that executable unfortunately this setting isn t in the project itself so gyp can t help after you generate the project open it in xcode then  choose file project settings  on the build tab click advanced  set build location to custom relative to workspace  set products to build  set intermediates to build and intermediates  click done this should ensure that magpie gets built into build and config and magpie  build the project do what you usually do on your os to build the thing on mac that means open the xcode project and build from there in windows there is a visual studio solution you can build on linux you can just run make  build it the repo includes an eclipse project if that s your thing if you rock the command line you can just do cd magpie ant jar magpie is a command line app after building it you can run it by doing and magpie this will run the java interpreter or the bytecode vm whichever is more recent if you run it with no arguments it drops you into a simple repl enter a magpie expression and it will immediately evaluate it since everything is an expression even things like class definitions you can build entire programs incrementally this way here s one to get you started for i in   do print your name is awesome if you pass an argument to the app it will assume it s a path to a script file and it will load and execute it and magpie example and hello mag
11863138, yesterday i set out on a treck to start writing my first chromecast app what i found was a woefully incomplete amount developers had worked on while the task was not insurmountable because of this i thought why not just write up a simple hello world with commentary to make any would be chromecast dev s life easier so that s what this is a barebones sender and receiver to help you understand how this all fits together for now i only have a chrome sender soon i ll probably work on the equivalent for android but let s get started i m not going to go into too much detail with this because google did a pretty good job of outlining this process you to hear a response one thing to mention is that to start chromecast development you re going to need to host your receiver app somewhere github has free pages hosting but in the long run that would be a little limited so look into your options and make the decision that works best for you right now an important note the url you give google has to be the exact location of your receiver app s index html if you would supply that url the way the process works now does not have any support for subdirectories so you have to make sure you re specific also if you rename the receiver app from index html to anything else you ll have to also while you re waiting for this you might as well follow the second set of steps on that page and whitelist localhost in the chromecast extension now the fun part these apps aren t particularly difficult once you get the hang of it so don t sweat it if you were a little confused from google s documentation right now it s not very good to start off with we re going to go ahead and create our receiver app assumption that you understand it as well as basic html css and javascript if not you may want to start researching and learning those first having that base knowledge is important for being able to create useful chromecast apps so one thing to remember is that all receiver applications are written in html and css and javascript for some this might seem awesome and for others it might seem limited just remember what chromecast is supposed to be a media digester you can still do a lot within these confines though so don t get discouraged if you have big ideas since our receiver is so tiny i m just going to go ahead and show you the whole source and then make comments html head and head body h waiting for messages and h and div and body script function var receiver new cast receiver receiver your app id  your namespace  channelhandler new cast receiver channelhandler your namespace  messages messages channelhandler addchannelfactory receiver createchannelfactory your namespace  receiver start  channelhandler addeventlistener cast receiver channel eventtype message onmessage bind this  function onmessage event messages html event message type   and script and html not so bad right let s break it down the html chunk should be pretty familiar to you html head and head body h waiting for messages and h and div and body this just sets up where we re going to actually be displaying our content i did some simple css too you can look at the finished code on github if you re intersted next comes the scripts the first just gets us jquery the second is what actually gets us access to the receiver api so make sure you don t leave it out otherwise your app isn t going to work at all and then we have our script right away you start to see some garbage that mentions cast as you might have guessed this is our first receiver api call var receiver new cast receiver receiver your app id  your namespace  this creates a new receiver object this is what we ll be using to facilitate ways of communicating with the client and device oh and remember when we whitelisted our device the e mail you got should have contained your application id that needs to replace your app id as for your namespace it can be anything you want but should probably be related to the application you re creating for this tutorial we can use something like helloworld make sure it doesn t clash with other namespaces though as this is how your receiver will know what type of messages to listen to and how your sender will know what type of messages to send more on that later or right now channelhandler new cast receiver channelhandler your namespace  this little guy as you might have guessed is what handles our channels a channel in this context is used to send and receive simple json messages to and from the sender application the channelhandler allows us to hook into the events that occur on the various channels that get created as the application is being used it also delegates to a channelfactory which you ll see a little later to create new channels again note the namespace make sure you use the same one that you defined earlier on in the receiver this tells our channelhandler to only worry about messages coming from that namespace the next line is just there to keep track of our messages div so we can swap out the text later following that we create our channelfactory channelhandler addchannelfactory receiver createchannelfactory your namespace that namespace again just fill it in like before here we re adding to our channelhandler a channelfactory like i said eariler this is how channels actually get created we use the receiver to create the channelfactory great we ve got our receiver and our channelhandler all set up does it work yet just a little bit more first we need to tell the receiver to start listening to the world receiver start then we make sure our channelhandler is listening for messsageevents channelhandler addeventlistener cast receiver channel eventtype message onmessage bind this the second parameter as you should know from your javascript training just delegates the onmessage function as our callback when we hear a messageevent and binds this as our context channels do have other types of events we can also listen for when the channel is opened closed or when it has an error for this tutorial we ll just stick with messages though last we actually do something with the messageevent function onmessage event messages html event message type these messageevents have several parameters but the thing that actually gets sent from the sender application is the message object which is generally going to be represented as json you ll see in the next section that we basically define that json to look however we want so there you go your first receiver app now let s make a sender to do something with it before we get started writing the sender app it d be good to mention that you ll probably want some way of running a web server on your local machine without it you can t really test this for pretty much any platform into any directory you want to host and launch it you ll be able to access the folder from localhost  now let s whip up a sender so our receiver can actually do something this one is a little longer so i won t paste in the whole source see my github page for that first we have our html portion html data cast api enabled true head title hello world chrome sender and title and head body h choose a receiver and h ul class receiver list li looking for receivers and li and ul and div button class kill disabled kill the connection and button and body something you might notice is that we aren t importing any scripts for the sender api that s because this is handled by two things you should remember way back when we were whitelisting our receiver that we also whitelisted localhost in the chromecast extension for chrome this basically tells the extension that on the localhost domain we are allowing the extension to inject the sender api into any page however it won t just inject it all willy nilly our sender pages require this line html data cast api enabled true to tell the extension that we want the api injected on this page make sure you don t forget it everything else in the html section should be pretty clear we have a container which will list out all the receivers that i snuck that one in there if you don t know about underscore you should check it out it s a really great little functional library for javascript i only use it for one thing here and i ll describe what s happening when we get there i ve also done a little styling for this page which you can look at on the github moving right along we ll jump into our script we declare our variables and then add some odd looking listener to our window object var castapi cvactivity receiverlist killswitch kill window addeventlistener message  function event if event source window event data event data source castapi event data event hello initializeapi   the event listener isn t too crazy one of the consequences of the way the sender api gets injected into our pages is that we don t really have any control over when it happens but the google devs were smart and gave us a way of finding out exactly when we can start interacting with it after the sender api is loaded it emits a messageevent to tell us so so we listen for this event the if block checks to make sure the contents of the messageevent match what we re looking for as per google s docs this event looks like this source castapi  event hello  apiversion x y the version number basically lets our sender decide if it s compatible with this version of the api besides that we just make sure that the data in the messageevent matches the source and event described then we initialize our api initializeapi function if castapi castapi new cast api castapi addreceiverlistener your app id  onreceiverlist  i ve added a check in here which makes sure we aren t calling this if we all ready have an api so we create a new castapi object and attach a receiverlistener to it this will simply tell the castapi that there are receivers which are listening for our what s that oh our app id bet you were wondering when that d show up in case you hadn t figured it out by now the way this whole app id business works is google registers your device to listen for your app id when you whitelist it that app id is tied to a particular website the one you supplied when you whitelisted your device this is how the receiver knows which url to hit when it gets a launch request but now we re getting ahead of ourselves the second parameter to addreceiverlistener is what callback to use when we get a list of valid receivers which brings onreceiverlist function list if list length  receiverlist list receiver list empty receiverlist foreach function receiver listitem on click  receiverclicked receiver list append listitem   according to google s documentation the receiverlistener fires at least once regardless of if it s found anything once you register it so we start with a check to make sure we actually have receivers then we just take that list and dump it out in our receiver list element we store the id of the receiver in a data attribute on the anchor tag so we can reference it later then we attach click handlers to the list items receiverclicked function e e preventdefault var target e target  receiver  find receiverlist function receiver return receiver id target data id  dolaunch receiver this isn t too out there all standard javascript and jquery this is where i end up using underscore  find receiverlist it should be pretty easy to figure out what s going on there underscore has a find function that takes two parameters the list you want to try to find something in and a function to execute on each item in the list find works by looping through the list until the supplied function returns true in our case this is when we have found the receiver whose id matches that of the link we clicked simple enough after we ve found the right receiver we launch our application dolaunch function receiver if cvactivity var request new cast launchrequest your app id  receiver  killswitch prop disabled  false  castapi launch request onlaunch  first we check to make sure we don t already have an activity launched on the receiver while nothing bad would happen if we tried to launch another activity before closing out the first i figured i d put that check in there as long as that passes we use the cast api and create a launchrequest there s that app id again like i said before this is how your receiver knows which url to launch we also pass in which receiver the launchrequest should go to we then enable our kill switch and finally send our launchrequest to the receiver the second parameter of the launch function is the callback function for when the launch is succesful at this point if you just added an empty onlaunch function had your receiver hosted and were running a server on your local machine you d be able to open up this page in your browser click on the link to your receiver and your app should launch exciting right we ll just add a couple more things to show off some other interactions with the receiver first that onlaunch function onlaunch function activity if activity status running cvactivity activity  castapi sendmessage cvactivity activityid your namespace  type helloworld  once our application gets launched on the receiver why don t we say something to it first we check the activitystatus that we got back from the launch function from before is in the running state you can think of the activitystatus as representing what our connection to the receiver is doing it also contains the id of the activity  which we use to communicate with the recevier as you can see in the next line here we use the cast api to send a message to our receiver this function is one of two types of interactions you can have with your receiver and as far as i can tell it isn t even documented the other deals with mediarequests  but that s getting out of scope of this tutorial the first parameter to the sendmessage  again is that activity id the second parameter is your namespace if you think way back to the receiver section of the tutorial you ll remember that this is how the receiver knows which messages to actually listen to if you defined your namespace as helloworld use that here otherwise just use whatever you had before last we actually have the object which represents our message you can literally put whatever you want in here it s just a freeform json object for now we ll just include a type attribute and say this is a helloworld type message so now if you reloaded your sender application and clicked on your receiver link you should see the placeholder text waiting for messages change to helloworld on your tv hey look at that we made our tv do something just one more thing to do and then the tutorial is over hooray let s add a click handler that will actually end our session with the receiver killswitch on click  function castapi stopactivity cvactivity activityid function cvactivity null killswitch prop disabled  true  this one is pretty straight forward when we click on the kill switch we call stopactivity on the cast api this does exactly what it sounds like we pass it the activity id from our active activity and it tells the receiver we re done the second parameter is just a callback function for when the receiver tells us it successfully closed the app when that s done we null out our activity so we can start a new one if we want and disable the kill switch that s it if you reload your sender you should now be able to  launch your activity on your receiver  observe the text on your tv changing  close out the application  rinse and repeat look at that your first end to end chromecast app go forth and be merry and show all your friends that you can control your tv with a web browser but maybe do something a little more interesting with the app first the sky is the limit now i hope this has been useful for you but this is only the tip of the iceberg well maybe not iceberg this device certainly doesn t do everything but it isn t supposed to really the depth from this device is going to be in the interesting html apps people make that work with this thing the interaction with the device itself as you can see is pretty simple it s just figuring out how to use the interaction model to make cool useful apps however this tutorial does not cover the other half of development on the chromecast media there is a whole section of the api for the sender and receiver which covers media interaction from playing and pausing to volume control the same principles we ve talked about here apply but the functions and objects you use are a little different in some places perhaps in a future tutorial i ll cover that stuff for now you should be able to muddle through the documentation google has provided thanks for reading

5845542, android ssl bypass  this is an android debugging tool that can be used for bypassing ssl even when certificate pinning is implemented as well as other debugging tasks the tool runs as an interactive console the architecture of the tool is plugin based in order to be able to load debugging code at runtime plugins can currently be written in java or jython these debugger plugins can create breakpoint events and register themselves as handlers for those breakpoints currently the last plugin registering an event wins as the handler for that event the sslbypassjdiplugin found in the plugins directory implements bypassing ssl for certain implementations of ssl and certificate pinning the process for bypassing ssl checks is simply to set breakpoints on certain functions and replace the allowallhostnameverifier the hope is that the tool can be used as a starting point for further development it is very much a work in progress and will be frequently updated in the near future requirements  android api  and android sdk platform tools a debuggable app to test app with debuggable flag in application manifest any app on emulator any app on device with ro debuggable  or ro

ssltestapp twistedsslserver py  this is the debugger plugin that implements bypassing ssl checks this will only work for apps which implement certificate pinning or ssl in a particular way it is left as an exercise for the user to implement a better plugin which will bypass all methods of doing ssl in android this plugin depends on loading source from an external location into the app process space therefore this plugin requires that a helper app also be installed androidsslbypasshelperapp this plugin can be tested with the corresponding test app ssltestapp known issues  the way that the ssl bypass plugin works is to load code from a location external to the app via reflection and reflection causes a strange issue that has not yet been resolved the debugger will throw and exception when an object created from such a reflected class is being set as the value of a local variable the basic mantra for this tool if it does not work the first time try stopping the debugger and running again without closing the app  modify the properties in build properties corresponding to locations of ddmlib ddmlib is found in the android sdk at android sdk tools lib ddmlib jar ensure that tools

hardcoded for now a better test app will be included in the future follow the basic usage instructions for running sslbypassjdiplugin custom jython plugin overview  this tool is rather poorly named android ssl bypass in that bypassing ssl is far from all it does it was initally presented at conference where bypassing ssl was its main purpose however it was created to be an extensible debugging tool that can be used for a variety of debugging tasks it might be more aptly named something like android debug shell  and probably will be changed to that at some point this aims to provide a basic guide for creating your own simple debugging plugins for the tool using jython the plugins can be written in java as well but jython is the easiest method for extensibility the power of jython is that it lets us easily use and java classes in the classpath so we can import the java class abstractjdiplugin and create a python class which extends it in order to create a plugin that can be loaded by the tool in the future when the apis are more solid there will be real documentation but for now there is only source code some jargon interface which represents an event request to the virtual machine an event can be one of the following accesswatchpointevent breakpointevent classprepareevent classunloadevent exceptionevent locatableevent methodentryevent methodexitevent

3954203, si mply rea ctive declarative orchestration in haskell using the reactive demand programming rdp model an rdp application is a complex symphony of signals and declarative effects orchestrated in space and time rdp is stateless logic on a stateful grid everybody knows side effects aren t compositional but that statement is only true in general there are useful subsets of side effects that have nice properties e g idempotence commutativity monotonicity for a small subset of effects one can achieve equational reasoning and refactoring on par with the very best pure law abiding programming models i call these declarative effects any pure functional programming advocate also knows effects are rarely essential i e that sufficient cleverness will find a wonderfully pure solution most problems how much more could be achieved with just a little cleverness and a few highly constrained declarative effects reactive demand programming was developed as an answer to that question in rdp the only effect is observing of the active set of demands by a resource those demands are typically queries or control signals rdp s effect model was inspired from a symmetric observer effect in physics and psychology one cannot observe a system without influencing its behavior since observation implies influence it is possible to observe for the sole purpose of influence thus only one concept is needed for query and control demands are represented as long lived signals signal processing is local modular and composable treating the signals as a set is essential for rdp s spatial idempotence and commutativity the answer anything worth doing can be done with declarative effects or rather anything worth being can become with declarative effects this includes state video music sensor networks control systems user interface all can be adequately observed and influenced via the rdp paradigm it does take new idioms and abstractions especially new state models to effectively adapt and utilize external resources what is reactive demand programming  most programmers even those who rarely venture beyond imperative abstractions are familiar with at least one declarative dataflow concept the spreadsheet rdp might be framed as a natural way to extend spreadsheets with functions and effects every cell is described by a function access to a cell always requires a parameter cells carrying simple values are represented as functions that ignore their parameters a cell s function may be evaluated continuously and concurrently with many parameters some special cells represent externals such as mouse keyboard database display special cells can observe the full concurrent set of parameters to influence values functions may be used as parameters or results cell names can be used as functions the spreadsheet analogy does suggest the question how does one display a cell whose value is a function however i mean to emphasize the reactive and dataflow aspect of spreadsheets rdp like a spreadsheet enables dataflow but rdp is a bidirectional dataflow model in addition to receiving values every downstream client is also pushing values upstream parameters those values are used in many ways as database queries as control signals to publish data or to register services the bidirectional flow makes rdp far more expressive modular extensible and composable than traditional spreadsheets the cost of supporting bidirectional dataflow and effects on externals is rdp must abandon the illusion of instantaneous dataflow dataflow takes time especially when it involves a requests on external resources time is essential to dampen and understand any feedback properties rdp uses explicit logical latency to support safe consistent propagation and processing of values it can take time for a change upstream to affect a downstream client or for a change in a client to affect an upstream service but it will be a very predictable amount of time an rdp based spreadsheet would be a wonderful application of rdp for teaching rdp for live programming and as a potential killer application in its own right however it must wait until sirea is further along rdp does not use a spreadsheet nomenclature but there are names for corresponding elements in rdp time varying parameters and responses are formally modeled as signals the effectful functions of rdp are called behaviors the special cells are said to access resources using its bidirectional dataflows and dynamic behaviors rdp can represent multi agent systems ad hoc workflows oo patterns frameworks overlay networks in combination with external state resources rdp is a complete paradigm for general purpose programming it may help to read some of rdp s background and motivations sirea status  sirea is now in an alpha state all the primitive behaviors everything in sirea behavior have been implemented plus partitions and a few trivial resources clock printing to console demand monitors are coming soon several packages are planned for sirea this toplevel directory is sirea core sirea core  primitive behaviors demand monitor resources utilities startup and shutdown sirea filesys

plan to divide apis into parts one part for plugin header a typable data type and another part for the plugin implementations for now i expect to keep most of these together in one git project reactive demand programming offers many wonderful high level features that make sirea a pleasure to use rdp also offers interesting state models that would not have been envisioned for imperative systems these are discussed in later sections here i ll aim for a short list of sirea specific features type driven resource locators  users of sirea have almost zero overhead for connecting to arbitrary resources and using them resources and threads are named by types data typeable and typeof are leveraged for initialization sharing and resource management any io boiler plate is easily shifted to a few typeclasses in adapter libraries the plugins module will take this feature further replacing haskell s name based import system with a type driven import model orthogonal persistence  reactive demand programming necessarily models state as an external resource sirea takes full advantage of this by making all state resources persistent excepting those that are semantically volatile such as short windowed history live programming  live programming has been done in many languages including haskell however it has generally been ad hoc requiring a highly constrained programming style reactive demand programming offers a sound foundation for live programming including dependency management and state sirea will support live programming through a blank slate application combined with runtime compilation and reloading of plugins you will be able to start your sirea and haskell application before writing it this has potential beyond rdp to become a primary way to develop haskell applications multi agent systems  if an rdp behavior is specified primarily for its effects it is easy to consider it an agent for a multi agent system sirea favors this idea for the higher level application behaviors the initial sireaapp is an agent the module sirea agentresource allows unique agents to be modeled as resources via a typeclass the live programming model will be agent based allowing multiple plugins to each contribute resources performance  sirea is designed to perform competitively and predictably this includes solutions for update ordering problems batching of updates between threads minimal use of caches speculative evaluation and resource acquisition bounded buffers to control memory and ensure fairness a few simple optimizations and behaviors for data parallelism sirea is suitable for soft real time applications batteries included  sirea is intended to be a complete application framework a valid option for industry work convenience functions documentation and utility behaviors are included planned packages will cover many common resources user input graphics filesystem web services ultimately sirea should be a serious mature application framework the first of its kind for truly declarative programming the weaknesses of sirea rdp belong more to sirea than to rdp developers must use a point free style for rdp behaviors in sirea this a very rewarding style once you become familiar with it and the full power of haskell functions is still available via bfmap beval but newcomers often find point free intimidating sirea is sensitive to the os clock sirea and rdp can tolerate a few milliseconds drift but ideally need robust monotonic well synchronized clocks it is best to use sirea in conjunction with a time services for the os sirea attempts to recognize and logically deactivate for the duration of a suspended state e g when the laptop sleeps  but the current implementation seems to have a high heap overhead when recovering i m working on this one performance of dynamic behaviors is poor i e expensive install and maintain difficult to optimize and anticipate rdp is designed with an assumption of having very few relatively stable layers of dynamic behavior e g for staged metaprogramming sirea can handle that much more will probably take a dedicated rdp language or edsl that can perform partial evaluations tracing or other cross layer optimizations reactive demand programming in sirea  the reactive demand programming rdp view divides the world into three kinds of things resources  behaviors  and signals resources might broadly be classed into sensors actuators state and services specific examples include keyboard mouse joystick webcam microphone monitor speaker filesystem databases network printers by nature resources are external to rdp but may be accessed by rdp behaviors resources cannot be created in rdp there is no equivalent to oop new however resources may be dynamically discovered at runtime and clever manipulations of stateful resources such as a filesystem can model creation in terms of discovery e g by computing a unique filename behaviors describe computation rich data plumbing between resources some behaviors will represent access to a resource providing a capability to observe or influence it but the majority of behaviors in an rdp application are often simple data plumbing and pure transforms cf sirea behavior rdp behaviors cannot accumulate state all state is kept in external resources a simple linear behavior might gain a joystick signal from glfw transform that signal into controls for a robotic arm bcross over to a partition representing the robot resource then push the signal to the robotic arm getjoydata bfmap joytorobotarmctrl bcross controlarm rdp can express many independently concurrent behaviors e g using and and behaviors can be dynamic i e there is a behavior to evaluate behaviors beval signals describe values as they change over time those values typically represent states e g the position of a mouse frames from a webcam content for a video display future states are not entirely predictable so signals must be updated over time propagating those updates and transforming the signals are the primary roles of behaviors it is not possible to observe a signal s history and consequently signals are constrained by durations of explicit active observation for example a signal describing the position of a joystick is only active while a behavior is actively observing it behaviors cannot create or destroy signals but can manipulate existing signals in flexible ways rdp programming directly concerns only the behaviors an rdp application is a behavior analogous to io or void main  with trivial inputs and outputs and activated entirely for declarative effects signals and resources are not programmable abstractions within rdp they are not first class however signals and resources are useful concepts for motivating understanding and explaining behaviors also many sirea users especially early adopters will develop adapters to resources and services developing these adapters requires a very concrete understanding of the signal and resource models signals and resources are concretely relevant for developing resource adapters and ffi resources and signals are useful concepts for motivating and understanding the behaviors but are not programming abstractions signals and resources are concretely relevant if developing an adapter between sirea and an ad hoc resource such as a joystick an rdp application in sirea is a behavior that is installed between resources and bootstrapped by the sirea runtime e g via runsireaapp a few short examples of resources behaviors and signals a mouse is a resource a mouse might be accessed by a behavior called glfwmousepos the glfwmousepos behavior will respond to a unit typed input signal representing a long lived query in particular the duration and time of the query with an output signal representing the mouse s position updated over the lifetime of the query the output signal can be transformed and transported by more behaviors to do something useful such as influence state that affects a display an sql database is a resource an sql database might be accessed by a behavior called querydb the input signal might contain a select from foo where bar  query string the output signal would contain the query result a list of entries from foo alternatively the result might contain some error information saying that there is no foo  or that the connection could not be established it is possible for both the query string and the output signal to change over time e g to update the demand to bar   or to receive update indicating changes due a db update in general these changes are independent i e it is possible that two different query strings result in the same data and it is possible that some database changes are irrelevant to the query result when rdp programmers need a signal with the constant value  they will use bconst  there is a concept of the  signal salways   which is was and forever will be  but rdp cannot create the  signal rdp can only transform some existing signal into a  maintaining the start and stop time and partition of the existing signal this protects duration coupling there are many other operations on pure signals that are illegal for direct use in rdp fold mask etc  which is why rdp developers do not have direct access to signals the best way to learn rdp is probably to use it and to implement examples a few lines at a time i ll make an effort to provide many example as i make progress in implementing the rdp utilities the following sections discuss signals behaviors and resources more deeply signal values  note rdp developers do not use first class signals rdp developers do not use second class signals rdp developers do not directly observe or manipulate signals however an understanding of signals is essential for understanding rdp concrete knowledge of signals and their representation is also necessary to adapt sirea to external resources adapters to other paradigms are almost never purely rdp code a signal is a value a signal describes another value as it changes over time often the the time varying value will represent state of an external resource for example if i were to continuously observe the state of the w key on my keyboard it would be in an up state most of the time and in a down state for the brief times i press the button as when writing down  when  or writing i could represent this in a signal by mapping the position of the w key on a precise timeline    up w not pressed tt tt down w pressed one might represent this discrete varying signal in a data structure as follows signal up t down  t up  t down  t up and known updates value for all history note that the states can be stored as a sequence of discrete updates but full signal still represents a time varying value that is the signal is up until t  then down until t  then up until t  etc the meaning of this representation is important for example the meaning suggests that the time values had better be in some strictly increasing monotonic order for rdp the above signal is incomplete signals have a lifespan also called activity cycle a definite start time and indefinite end time this lifespan is not a property of the keyboard but rather a property of the observer of the keyboard an observer must start observing at some definite time in sirea lifespan is represented by wrapping every signal value in a maybe type and use the nothing value to indicate durations where no observation occurs    just up w not pressed t tt tt t just down w pressed nnnn nnnn nothing signal nothing t just up  t just down  t just up  t just down  t just up  t nothing the use of maybe allows sequential signals to be combined on a single update stream and supports efficient implementation of the asynchronous sum type x and y see below note the nothing value used here does not represent failure failure must always be represented by an active signal e g if i want to represent the possibility that the keyboard is inaccessible then i d need to use a type like either keystate error for the active signal this is necessary for rdp s duration coupling invariant and is preferable because it allows rdp behaviors to observe failure and take appropriate action sirea has gone through a few implementations of signals the current representation is essentially the same as the list described above but slightly more compact and with an assumption that the list is of finite length or even spine strict such that we can safely filter false updates some operations will search for the end of the list sirea cannot directly represent infinite signals unless they are constant this only impacts a few trivial behaviors that are time varying but utterly predictable such as logical clocks advantages of this constraint are that it is easy to reason about memory and performance in a loop and it generalizes well to networked systems there is also no risk of divergence when eliminating false updates signals have an abstract api the representation is rarely accessed directly signal updates are not observable within an rdp expression but are accessible when developing resource adapters and ffi bindings for sirea conceptually a newly constructed rdp behavior graph has all signals initially set to an inactive state subsequent updates will activate resources and control the state of the rdp system updates are performed through lnkup structures which are provided in the process of compiling and constructing the behavior data lnkup a lnkup lntouch io  lnupdate stablet t sig a io  lnidle stablet io  the update method indicates that we re to switch to the provided signal at the given time the roles of stability touch and idle are described in a later section about implementing rdp behaviors in a general sense rdp updates could be more expressive than switching the full future of a signal e g if a signal value is a set it would be convenient to add or remove specific values from the set but in interest of keeping it simple sirea only supports whole future updates specialized behavior constructors for operating on patches might be a feasible option down the road signal updates have several nice properties in addition to those of general message passing updates to a full signal are idempotent useful for resilience on a shoddy network connection sequential updates are composable by piggybacking useful when fast source feeds slow consumer updates allow takebacks limited by stability optimistic concurrency eventual consistency updates can target future masks variability in latency simplifies scheduling avoids rework resource control and gc can be built into signals by controlling activity and stability these are in addition to the many benefits associated with anticipation and speculative evaluation in sirea a behavior is compiled into a network with all signals inactive the first signal update will activate the behavior see more on implementing rdp behaviors in a later section there are many problem domains where support for continuous varying signals would be useful motion sound animation charting physics probability sirea currently supports only discrete varying signals which is quite suitable for digital information boolean values integers text however rdp in general can support piecewise continuous signals i am interested in eventually developing support for continuous signals most likely in a transformative layer above sirea rdp this has at least two special requirements upon bdelay need to time shift the signal contents instead of bsplit need some support for zero crossings signals in space and time  concrete signals are effective for tightly coupled values that are processed and updated together but more structure is necessary for flexibility efficiency and scalability sirea uses three structural notations for complex signals  s p a represents a concrete signal sig a located spatially at partition p unless subjected to dead code elimination this results in a signal value being represented at partition p use of the p type prevents implicit communication of signals between partitions developers must use bcross or similar to cross partitions which simplifies sirea s communication model and improves its efficiency  x y describes an asynchronous product of signals both elements x and y  are active at roughly the same time depending on differences in delay both have the same active durations by modeling a product in different partitions i e s p a s p b  an asynchronous product can model a distributed computation  x and y describes an asynchronous sum of signals like a switching network in general the x and y are active at different times but differences in latency on the different branches can cause brief overlap for transition from the faster to the slower the active duration is split between x and y the asynchronous property is a consequence of constructs like bleft bdelay   or bfirst bdelay    resulting in component signals having different latencies these are logical delays achieved by increasing the sustate and sustability times and thus have no significant performance consequence modeling of delays is important semantically both to dampen feedback loops and to allow signals time to propagate through a complex behavior this is a different notion of asynchrony than is common to multi threading promises actors rdp can model the latter form of asynchrony by use of shared state communication e g blackboard models task queues but latencies for asynchronous products and signals are statically known making them suitable for real time systems use of bsynch will logically synchronize complex signals by logically delaying the lower latency concrete signals this results in signals being logically aligned since this is static it works even if they are distributed across multiple partitions logical synchronization is very efficient and can be more precise than state based synchronization whether logically synchronous operations will be physically synchronized depends on the ability to synchronize clocks or at least estimate clock offsets there are two special signals which were developed to better fit various theoretic models s a signal that is useless because it does not exist s a signal that is useless because is stuck in an abstract partition while rdp developers cannot destroy signals they can dump them someplace irretrievable s similarly while rdp developers cannot create signals they can invent unused signal types in a choice s most sirea users will stick to binl or bfst rather than mess with these types behaviors  behaviors describe computation rich dataflow networks that manipulate signals a behavior will be compiled and installed establishing a concrete instance of the behavior a concrete dataflow network installing a behavior has no effect other than to prepare a few unique names and caches the initial signal is inactive once installed a behavior is activated by signal update some behaviors provide access to effectful resources such as sensors actuators or shared state for concrete instances of those behaviors updates to the input signal are often independent of updates to the output signal e g one does not need to update a query signal for a mouse or keyboard or video camera to receive many updates to a signal representing observed values conversely a stateful resource or an ok and error signal from an actuator might be very stable despite many changes to inputs effects on resources are declarative based on the set of active signals at any given time different resources tend to update at different times and frequencies use of the complex signal types x y and x and y enable developers to describe subnets that update at different rates this is critical for efficiency developers can easily control and reason about which behavior subnets might be updated based on changes upstream by arranging for some signals to be more stable e g by utilizing an intermediate state resource developers can protect subsystems that cannot handle rapid or short term variations in input a sirea rdp application is a behavior whose activation is bootstrapped by runsireaapp the behavior has trivial signal types and thus is activated only for its declarative effects otherwise there is nothing special about the application behavior developers can easily pretend the application behavior is dynamically activated by an even larger behavior or may even compose it into a larger behavior rdp is metacircular it s behaviors all the way down behaviors are composed as dataflows across an open system abstractly those dataflows are signals for the concrete installed behavior those dataflows are signal updates the simplest dataflow is linear and is appropriately called a pipeline the constructor for pipelines is this operator is from control category  where flip composition with is associative chainable and models dataflow from left to right this results in code that is relatively read and document with english category b b x y b y z b x z f g h a pipeline of three behaviors developers may be familiar with pipelines from using command line interfaces modern graphics processing or other flow programming models however many dataflow systems are based on streams rather than signals a signal describes one value as it varies over time streams are not so constrained often representing iteration over collections or sequence of independent events it is not difficult to model a signal in a stream or a stream in a signal but it still takes state and labor the default has a significant impact on programmer experience in reactive demand programming these pipelines will often represent continuous effectful observation and influence of time varying values for example load myimage svg renderjpg save myimage jpg this behavior while active would continuously load myimage svg  render it to a jpg value then save that result to myimage jpg of course this is continuous only in the logical abstract sense the implementation would only fully load render and save when first activated and when myimage svg changes aside the when first activated is often one time too many an alternative would be to observe timestamps and to activate this behavior when a difference is detected the notion of behaviors as dataflow networks is due to use of the complex signal types each concrete signal type s p a will have its own stream of signal updates different concrete signals may also be distributed across partitions the signal type s p x s p y describes a pair of concrete signals distributed across two partitions composition of distributed signals x y involves composing x and y independently this is supported by three primitive behaviors bfirst bprod b b x x b x y x y bswap bprod b b x y y x bassoclp bprod b b x y z x y z the bfirst constructor allows operating on just the x signal while bswap and bassoclp allow ad hoc dataplumbing to shift any subset of signals into the x position above these several utility functions can be built such as bsecond  bassocrp  and the operator bsecond bprod b b y y b x y x y bsecond f bswap bfirst f bswap bassocrp bprod b b x y z x y z bassocrp bfirst bswap bswap bassoclp bfirst bswap bswap bprod b b x x b y y b x y x y f g bfirst f bsecond g reactive demand programming provides many useful declarative properties developers can consequently collapse complex constructs into simple equivalent concepts i don t wish to start proving theorems in this readme but developers can reason that f g f g is equal to f f g g due to associativity of and spatial commutativity f g  f  g f and and and and bswap x x x x  and  and  g  and  and  bfirst f bsecond g f g bsecond g bfirst f spatial commutativity f g h f g h f f f f and  g and g g g f g f g f f g g bswap bswap id bfirst f bfirst f bfirst f f these properties make it easy to understand as describing concurrent composition of pipelines these networks can be much more complex e g foo bar baz qux would describe four concurrent behaviors on potentially distributed signals use of bswap  bassoclp  and bassocrp also allow developers to treat as at least conceptually associative and commutative those operations are explicit because haskell encodes the current permutation and association of signals in the type system to initially construct a concurrent dataflow one will generally use the behavior bdup to duplicate a signal reactive demand programming cannot create a signal from scratch but can duplicate a signal duplicating a signal will also duplicate the signal updates the branches won t begin to update independently until interacting with other resources conversely one can terminate a pipeline with bfst bdup bprod b b x x x bfst bprod b b x y x duplicating signals then using them in different ways enables developers to build complex dataflow networks sirea has decent dead code elimination if you duplicate a complex signal then filter them using bfst to get what you need sirea will skip duplicating the signals that aren t used on both paths more utility behaviors are derived from bdup and bfst bprod b b x y b x z b x y z f g bdup f g bsnd bprod b b x y y bsnd bswap bfst bvoid bprod b b x y b x x bvoid f bdup bfirst f bsnd and and bprod b b x y b x z b x x f and and g bvoid f bvoid g those last two constructors are especially useful they allow behaviors to conveniently represent declarative statements  i e behaviors that exist only for their declarative effects this is a close analog to the traditional imperative statements which are executed for imperative side effects declarative statements have nice properties that imperative statements do not especially being commutative bvoid f bvoid g bvoid g bvoid f f and and g g and and f and idempotent bvoid f bvoid f bvoid f declarative statements are also associative and have identity but those properties are common to imperative sirea performs its own compilation of behaviors which will eliminate most data plumbing and perform dead sink eliminations e g bdup will only duplicate the specific concrete signals that are needed on both paths in rdp the and and operator introduces a behavior that can only be observed through its effects on the environment this effectively describes a composition of agents for a multi agent system consider the following behavior let buildimage load myimage svg renderjpg save myimage jpg in let displayimage load myimage jpg displayjpg in buildimage and and displayimage here developers can justifiably understand buildimage as an agent with a very specific duty the same developer in a different context might understand buildimage as a pipeline this flexibility is useful which understanding serves best will depend on context the same can be said of displayimage multi agent systems work best when the agents do not name directly interact or name one another this keeps agents disentangled and provides developers much freedom to add remove or replace agents however multi agent systems often interact indirectly through shared resources in an open system in this case buildimage and displayimage interact indirectly through the filesystem sirea encourages the agent view at the higher level the sirea agentresource module simplifies breaking a complex application into one agent per task a typical sireaapp might be considered a single agent or a composite of toplevel agents in addition to the typed signals sirea supports and typed signals behaviors that process these signals describe switching networks where only one subnet is active at a time based on a decision upstream typically via bsplit most of the basic behaviors for have a dual for and bleft bsum b b x x b x and y x and y bmirror bsum b b x and y y and x bassocls bsum b b x and y and z x and y and z bmerge bsum b b x and x x binl bsum b b x x and y bright bsum b b y y b x and y x and y bassocrs bsum b b x and y and z x and y and z and and and bsum b b x x b y y b x and y x and y and and and bsum b b x z b y z b x and y z binr bsum b b y x and y with product  sum and  and unit s p  developers can represent arbitrary data types booleans composition of booleans into  bit numbers and so on without relying on a second paradigm of course this would be dreadfully inefficient on modern architectures without a lot of high level optimizations developers must also support interactions between the and and types the two basic interactions involve factoring a signal that occurs regardless of choice bconjoin  or distributing a signal across a choice bdisjoin conjoin is quite trivial duplicate filter and merge disjoin however requires a little extra attention factor x from a decision bconjoin bsum b bprod b b x y and x z x y and z bconjoin getx getyz where getx bfst and and and bfst bmerge getyz bsnd and and and bsnd distribute x across a decision bdisjoin bdisjoin b siginp p x b x s p y and z x y and x z for disjoin the s p signal represents the decision this is necessary because y and z may be complex signals distributed across arbitrary partitions the siginp p x indicates that x is fully in partition p sirea avoids any implicit communication between partitions the implementation duplicates each concrete signal in x then masks it with the decision signal for the left and the inverse decision signal for the right between disjoin dup and merge a few familiar utility functions can be defined bwhen  bunless  bifthenelse sadly there is no useful dual to the multi agent concept the dual to bvoid bskip b y x b x x seems useless except as a way to mark dead code sirea provides easy access for applying haskell functions and propagating haskell values bfmap bfmap b x y b s p x s p y bconst bfmap b c b s p x s p c bzap bzip b b s p x y s p x s p y bsplit bsplit b b s p either x y s p x and s p y  bzipwith fn bfirst bfmap fn bzap bzip bzipwith  bspliton fn bfmap fn bsplit where fn x if fn x then left x else right x these functions can support gathering and transforming data as needed to influence resources though some caution is warranted rdp is designed for real time systems developers should constrain themselves to functions that are either real time or close enough long running or batch processing functions should be modeled as an explicit process manipulating a stateful resource eventually i would like to compile behaviors for partitions outside the haskell process e g for client side javascript cg shaders or gpgpus this can still be achieved but it will take an extra layer that only partially compiles into sirea to constrain access to opaque haskell functions and types useful applications can be developed by composing a static set of behaviors in myriad ways but dynamic behaviors enable so much more discovery of resources open extension service brokering runtime upgrade live programming dynamic reconfiguration staged metaprogramming capability security patterns grant attenuation revocation  and flexible adaptation to a changing environment a behavior that allows dynamic behaviors is beval evaluation in reactive demand programming is a continuous act so what beval actually does is compile and install a dataflow network at runtime the installed behavior will change over time dynamically based on a signal ideally beval would look like this beval bdynamic b b s p b x y x y ideal this says that behavior type b can install a time varying instance of the same type supply some inputs and get some outputs unfortunately this ideal model has three weaknesses it does not indicate static latency between x and y  it does not work nicely for behavior transforms and it may require implicit communication between partitions if x is not in p to cover these weaknesses here is the actual beval behavior beval bdynamic b b  siginp p x dt b s p b x y x y and s p actual the dt value provides a static latency for the behavior and the s p output indicates an error which happens if you try to evaluate a behavior that is larger than the given dt value i d prefer to use dependent types for time but those aren t trivial to model in haskell the b inner type supports behavior transformers or layers the siginp p x constraint ensures all the x signals are in the same partition as the behavior signal dynamic behaviors can serve several of the same roles as and signals but and is more openly composable and may sometimes offer performance advantages no best practices are yet established for when to use sums vs dynamic behaviors for rdp but for a small number of commonly used statically known choices it will probably be better to favor sums note sirea uses speculative evaluation to compile and install dynamic behaviors a few seconds before they are necessary thus even though beval indicates only one behavior as active in practice multiple behaviors are installed and active computing recent past and near future in parallel if the dynamic behaviors are relatively stable and assuming the cpu can keep up with the higher burden this can reduce latencies experienced by the user caution compared to first class functions in haskell dynamic behaviors in sirea are relatively expensive and lack effective cross level optimizations dynamic behaviors for sirea should be relatively stable such that the expense of changing behaviors is amortized over time use dynamic behaviors where necessary for expressiveness but use them sparingly resources are often bound to a partitions broadly the notion of an rdp partition might extend to remote services tabs in a browser or particular gpus reactive demand programming is designed for automatic code distribution an rdp application behavior is compiled into shards subprogram behaviors that are distributed across many different partitions the shards can efficiently influence and observe resources local to that partition rdp addresses historically legitimate fears of hosting untrusted code in three ways in rdp capabilities are dynamic behaviors which are provided by signals which are implicitly traceable and revocable there is never any risk in an rdp system of authorities being grandfathered into the system due to lack of visibility or foresight the cause for every grant can be traced to a particular agent or behavior administrators have a free license for easy takebacks this is augmented further by rdp s open loop nature resources in rdp are external and external resources are easy to extend system with new diagnostics alerts observations rdp is designed for real time systems the space time costs associated with any behavior or shard are statically predictable this is important from a security perspective to control against denial of service or buggy code that enters infinite loops rdp developers who need infinite loops must use external state resources which are easy to diagnose unfortunately sirea does none of these things for convenience with haskell s module system sirea uses type driven resource access which is effectively an ambient authority unless types are propagated in certain ways sirea does not enforce real time anything though does encourage soft real time sirea s scope is limited to the haskell process in sirea the notion of a partition equates to a humble haskell thread the binding of resources to threads in haskell is mostly for convenience e g for easier state resources organization and occasionaly for safety e g for ffi resources opengl tls glfw event queues etc but within this limited scope sirea does model automatic code distribution partitions are named by type a concrete signal s foo x specifies a signal exists in partion foo a unique thread for that partition will be created based on a partition typeclass when the partition is needed the bcross behavior allows signals to move between sirea partitions bcross bcross b partition p partition p b s p x s pf x the automatic code distribution aspect is obvious when some behaviors are presented as occurring in another partition than the one you started in consider foo bcross bar here the bar behavior may be computed in a different partition than the partition in which foo was computed information bout bar must be delivered to the second partition while sirea is currently constrained quite severely to live within one haskell process i would like to eventually explore lifting sirea to operate in open distributed systems this can potentially be achieved by using higher level behaviors that compile to a mix of sirea local and remote behaviors where the remote shards are more constrained since i m considering something similar to support client side rdp for sirea webapps pages as dynamic behaviors compiling some code to javascript for a client browser i am considering to provide a limited variation of this feature as part of sirea webapps even without distributed behaviors sirea can interact with distributed resources this is achieved by modeling a local proxy to a remote resource the proxy can expose failure modes e g when the network is not available it takes time for signals to propagate through a behavior if you twiddle a few bits in the input signal it might be microseconds to milliseconds before you see bits twiddling in the output short term it is often convenient and harmless to pretend that the latency is zero but as application behaviors grow in scale it can prove harmful the physical latency grows faster than logical latency and signal updates straggle through the network falling behind real time eventually you get signal updates telling you what you should have done many milliseconds ago when it is too late to handle them those straggling updates can be used for retroactive corrections to state providing rdp a degree of eventual consistency but for many effects e g sounds played images rendered a signal too late is no good use of explicit logical delay provides developers more control over their rdp computations bdelay bdelay b dt b x x the behavior bdelay will delay a signal logically fundamentally the idea is to turn straggling updates into future updates instead of an update too late the update might arrive a little early based on the distance between logical and real time future updates are subject to speculative evaluation anticipation and buffering the delay can mask variance in physical latency hiding scheduler hiccups and similar choosing too large a delay has its own disadvantages most reactive or real time systems have a tight latency budget beyond which the quality of the system rapidly degrades further it results in larger buffers and memory overheads so developers in rdp are under some pressure to specify delays that are large enough but not too large fortunately developers do not need to be very precise or accurate most resources are robust to an occasional straggler and the window for good enough is quite large in most problem domains in many cases computation latencies can be entirely subsumed by communication latencies i e such that developers only add delay at bcross the bdelay behavior be applied to components signals in a complex signal type e g bfirst bdelay   to delay the first signal  milliseconds this is why rdp has asynchronous products and sums for its signal types but when signals become asynchronous it is often desirable to synchronize them for an operation some operations in sirea will implicitly synchronize bzip  bmerge  or bdisjoin but a behavior for an explicit synchronization barrier is also available bsynch bdelay b b x x the bsynch behavior will take every concrete signal in x and delay it to match the signal with the highest logical latency this allows developers to synchronize signals without being explicitly aware of their latencies synchronization barriers can be very useful for controlling side effects ensuring multiple resources and subsystems operate in concert a behavior is compiled into a concrete dataflow network that uses haskell io for propagation this network is then activated by the first signal update signal updates are also used to deactivate the behavior i e by indicating the signal is inactive after a certain time the use of bcross allows different parts of a behavior to compute in different partitions where each partition is represented by a different haskell thread between partitions signal updates are batched into one outbox for each destination the contents of those outboxes are delivered atomically at the end of the step at the start of each step all available batches are processed multiple updates for one signal will piggyback be combined into one update a bounded buffer mechanism is applied at the batch level between partitions ensuring fairness and controlling space costs step driven batch processing ensures an atomic snapshot view of other partitions within and between rounds snapshot consistency is weaker than glitch freedom by observing one resource through lenses of two different partitions temporary inconsistency is possible but snapshot consistency eliminates local glitches which are the cause of most problems within each step updates are processed in three phases first every link with a pending update is touched to indicate an update will be coming on that link second every local update is processed with bcross updates going to the relevant outbox third mailboxes are delivered the update ordering problem is a performance concern for push based reactive systems with complex or ad hoc acyclic dependencies for example assume a system whose dependency graph looks like a b c d e k and and and and and and and and and and f g h i j in this graph dependencies flow left to right along the lines for example c depends on b and g assuming there are pending updates on a and f  there are multiple orderings in which the updates could be processed afbgchdiejk an optimal update ordering abhdjkciekgcdekfbhdjkghcdeiejk a non optimal ordering a risk when we touch is that we might later decide that an update can be filtered or delayed so we don t have a real update in that step when that happens we ll send an idle rather than a real update rdp behaviors do not directly express cycles but can indirectly introduce feedback cycles through external resources for example readfile foo txt bdelay   bfmap foo writefile foo txt this behavior presumably models a hz cycle that continuously reads and writes the same file assuming there are no filesystem errors or write conflicts the frequency determined by bdelay   each cycle delays   seconds this delay is logical i e the thread is not paused  but ultimately results in a corresponding wall clock delays and thread frequencies note rdp developers are not encouraged to use cyclic feedback it is possible and sometimes unavoidable due to unknown dependencies in open systems  but feedback is difficult to control and reason about fine grained resources e g using separate state resources for requests and results can help avoid cycles a concern for partition local cycles is that the touch mechanism may result in a cyclic wait to resolve this there is also a test for partition local cycles that involves passing a unique identifier and listening for the same value detected partition local cycles are then broken across the next step ensuring progress for performance reasons involving potential rework it is preferable to detect cycles and perform as much processing within each step as possible i ve mentioned signal updates touch idle and test for partition local cycles these operations are directly reflected in the lnkup type that is used to implement behaviors data lnkup a lnkup lntouch io  lnupdate stablet t sig a io  lnidle stablet io  lncycle set unique io  this is used under the hood most users of sirea shouldn t need to know or use lnkup but it occasionally will be valuable for developing new resource adapters or special behaviors sirea rdp is an excellent target for parallelism in haskell for a few reasons the x y asynchronous products clarify data dependencies this makes it easier for developers to judge where introducing parrallelism is advantageous very little parallelism will be wasted the concrete signal type s p a implemented by sig a provides a clean separation between the spatial and temporal aspects of data it is easy in sirea to specify that the spatial computations occur in parallel while the temporal spine of the signal is left to incremental sequential processing the use of signal updates with explicit stability supports speculative evaluation and optimistic concurrency similar to lightweight time warp protocols parallelism via optimistic concurrency is really trading efficiency for latency and robustness but is a very nice way to use that extra cpu use of bcross models distributed behaviors potentially multi processor systems which are inherently parallel state resources are explicit and external to rdp and persistent there is no risk of lazy parallel folds becoming space leaks sirea provides several convenience functions for developers to control the timing of computations on data bstrat bfmap b b s p eval a s p a bseq bfmap b b s p a s p a bspark bfmap b x b s p x s p x bforce bfmap b x b s p x s p x bstratf bfmap b functor f forall e f e e b s p f x s p x bspark is the most accessible mechanism to add parallelism to a sirea behavior it will spin off one spark for each value in a signal but for only a few values at a time incrementally relative to stability  and downstream clients will wait on this computation to finish as though it were strict this eliminates risk of losing parallelism but has the disadvantage of not being very compositional the reduction x is any sequential strategy usually rnf from control deepseq the bforce behavior is similar but will evaluate in the current partition s thread a potentially useful idiom is to use bspark just before bcross  such that lazy values are computed in transit the above behaviors are a sirea user s primary tools to control the whens and wheres of lazy evaluation but lazy evaluation is not the only performance concern other concerns involve caching memoization choking signals and eliminating redundant updates the notion of choking signals involves skipping high frequency intermediate updates to a signal and showing only the occasional snapshot this is a very different notion from filtering signals choking is inherently a stateful concept because it must hold onto information about the past at the very least when the last snapshot was selected the motivation for choking is usually to either dampen feedback cycles a dubious application or to support a fast producer in feeding a slow consumer in sirea choking will be modeled always with support of intermediate stateful resources and i m considering creating a dedicated resource just for choking some resources may also perform their own ad hoc choking e g an opengl resource might not display faster than the framerate demanded even if there are many possible intermediate frames an intelligent choke might support a signifigance function i e choking based on time but allowing a few extra values through if the values are somehow interesting for eliminating redundant updates sirea does have a ready answer badjeqf bfmap b eq x b s p x s p x adjacent equality filter this behavior can improve performance by eliminating many redundant signal updates there is some cost to perform the filter of course so it should be used judiciously but there may be significant downstream savings for bfmap  bzap  and similar and much rework avoided note bconst has a simple variation of badjeqf built into it this is the main advantage of using bconst instead of bfmap const resources  resources exist outside the rdp program but may be programmatically accessed by rdp behaviors resources generally include sensors actuators and state specific examples include keyboard mouse graphics display sound output filesystem database network external services and ffi can be usefully treated as resources signals to resources tend to represent continuous queries or commands resources in rdp are demand driven at any given instant the a resource is influenced by the set of active demands on it and since signals may represent live queries each distinct signal may have a distinct response the breadth and variety of of sensors human input devices output devices and foreign services is enormous further for every resource there are many api design choices that affect performance portability safety and ease of use users of sirea especially early adopters must occasionally step outside of rdp composition to develop resource adapter preferably in a bsd licensed package prefixed with sirea the process of adapting a resource typically involves introducing a thread to provide resource specific polling maintenance or event loops and making some state accessible to behaviors also resources often have dependencies on other resources configuration information or state it is convenient to push most logic into rdp and to model a resource as exclusively controlled by another rdp application or agent partitions introduce threads with programmable actions between rdp steps pcx simplifies access to state for resource proxies and adapters bcx will distribute a pcx context object to primitive behaviors agentresource models resources as controlled by separate rdp apps demandmonitor pushes ad hoc demand tracking logics up into rdp those are explained in detail in the associated modules sirea   will include packages supporting the most commonly accessible resources mouse keyboard graphics web state filesystem sound time developers should hopefully need to write adapters only for more domain specific or esoteric resources and services and even then only for resources that nobody else has adapted effectively but when those situations occur the aforementioned features will keep it from being too onerous specific resources will be discussed in their corresponding packages however a few broad resources and idioms will be discussed here rdp is stateless logic on a stateful grid the motivation for developing rdp behaviors is ultimately to observe and influence stateful resources towards some end even sensors and actuators are abstractly means to observe and influence a stateful environment state is always external to rdp behaviors orthogonal persistence is very natural the precise temporal semantics make concurrent shared state much easier in rdp than it would be in most imperative models however programmers from imperative backgrounds must learn new ways of thinking about state and controlling it rdp influence on state is commutative idempotent and continuous there are many systems that have these characteristics tuple space systems where demands insert or delete tuples on a set rules based systems where demands impose rules that predictably influence state timed state systems where states are animated by timeouts cooldowns or schedules machine learning where the state is implicit to a learning or clustering model but is not easy to control history based state which simply records the values pushed to it possibly with some expiration or decay model a simplistic rules based state model is the reactive state transition system the resource is in some state initially  each demand adds a directed bridge between states such as  the state follows a predictable path across these bridges going as far as it can if rule  is added the state will transition from  to  then immediately from  to  assuming the  bridge is still available ambiguity might be resolved predictably by favoring the lowest numbered state an instantaneous cycle might be resolved by settling in the lowest state reactive state transition could serve a similar purpose as a state machine it could be augmented with time e g by adding a cooldown time to each transition it could also be augmented with a stack e g for a structured state transition system that requires every trip to be a round trip a very useful constraint there are much more expressive rules systems available e g based on term rewriting or temporal logic an advantage of universally external state besides orthogonal persistence is the reduced competition or interference between state models rdp behaviors can easily orchestrate many heterogeneous state resources and developers may introduce new ones if those from sirea state prove insufficient an important restriction on state in rdp is that state cannot hold onto dynamic behaviors this restriction is valuable for security resource management and persistence sirea enforces this property via haskell s type system in a distributed system this can be structurally enforced at serialization to record a behavior statefully e g for mobile agent abstractions  represent that behavior as code or data then compile that code into the dynamic behavior resources may be influenced by the set of active concurrent demands thus a simple useful resource could respond to demands with the set of active concurrent demands this concept is called the demand monitor  and is of great practical value for rdp systems demand monitors and a few variants are among the few resources provided by sirea core demand monitors don t directly respond to demand with the set of demands an artificial requirement to provide a demand just to observe demands would be inconvenient and would reduce stability instead there are two separate facets of a demand monitor one to receive demands one to monitor demands each distinct demand monitor resource is represented in rdp by a unique pair of behaviors demands received by a particular demand monitor are only observable to systems that hold the corresponding monitor facet b s p x s p receives demands b s p s p x monitors demands the basic demand monitor actually returns a haskell list in some indeterminate order not all demands developers might wish to monitor have an ord class in that case it is up to developers to provide the extra discipline to treat the list as a set however there are variations that will return a sorted uniquified set of demands one variation of demand monitor is possibly the simplest useful resource the activity monitor an activity monitor is essentially a demand monitor for the unit signal the monitor responds with a simple boolean indicating whether there is any demand at all b s p s p receives activity b s p s p bool monitors activity demand monitors and activity monitors are typically composed into more complex behaviors to track demands and use of resources demand monitors are also useful as a volatile blackboard for communication between agents or as a registry for publishing available services or plugins dynamic behaviors demand monitors have a severe weakness a large set of demands will tend to be much less stable than any of the contributing signals this is because an update to any constituent signal will require an update to the monitored signal a suggested practice for demand monitors is to use many fine grained demand monitors one for each role or responsibility also if possible favor variations of demand monitors that narrow the set of responses e g the activity monitor or a k maximum monitor reactive demand programming is designed to pervasively support speculative evaluation each signal update carries information about that signal s future from tens of milliseconds up to a few seconds in the future though information about the future is not always stable or accurate many resources can easily leverage this speculative information a file system adapter can asynchronously pre load files that it anticipates it will need in a second a world model might leverage projected updates to improve the quality of current estimates and predictions a constraint model might use projected future constraints to choose solutions that can be expected to remain stable for longer a robotic arm might use speculative commands to plan a smoother motion note early rdp designs have bpeek dt b s p x s p maybe x  such that developers could anticipate on ad hoc signals unfortunately bpeek breaks merge equivalence bpeek   and and and bpeek   bmerge is not equivalent to bmerge bpeek   because the former will anticipate periods of inactivity where the latter does not merge equivalence is essential for dynamic behaviors because it allows us to treat dynamic behaviors semantically as if they are continuously expired and replaced anticipation now is leveraged only at resources but remains useful resources in rdp systems are generally demand driven  i e driven by the set of demand signals that query or influence the resource demand driven resource management is naturally very robust if a demand signal is disrupted for any reason e g decision network failure switching dynamic behaviors  it will be removed from the set of demands on the resource if all demands are removed the resource can return to an idle or hibernation state and resource proxies handles buffers etc can be removed from process memory conversely when demand on a resource is introduced or some time before using anticipation it is easy to load the necessary resources prepare local proxies and buffers and so on rdp structurally enforces a property called duration coupling for every behavior the input signal has the same activity of the output signal modulo delay basically you only get a value while you re demanding one duration coupling ensures that when demand is disrupted upstream it is disrupted downstream after a very predictable latency it also makes job control and shutdown very easy in rdp an application is halted but cutting the initial demand signal and this naturally propagates through the entire rdp behavior demand driven resource management is sufficient for most cases especially those relevant within a single process stateful resource management can still be expressed if necessary model a separate rdp agent to observe state and maintain the demands on behalf of the client this might be necessary in a distributed system for long term disruption tolerance possibly by a mobile agent abstraction push code to the remote partition that can compile to an rdp behavior as with any explicit resource management discipline and design are necessary to use it safely rdp is designed to support resource management and sane partial failures in open distributed systems with buggy or malign services and clients rdp has no need for global gc ephemeron tables or messy hand written timeouts rdp supports runtime discovery of resources via first class dynamic behaviors discovery of resources will be achieved through an intermediate resource e g broker registry matchmaker by discovering and reactively utilizing available resources rdp applications can adapt themselves for their environments rather than a static configuration rdp applications can continue to adapt as the environments change over time resources are always external to rdp behaviors consequently rdp lacks an equivalent to the new expression often used in oop no newioref or newunique use of new plays havoc with dynamic behaviors orthogonal persistence extensibility and declarative properties fortunately simple resource discovery idioms can achieve the same purpose compute stable unique locators for resources locate resource in an abstract resource space a locator might involve urls session keys domain values and so on the stability of the locator should be on the same order as the desired lifetime the abstract resource space is a resource that can be navigated via arbitrary locators to find useful resources generally in a default state a tree shaped resource space where each subtree is a recursive resource space is nearly ideal path names can be stabilized using meaningful domain values can be securely partitioned no path from child to parent subtree level operations feasible reset clone splice parent can easily observe and influence child resources readily supports orthogonal persistence and versioning you re probably thinking hey that s basically a filesystem and you re right a filesystem metaphor to manage resources is superior in every way to use of new the tree structure is discoverable extensible auditable persistable securable composable and suitable for declarative access with a little discipline to ensure stability of schema and locators the tree structure effectively supports live programming the ability to audit and discover resources is useful for visual presentation developer awareness and debugging sirea includes abstractions for resource discovery pcx supports type based resource discovery via data typeable and a resourcespace uses strings for discovery users of sirea at least those not involved with developing resource adapters should never need new note one may also provide resources or services an agent becomes a service provider by publishing a dynamic behavior and metadata to a shared registry such that potential clients can discover it rdp provides a feature i ve never seen in another paradigm effective support for first class composable frameworks leveraging first class behaviors bidirectional reactive dataflow and support for effects many systems that would require painful inversion of control and concurrent event managers in an imperative oop model can be represented as straight behaviors in rdp since frameworks are just behaviors multiple frameworks are easily composed and will have precise predictable concurrency properties similarly rdp is suitable for modeling first class overlay networks a single behavior can span many partitions and manage communication between them by publishing a few services for external agents these overlay networks can introduce ad hoc patterns for communication they can also perform many network layer optimizations such as caching or content delivery my intuition is that these features make rdp far more expressive than i have yet imagined or fathomed at the moment i only imagine to use frameworks for easy staged metaprogramming to model compilers service brokers etc programming with control flow is implicitly and pervasively stateful to achieve scalability developers redundantly duplicate the implicit state to make it explicit e g with command patterns and queues and object relational mappers implicit state in control flow models seems to be a source of many scalability woes rdp is not implicitly stateful rdp is not a control flow paradigm however rdp systems can model explicit state resources and rdp systems easily react to changes in state by causing more changes in state with some cooperative discipline and design developers can model any control flow component mailboxes stacks queues data streaming promise pipelining barriers etc rdp is very expressive for modeling ad hoc control flow systems further many of rdp s fringe benefits survive the control flow abstraction orthogonal persistence precise logical concurrency speculative evaluation and anticipation ability to audit and debug control state in live systems finally control flow will be at higher levels since the underlying rdp can handle a lot of drudge work for data gathering data synchronization job control and low level resource management but i strongly encourage developers to favor declarative designs imperative abstraction invites imperative issues control flow should be a technique approached with second thoughts and reluctance simpler declarative effects will often suffice

8108978, swipetodismissundolist  the swipetodismissundolist is a library to add swipe to dismiss functionality to a listview and undo deletions again the lib is based on    introduced setswipedirection and improved detection of swipes    use abslistview instead of listview to make this library also available for gridviews changes required you need to change the parameter in the ondismiss method to abslistview see below    added minimum sdk version to manifest    properly discard undo items bug fix as an android library to your project the project should work from api level  upwards if you find that this isn t true might be that i missed some newer methods  please inform me about that to use the list create a regular listview e g via a listactivity and wrap it up in the swipedismisslist of this lib listview listview and and findbyid or getlistview swipedismisslist ondismisscallback callback and and see below undomode mode and and see below swipedismisslist swipelist new swipedismisslist listview callback mode you would normally want to do that in your oncreate method the second parameter to the constructor of swipedismisslist is an ondismisscallback you must implement that to handle the deletion of elements swipedismisslist ondismisscallback callback new swipedismisslist ondismisscallback public swipedismisslist undoable ondismiss listview listview int position and and delete the item from your adapter sample code final string itemtodelete madapter get position madapter remove itemtodelete return null if you return null from the ondismiss method your deletion won t be undoable to make your deletion undoable you must return a valid undoable implementing at least its undo method  that restores the element again swipedismisslist ondismisscallback callback new swipedismisslist ondismisscallback public swipedismisslist undoable ondismiss abslistview listview final int position and and delete the item from your adapter sample code final string itemtodelete madapter get position madapter remove itemtodelete return new swipedismisslist undoable public void undo and and return the item at its previous position again madapter insert itemtodelete position you can override gettitle in the undoable to provide an individual title for the item that has been deleted that title will be shown beside the undo button in the popup if you don t override that method or it returns null the default deletion message will be shown in the popup you can change this message with swipedismisslist setundostring string you can return null from the ondismiss method in general to disable undo on the list or just on special items you don t want or cannot undo if you want to get notified when the user doesn t have a chance to make the undo anymore meaning the popup dialog vanished see below  just override the undoable discard method in your undoable this will be called as soon as the popup dialog vanishes you can e g really delete items from the database in that callback that was just hidden beforehand if you implement the discard method you need to call swipedismisslist discardundo in the onstop method of your activity see also leaky popup leaky popup below otherwise some items might not receive the discard call when e g the device is rotated an pseudo example of a complete ondismisscallback swipedismisslist ondismisscallback callback new swipedismisslist ondismisscallback and and gets called whenever the user deletes an item public swipedismisslist undoable ondismiss abslistview listview final int position and and get your item from the adapter madapter being an adapter for myitem objects final myitem deleteditem madapter getitem position and and delete item from adapter madapter remove deleteditem and and return an undoable implementing every method return new swipedismisslist undoable and and method is called when user undoes this deletion public void undo and and reinsert item to list madapter insert deleteditem position and and return an undo message for that item public string gettitle return deleteditem tostring and deleted and and called when user cannot undo the action anymore public void discard and and use this place to e g delete the item from database finallydeletefromsomestorage deleteditem the undo popup will be hidden automatically after some time after the user has touched the screen after the deletion the delay until it will hide is by default  seconds you can change that value with the setautohidedelay int method that takes a new delay in milliseconds by default the user can swipe an item left or right to delete it with this method you can limit it to the left or right side see the javadoc of setswipedirection and swipedismisslist swipedirection for further information the undo list can handle multiple undos in three different ways you define the way with the third constructor parameter if you don t pass in an argument the default mode will be swipedismisslist undomode singleundo only the last deletion can be undone as soon as the user deletes another item from the list this will be undoable but the previous won t be anymore this mode is a multilevel undo when the user deletes an item while there is still the undo popup shown for a previous deleted one both items will be saved for undo pressing now undo will undo the last deletion pressing undo after that the deletion that has done before and so on as soon as the undo popup vanishes all stored undos will be discarded by default the undo popup shows a message with the amount of deleted items in this mode you can change this message with the setundomultiplestring string this message can contain one placeholder d that will be filled with the amount of stored undos if you pass null to that method the undo popup will always show the individual message returned by undoable gettitle for the last deletion the one that will be undone by a click on undo if there is no individual message for an undoable the default message setundostring string will be shown instead this mode collapsed multiple undos into one when the user deletes an item while an undo popup is already shown the new undo is stored from now on the user sees an undo all instead of undo button a click on that will undo all stored deletions if the popup vanished due to the auto hide delay passed all stored undos will be discarded you can again use setundomultiplestring string to set an individual message also passig null is possible but doesn t make too much sense in that case since the user will only see the last undo messgae but all deletions will be undone if you want to customize the look and feel just modify the resources as you like you can internationalize the undo and undo all string in your own resources by adding a string for the name undo and one for undoall this library only provides the english translation you can pause the dismiss behavior of the list for some time by using the setenabled boolean method on the swipedismisslist for bugs and feature requests please use the github issue tracker i haven t limited the library to any android api versions but it might be that it doesn t work on very old versions so please feel free to tell me via an issue i will then try to fix it when the popup is shown and the device is rotate it causes an exception to be thrown this is nothing really bad but you can and should prevent that exception by calling swipedismisslist discardundo in the onstop method of your activity if you have implemented the discard method see above notification about final delete you must call this method or you will find me often in android dev on irc freenode net

1781184, tir web framework the state agnostic lua micro framework  programming language the purpose of tir is to play with the idea of a state agnostic web framework tir lets you create handlers that work in various configurations as needed by your application requirements you create your application using a natural coroutine style natural style handler then make another part stateless stateless style  and still have other parts using an evented and callback style evented style getting started  tir is very alpha but it is being used on a few projects feel free to grab the code and if you want to help then contact zedshaw at zedshaw com for more information the source to tir is available at install instructions and more information can be found on the tir website at tir s philosophy  tir s philosophy is that the framework creator shouldn t be shoving stateful and stateless dogma in your face and that it s possible to support various state management styles tir allows you to use different state management strategies for different interfaces you need to design if a part of your application is a complex process then natural style is the way to go if there s a single url service then stateless style is the easiest if you have a url and action for say a rest api then evented style works great the point though is that different problems are best solved with different state management natural style  i m calling the coroutine based handlers natural style because you write the code for them in a more natural way as if you don t need to worry about routing and state management you can code up entire complex processes and interactions using the natural style very easily for example pagination is difficult in stateless servers but it s just a repeat and until loop in natural by default handlers are natural style and maintain a coroutine for each user and let you write your code using phrases like prompt  recv  page  and local loginpage tir view login html local loginform tir form loginname  password local function login web req local params loginform parse req repeat params web prompt loginpage form params loggedin false until loginform valid params return web redirect and tir start route and login  main login stateless style  handlers can be made stateless and they ll work like coroutine handlers but not retain any state these are good for one shot operations and simpler actions that don t need much routing local searchpage tir view search html local searchform tir form q local function search web req local params searchform parse req local q params q local results if searchform valid params then local pattern q upper for i cat in ipairs categories do if cat upper match pattern then results results and  cat end end end web page searchpage results results q q tir stateless route and search  main search evented style  tir also supports the alternative evented style which means that urls are mapped to callback functions in your handler a simple url pattern is used to transform your and route and action style urls into a function to call best of all evented operation can be combined with stateless the default or coroutines so you can easily refactor complex url schemes if you need local manage form tir form id  action function manage people web req params do whatever managing people does function manage cats web req params whatever managing cats means if that s possible function manage dogs web req params ah way easier to manage dogs manage config route and manage  tir evented manage in this style manage form is run and then your handlers receive the results to work with right away you can even change the routing pattern if you don t like what i ve chosen or need even more complexity in your life simple templating language  tir uses embedded lua as it s templating language which means you get a real language and not some crippled one someone smarter than you thinks you should be using and lua already looks like most of the nice template languages out if results gt  then lt ul gt for result in ipairs results do lt li gt result lt and li gt end lt and ul gt else lt p gt we ll add q as a new one lt and p gt end multiple little processes  tir also uses zeromq and mongrel to run the application as a set of small processes for each major routing rather than one monolithic process in the above two examples each tir start line is a single process you can also build on this to flex and warp the size of your processes as you need and locate them or cluster them however you like by default it shoots for small little processes but nothing prevents you from doing others builtin background tasks  tir task lets you create and connect to ready to run mq background task processes so you can offload long running tasks and avoid holding up web requests they re designed to be very easy to use but still flexible enough to let you do what you need by default they use pub and sub sockets but you can change that with a setting you can also put the background tasks on clusters of machines and nearly anything else you need to do messages are simply just json encoded lua structures here s a task that just dumps it s args require tir and engine function test args tir dump args tir task start main test spec ipc and and run and photos and here s a sample handler that can talk to it require tir and engine local conn tir task connect spec ipc and and run and photos function main web req conn send photo  req headers web ok tir stateless route and task  main main unit test support  new in   tir now has decent unit testing in the tir and testing library and that shows how it s done async ready  because tir uses mongrel it already support async operation streaming regular http http long poll and flash and jssockets tir comes without an orm by default people would probably hate any orm i wrote and there s plenty of options you can add this isn t really a tir feature but don t you hate it when there s bugs in your core libraries and that guy who owns the broken library refuses to fix it me too that s why lua and luarocks are awesome you get a tight core language that s completely described in a few html pages and can install all the platform libraries you need with luarocks no more gatekeepers with lua
7264187, checkedthreads  checkedthreads is a fork join parallelism framework for c and c and and providing automated race detection using debugging schedulers and valgrind based instrumentation automatic load balancing across the available cores a simple api nested cancellable parallel loops and function calls if you have dozens of developers working on millions of lines of multithreaded code checkedthreads will let you painlessly parallelize the code and then continuously ship new versions without worrying about parallelism bugs it s based on a decade of experience in that kind of environment what race conditions will be found what race conditions will be found nice features nice features api api environment variables environment variables how race detection works how race detection works building and installing building and installing planned features planned features coding style coding style support and contact supportcontact what race conditions will be found  all of them checkedthreads provides two verification methods fast verification using a debugging scheduler that changes the order of events thorough verification using valgrind based instrumentation that monitors memory accesses and flags accesses to data owned by another thread there are more details below how race detection works the upshot is that every race condition will be found if it could ever manifest on the given inputs the bug is actually a race condition what looks like a race condition but isn t a race condition consider using uninitialized memory returned by malloc this is a bug regardless of parallelism this also leads to non deterministic results in parallel programs but the bug is not a race condition it s a memory initialization problem so while checkedthreads may help find the bug no guarantees are made unlike with pure race conditions nice features  how to choose a framework here are some nice features of checkedthreads you can compare other frameworks features to this list as you shop around pretty much guaranteed bug detection integration with other frameworks dynamic load balancing a c and a c and and  api free as in do whatever you want with it easily portable at least in theory custom schedulers guaranteed bug detection is a rare promise in the world of parallel imperative programs which have a bad reputation because of hard to chase bugs the api is designed with the goal of making it possible to find all parallelism bugs that could manifest on given inputs and tools are provided for doing so integration with other frameworks if your code already uses tbb or openmp you can have checkedthreads rely on tbb or openmp to run the tasks you create with the checkedthreads api this way you can use checkedthreads alongside another framework without the two fighting over the machine please tell if you d like to use checkedthreads alongside another framework such as ppl dynamic load balancing checkedthreads comes with its own scheduler where all tasks are put in a single queue and processed by the worker thread which is the quickest to dequeue it when using tbb or openmp checkedthreads tries to approximate this scheduling policy a single queue is not necessarily scalable to  cores but it otherwise provides optimal load balancing work gets done as soon as someone is available to do it the upshot is that you get nice performance on practical hardware configurations a c as well as a c and and  api no compiler extensions pragmas keywords etc are involved while c and and  lambdas and variadic templates are used to provide some syntactic sugar the underlying c api is useable directly as well free as in licensed under the freebsd license the  clause thing see license txt i ll gladly license the code under any other license if you want i originally just said do whatever you want with the code  but people worried that lawyers would much prefer a standard license portability very little is assumed about the target platform it is enough to have a c compiler and an address space shared by a bunch of threads in fact you don t even need threads as in an os with preemptive scheduling you could rather easily port checkedthreads to run on a machine without any os however currently checkedthreads is only developed and tested on linux ubuntu  please tell if you have problems using it on another platform or if you want it to be easier to build on another platform custom schedulers if you prefer a different scheduling policy you can implement a scheduler of your own you need to implement the same  function interface that is used to implement the schedulers supplied together with checkedthreads another nice feature at the moment is simplicity and small size however these were known to transform into complexity and large size in the past an effort will be made to avoid that there are also missing features please tell if a feature you need is missing making a list of everything not there is a tad hard one biggie currently is concurrency no means are provided to wait for events except for issuing a blocking call which steals a thread from the underlying thread pool so it s not any good really generally concurrency is not currently a use case checkedthreads is a framework for parallelizing computational code which does not interact much with the external world in a nutshell you can parallelize loops with ctfor and function calls with ctinvoke both parallel loops and function calls can be nested a parallel loop or a set of parallel function calls can be cancelled before they complete examples using the c and and  api ctxfor  int i ctxfor  int j array i j i j absolutely boneheaded code but you get the idea i and j go from  to  currently there s no way to specify a start other than  or an increment other than  there s also no way to control grain size each index is a separately scheduled task so a non trivial amount of work should be done per index or the scheduling overhead will dwarf any gains from running on several cores for a better example here s parallel sorting template class t void quicksort t beg t end if end beg minpar int piv beg l  r end beg while l r if beg l piv l and and else std swap beg l  beg r  std swap beg l  beg  and and sort the two parts in parallel ctxinvoke quicksort beg beg and l  quicksort beg and r end  else std sort beg end not unlike ctxfor ctxinvoke calls all the functions it s passed in parallel no function call scheduled by ctxinvoke nor any iteration of ctxfor should ever access a memory address modified by any other call and iteration that is they should be completely independent once ctxfor and invoke returns all the memory updates done by all the iterations and function calls can be used by the caller of ctxfor and invoke now a c example void setelem int i void context int array int context array i i void example void int array  ctfor  setelem array  that last  is a null pointer to a canceller we ll get to that in a moment meanwhile parallel invoke in c void a void context int context  void b void context int context  void example void int first second cttask tasks a first  b second    ctinvoke tasks  the tasks array should have  as its last element again the  argument is the canceller speaking of which here s an example of actually using cancelling int posof  ctcanceller c ctalloccanceller ctxfor n int i if arr i  posof i ctcancel c ctfreecanceller c again a silly piece of code doing way too little work per index but no matter notes on cancelling everything can be cancelled ctfor ctxfor ctinvoke and ctxinvoke can all get a canceller parameter a single canceller can cancel many things ctcancel c cancels all loops and parallel calls to which c was originally passed nested loops and calls don t automatically inherit the canceller when a loop is cancelled no more iterations will be scheduled but all iterations which are already in flight will be completed if such an iteration itself spawns tasks then those tasks will not be canceled unless the spawning iteration explicitly passed to the tasks it spawned the same canceller which cancelled the loop that the spawner belongs to at most one iteration and function call can write something to memory otherwise different results might be produced depending on timing because cancelling is not deterministic different iterations may be cancelled in different runs for instance the example above is only correct if arr is known to keep at most one value equal to  the last thing to note is that you need before using checkedthreads to call ctinit and then call ctfini when you re done ctinit gets a single argument the environment for example ctenvvar env ctsched  shuffle  ctrandrev      ctinit env you can pass  instead of env if you do that ctsched and ctrandrev will be looked up using getenv similarly if you do pass an env  all variables not mentioned in it will be getenv d the available environment variables and their meaning are discussed in the next section environment variables  ctsched is the scheduler to use and can be one of serial run loops serially from  to n and call functions first to last shuffle serial run with a pseudo random deterministic order of iterations and function calls valgrind same order as shuffle but also communicates with the valgrind checker telling it what s what tbb schedule tasks using tbb s simplepartitioner with grain size of  openmp schedule tasks using openmp s pragma omp parallel for schedule dynamic pthreads default schedule tasks using a worker pool of pthreads and a single shared queue ctthreads is the worker pool size relevant for the parallel schedulers the default is a thread per core ctverbose at  all indexes are printed at  loops and invokes at  default  nothing is printed ctrandseed a seed for order randomizing schedulers shuffle valgrind ctrandrev if non zero order randomizing schedulers will reverse their random index permutations when this is useful is explained in the next section how race detection works  as mentioned above there are two verification methods a fast one and a thorough one the fast one is run the program twice using two different serial schedules a random schedule and then the same schedule reversed env ctsched shuffle ctrandrev  your program your arguments env ctsched shuffle ctrandrev  your program your arguments now compare the results of the two runs different results indicate a bug because results should not be affected by scheduling order in production a parallel scheduler is used and it can result in things running in any of the two orders you just tried and many other orders using this method you can run the program on many inputs the program runs serially with the shuffle scheduler so you can spawn a process per core to fully utilize machines used for testing many inputs and no result differences give you a rather high confidence that your program is correct however this method has two drawbacks some bugs go unnoticed for instance updating a shared accumulator from several iterations of a loop may not work with a parallel scheduler but such updates will yield the same results under all serial schedules so will the use of a shared temporary buffer bugs are not pinpointed different results prove that there s a bug but they don t tell you where it is because of these drawbacks a second slower and more thorough verification method is available env ctsched valgrind ctrandrev  valgrind tool checkedthreads your program your arguments env ctsched valgrind ctrandrev  valgrind tool checkedthreads your program your arguments if valgrind says failed to start tool checkedthreads  perhaps valgrindlib should be set to point to the right place this runs valgrind with the checkedthreads tool which monitors every memory access when a thread accesses a location that another thread concurrently wrote the tool prints the offending call stack checkedthreads error thread  accessed xff xff  owned by   at xc std functionhandler void int  main lambda int  minvoke std anydata const  int bug cpp   by x ctvalgrindforloop valgrindimp c   by xc ctvalgrindfor valgrindimp c   by xc ctfor ctapi c   by xed main bug cpp  note that there aren t any actual threads like the run under ctsched shuffle this run is serial rather the valgrind tool maps ctfor loop indexes and ctinvoke function calls to thread ids such that those ids can fit into a single byte so two threads accessing the same location means that the location was accessed from two loop indexes and function calls that could run in parallel this second method is slower but it doesn t miss any bugs that could ever occur with the given inputs and it pinpoints the bugs so it s a good idea to run the program under valgrind on a few inputs in case plain shuffling misses bugs and it s also useful to run the program under valgrind on those inputs where shuffling discovered bugs to pinpoint those bugs this is all you strictly need to know to verify your code if you want more details for instance if you want to be convinced that the bug coverage is indeed as thorough as claimed above you can read note that there can be no deadlocks because there are no locks the only way to synchronize threads is forking the spawning of loops or joining the termination of loops so there s no need for deadlock detection tools building and installing  it is recommended that you read the following explanations about building from sources and then decide which parts you want to build and which parts you prefer to download in binary form so after cloning and downloading sources cd checkedthreads and configure configure is a python script producing a single output include and checkedthreadsconfig h you can edit this file manually all it has is defines telling which of the optional features are enabled note that make then checks what s defined in config h and adjusts compiler flags etc define ctcxx enable c and and  the c and and parts of the code are compiled with std c and and x define ctopenmp enable openmp code is compiled with fopenmp define cttbb enable tbb define ctpthread enable pthreads code is compiled with pthread and configure enables each of these features if it auto detects that it s supported on your machine you might then want to disable some features even though they re supported on your machine at this point you can build the libraries with make build  but plain make won t work yet because things must be manually configured to build the valgrind tool to do that edit defaults mk and set the following variables ctvalgrindsrcdir the directory with the valgrind sources to build the tool you need to download configure and make valgrind first the valgrind tool was developed with valgrind    the binaries seem to work with    as well but i didn t try to build with the    sources valgrindlib your system s default such as and usr and lib and valgrind  or the directory you passed to valgrind s configure with prefix or some other existing directory if you wish the checkedthread tool binaries are copied to this directory ctvalgrindcp sudo cp by default can be plain cp if you have permissions to access valgrindlib without sudo note that valgrindlib is used by the tests which make runs after building everything make sets this environment variable for all the processes it spawns you may need to explicitly set valgrindlib when running valgrind tool checkedthreads outside make also note that setting in the shell running make any of the environment variables mentioned in defaults mk overrides their values hence the name defaults mk with defaults mk edited you can build everything and run tests with make help will list the available make targets and options such as make clean and make verbose  currently every build rebuilds everything from scratch there s no dependency checking  which is tolerable at the current size of things after a successful build you get libraries at lib and as follows every library is available both as a static lib a file a dynamic lib so file libcheckedthreads and and has all the enabled features libcheckedthreads has all the enabled features except those relying on c and and the c and and  api and the tbb based scheduler if openmp is enabled libcheckedthreads and and openmp is created that has all the enabled features but only one parallel scheduler the one based on openmp libcheckedthreadsopenmp is similar except that it also doesn t use c and and similarly if pthreads are enabled libcheckedthreads and and pthreads and libcheckedthreadspthreads are built similarly if tbb is enabled libcheckedthreads and and tbb is built but not libcheckedthreadstbb because tbb requires c and and this variety of libraries should hopefully make it easy to link with checkedthreads in any scenario at this point you can install checkedthreads that is copy the files in lib and to wherever you keep your libraries and copy the files in include and to wherever you keep your header files if you want to download binaries instead of building the available binaries are listed the slightly gnarlier thing to build but to build the libraries from sources for example planned features  planned features not yet avaialable proper checking of cancelling cancelling is only ok if at most one thread writes things custom allocator interface to tell the checker when memory is allocated and freed a compiler llvm and gcc pass in addition to the dynamic valgrind instrumentation a windows build and integration with ppl coding style  everything prefixed with ct ctx for c and and identifiers  except for struct members globals prefixed with gct and gctx no static variables all are extern indentation tbs  spaces per level no hard tabs everything is lowercase underscoreseparated macros mostly uppercase valgrind tool code at valgrind and should try to use valgrind style code should compile without warnings i d use werror but different gcc versions have different warnings style isn t that important support and contact

4935611, nodefront is a node js powered command line utility that speeds up front end development installation is simple with npm npm install g nodefront upgrading nodefront should be done by reinstalling like so npm uninstall g nodefront npm install g nodefront compile nodefront compile compiles a variety of templating and built languages see compile command below  including by default jade stylus and coffeescript can compile upon modification serve nodefront serve serve files on localhost automatically refresh the browser and styles when files are changed fetch nodefront fetch automatically fetches css and js libraries for use in your project provides an interactive mode to add new libraries insert nodefront insert inserts css and js libraries directly into your html or jade files minify nodefront minify minifies css and js files can also optimize jpg and png images nodefront compile options the compile command by default will look for all jade jade  stylus styl stylus  and coffeescript coffee files in the current directory without recursing see the recursive option and compile them to their html css and js counterparts simply replacing the extension of the originally named file to employ any of the above languages other than the three defaults you ll need to install their respective engines for example if you d like to use ejs you ll need to run npm install g ejs then simply create files with the extension corresponding to the engine you re using e g ejs for ejs files and nodefront will automatically compile them when you run the compile command if the directory structure initially looks like and  index jade and  styles styl  script coffee after running nodefront compile  index jade will be compiled to index html  styles styl will be compiled to styles css  and script coffee will be compiled to script js  resulting in the following new directory structure and  index jade and  index html and  styles styl and  styles css and  script coffee  script js help nodefront compile h and help outputs usage information about the compile command recursive nodefront compile r and recursive recurses through sub directories instead of only compiling files in the current directory watch nodefront compile w and watch watches all files that can be compiled in the current directory and subdirectories if the recursive option is specified and recompiles them upon modification watch is dependency aware meaning that if index jade extends and includes layout jade  when layout jade is modified both layout jade and index jade will be recompiled this same awareness is present for stylus files as well output nodefront compile o and output directory outputs all compiled files into the given output directory if not provided this defaults to the current directory npm install g marked jade should automatically interface with it language compilers often come with a variety of options for example jade has the option of compressing html upon compilation nodefront allows you to set these options via configuration files to do so simply create a nf directory anywhere in your project tree this means that nf can be present directly in your project directory or in any of its parent directories then add a compile json or compile yml file with a compileroptions map each key should be a file extension and the value should be a map of options to pass to the compiler for that extension for example to tell jade to output pretty html instead of compressing it you can use the following nf and compile json file compileroptions jade pretty true  the yaml equivalent nf and compile yml  would look like compileroptions jade pretty true nodefront serve options port hostname if the directory structure looks like and  index html and  css  styles css and  js  script js running nodefront serve in the directory with no options would allow you to access the three files above using the following urls compile nodefront serve c and compile will run nodefront compile w and watch simultaneously this allows you to modify files that need to be compiled and immediately see the updates in your browser output nodefront serve o and output directory should be specified only if the c and compile option is used this will output all compiled files into the given output directory specified by directory if not provided this defaults to the current directory note that this is simply done by passing directory to the o and output option of the nodefront compile command live nodefront serve l and live will monitor each html page that is served to the browser and all of its css and js dependencies if the page s source itself or one of its scripts changes the browser will automatically refresh if a css stylesheet is modified it will be reloaded without refreshing via a cache busting query string this allows for live development with immediate feedback and circumvents the need to keep reloading the browser manually for those who are interested in the more technical aspects of live mode the server that is created automatically injects web socket code courtesy of socket io into html pages this allows for communication between the client and the node js server whenever a file is modified the server notifies the client via the established socket connection the client then assesses whether this file affects the current page and takes appropriate actions nodefront fetch library options the fetch command will download the given css and js library library  from the web and add it to the current directory nodefront is already aware of many of the most popular css and js libraries but can easily be configured to fetch lesser known ones to fetch the latest version of jquery simply run nodefront fetch jquery jquery    as of  and  and  will then be added to the current directory if for instance you d like to fetch version   simply use the version option specified by v or version nodefront fetch jquery v   jquery   should then be downloaded into the current directory help nodefront fetch h and help outputs usage information about the compile command type nodefront fetch library t and type type will set the type or extension of the given library library when the library has finished downloading it will then be named library version type note that the type defaults to js if this option is not given output nodefront fetch library o and output directory downloads the given library and stores the resultant file see type option above  in the given directory directory version nodefront fetch library v and version version downloads the given library at the provided version number version  and saves it to library version type see type option above interactive nodefront fetch library i and interactive enables interactive mode where you ll be provided with numerous dialogs that fully explain the process of adding a new library you can alternatively specify all the configuration parameters necessary by using the command line see options below note that if necessary you can mix and match as well specifying the url parameter while also going into interactive mode to get some help setting the path url nodefront fetch library u and url url will fetch the library file at the given url url  and add it to the current directory with the name library version type see version and type options above to make this flexible for different versions of the library simply add the parameter version where the version should be inserted in the url then the version parameter see above will determine what value this gets replaced with note that if you specify the url for a library all configuration options are automatically saved meaning that you can fetch the library again at any time simply by running nodefront fetch library if you ever need to update the configuration options again specify the url once more path nodefront fetch library p and path pathregex requires the url parameter to be provided see above it then assumes that the url points to a zip file extracts all files within it and finds the first one to match the regular expression pathregex this file will be considered the library you were looking for and is then downloaded minify nodefront fetch library m and minify will fetch the given library and minify it upon download note that both css and js libraries can be minified nodefront insert librarypath file options the insert command will insert the css or js library given by the path librarypath  into the html or jade file specified by file as either a link or script tag if librarypath ends in css  a link tag will be appended to the head of the document in like manner if librarypath ends in js  a script tag will be inserted in the footer prior to the end of the body see head option for inserting into the head to insert a script tag containing jquery at the end of index html run nodefront insert jquery    js index html if instead you would like the script tag to be appended to the head tag simply specify the head option specified by h or head nodefront insert jquery    js index html h nodefront insert jquery    js index html a to remove jquery    js from a file add the delete option specified by d or delete nodefront insert jquery    js index html ad make sure to maintain the absolute option if the original insertion used an absolute path help nodefront insert help outputs usage information about the insert command head nodefront insert librarypath file h and head will append the given library to the head of the document by default css libraries are added to the head as they cannot be added elsewhere and js libraries are added prior to the end body tag absolute nodefront insert librarypath file a and absolute will use the absolute path of the given library librarypath  as the value of the src and href attribute to the script and link tag that is inserted by default a relative path is used tab length nodefront insert librarypath file t and tab length length will use the provided tab length length  when inserting the script and link tag by default the tab length is  representing four spaces if you would prefer hard tabs t characters  simply specify  as the tab length delete nodefront insert librarypath file d will delete the library from the given file instead of inserting it make sure to maintain the absolute option see above if the original insertion used an absolute path for the src and href attribute nodefront minify fileregex options the minify command finds all file paths in the current directory without recursing see the recursive option  that match the given fileregex it then minifies the corresponding files using uglifyjs for js files yui the js implementation for css jpegtran for jpeg and optipng for png by default the output file name is the original file name without its extension followed by min and the original file name s extension for example if the original file name is style css  the new file name is style min css to minify script js in the current directory into script min js run nodefront minify p script js the plain option specified by p or plain  changes fileregex from a regular expression to just a plain text string to minify all css files in the current directory simply use the css option c or css with no fileregex parameter nodefront minify c in like manner the js option j or js  and the images option i or images  minify js files and optimize all images respectively you can mix and match these options as necessary to minify all css js and image files in the current directory for example run nodefront minify cji help nodefront minify help outputs usage information about the minify command recursive nodefront minify fileregex r and recursive will minify all file paths in the current directory and in any sub directories that match the regular expression fileregex plain nodefront minify fileregex p and plain will change fileregex from being a regular expression to just a normal text string with this option enabled you can pinpoint the exact file you would like to minify by setting fileregex to its path type nodefront minify fileregex t and type type will set the type of all the files that are being minified normally the type of a given file is determined by its extension with css js png and jpg or jpeg representing css js png and jpeg files respectively if you would like to minify a file without an extension or with one that does not match these defaults this option will let you force nodefront to treat it as if it had the extension type for example running nodefront minify p script t js would minify script as if it was a js file even though it lacks a js extension out nodefront minify fileregex o file will minify all file paths in the current directory that match the regular expression fileregex and put the output in the file named file include name in file and it will be replaced by the name of the current file being minified without its extension in like manner include extension in file and it will be replaced by the extension of the current file being minified for example assume you have the following directory structure and  main script js  main style css if you run nodefront minify main o name minified extension  main script js will be minified to main script minified js and main style css will be minified to main style minified css leaving you with the following new directory structure and  main script js and  main script minified js and  main style css  main style minified js this option defaults to name min extension if not provided overwrite nodefront minify fileregex w and overwrite will overwrite files will their minified versions instead of writing to name min extension see out option this is a shortcut to specifying name extension for the out option css nodefront minify c and css will minify all css files in the current directory this is a shortcut to nodefront minify css js nodefront minify j and js will minify all js files in the current directory this is a shortcut to nodefront minify js images nodefront minify i and images will minify all jpeg and png images in the current directory this is a shortcut to nodefront minify jpg and jpeg and png note that the last three options can be mix and matched as necessary to for example minify all css and js but no images like so

nolib jquery and can be loaded asynchronously for async loading controljs is a good option but any async loading library or technique should work see the wiki and iamnoah and writecapture and wiki and usage for more detailed usage need help see help below writecapture js was developed using jquery    but should work with most versions we recommend you use jquery because it s pretty great however if that s not possible there is support and nolib support js which provides a bare bones implementation of the support functions jquery would otherwise provide and only adds about  bytes when gzipped to use nolib support just grab the latest writecapture x x x nolib min js from the downloads section it already includes writecapture js so it s the only file you need if you d like the unminified source for debugging simply include nolib support js before writecapture js note that nolib does not implement onload  which is required for autoasync if you already have another ajax library you are using like prototype or dojo you can implement write capture support yourself and iamnoah and writecapture and wiki and writecapturesupport sometimes we are forced to use a third party script or markup that we simply cannot change usually an ad server while our websites are sleek and snappy with a nearly pristine codebase and progressive enhancement and ajax everywhere many rd party libraries are still using tables for layout and the dreaded evil document write method what makes document write so evil is that it is only useful for scripts inside the body tag that are processed while the page is loading if document write is called anytime after page load it wipes out all the existing page content that makes it very difficult to dynamically refresh content containing document write calls fortunately for you difficult is not impossible and writecapture js has already written and extensively tested the difficult part for you all you have to do is give it the offending evil html and it will return nice clean html safe for injection into the document if you use writecapture and want some free advertising let us know are a lot of workarounds to try before giving up demonstrating the problem is rarely helpful because we can t go and edit the source please take the time to reproduce it on js fiddle so we can help you please do not email the author privately or open an issue in the issue tracker the author does not actively use write capture so he probably does not have any idea what is causing your problem you may think that it is quicker to go straight to the mailing list or the author without taking the time to isolate the problem and fully read and comprehend the documentation and go over the source code but anyone who can help you has already done all of those things please respect our time and you will get enthusiastic help adsense adsense code using document write will not work however adsense provides asynchronous tracking support adsense  so you don t even need writecapture to load adsense asynchronously if any of the included scripts are on another domain they will have to be loaded asynchronously via script tag injection subsequent scripts in the html will be blocked so order will be preserved but this means that not all scripts may have yet run after the html is injected this means that if your script depends on all the scripts in the html having run it should utilize the done callback scripts that assume that they are the last element in the document will probably not function properly this is rare but if a script is uncouth enough to use document write it s a possibility is not great it adds extra span tags and is not nearly as robust as a full library like writecapture that s why writecapture provides a plugin and iamnoah and writecapture and blob and master and cjs writecapture js to replace control js s document write support with writecapture js for usage see the wiki and iamnoah and writecapture and wiki and controljs and and call from ready or your document ready of choice writecapture extsrc donecallback advantages all the power of writecapture js so more document write edge cases will work no extra span tags all scripts with extsrc will be run in order so you don t have to worry about dependencies note that you do not need extsrc js we are simply supporting the same syntax in writecapture hacks updated proxygetelementbyid will attempt to copy attributes from the proxy when jquery is present should improve compatibility in some cases writeongetelementbyid for when proxying isn t enough new experimental feature autoasync inspired by all options and hacks can now be set globally and and or per call no more eval fixes a problem in ie where var variables were not visible to other scripts enough to be version   fixed bug in pause and resume logic when using asyncall that was preventing execution from resuming fixed error in ie when using proxygetelementbyid big overhaul of the internal queuing system it should be more robust and  deterministic from this point forward known to help with deeply nested cross domain scripts fixed issue where scripts that include newlines in their src attribute were being truncated added debugging support see support and debug support js writecapture js has matured enough to be close to a   release after a little seasoning if you have a problem with your ad server or other code submit a bug report added hacks to support scripts that combine document write with dom for the bug reports and example code enabling proxygetelementbyid should help with some ad servers fixed a number of issues with marginal scripts but if all scripts were in good shape you wouldn t need writecapture should help with some ad servers bugfix jquery    has a bug in replacewith that mishandles strings we work around it by not using replacewith added fixurls hack to deal with encoded urls added mit and gpl licenses applied retroactively to all versions optimized script loading start loading in parallel immediately if asyncall is enabled replaced sanitizeall with sanitizeserial created jquery plugin run all sanitized scripts through a global queue to prevent problems when multiple sanitizes with async loads are run in sequence added html and replacewith convenience methods added load convenience method only tasks that were running async read async script loading with pause and resume will result in a call to defer allowed replacement of support functions by defining writecapturesupport so writecapture can be used without jquery added nolib support js for using writecapture without jquery first release any content but a single script tag would result in partially async execution thanks to an overuse of defer

3760843, welcome to ocpdfgen this is a library that was created by mobile world software in the creation of our own products we hope you enjoy it this very basic library allows developers to create well formatted text pdf files on ios devices from css formatted html the html is parsed using the excellent dtcoretext framework from cocoanetics which then turns the html string into an nsattributedstring a coretext formatter is used to format the text onto pages and full pagination support is enabled this code is great for creating pdf files on the fly without the use of a server i think that speaks for itself in my own projects i ve often had to write pdf rendering code and have benefited from using other s implementations on forums i thought i d contribute my own work back the current coretext pdf formatter does not include the image or high level functionality that the dtcoretext libraries do so no img hr table commands most text functions have been implemented by dtcoretext and are rolled into the nsattributedstring that is parsed from the html the usage is very simple open the demo app and you ll quickly see how it works you provide the app your html as utf formatted nsstring it will take that html parse it place it on a pdf context and save the pdf file to the app s documents folder the class will then return the path to this pdf file to your app in the demo app i hand the path off to a uiwebview so you can demo how the pdf looks the class also handles nsattributedstring if you ve already generated that though if you can already generate the nsattributedstring i d suggest just taking the ct framesetter in the app and separating it out into its own class no need for the relatively heavy dtcoretext you can also supply a straight nsstring if you re ok with arial font and standard formatting drag the dtcoretext folder into your project if you have enabled arc then dtcoretext will be happy if not then you ll have to add the fobjc arc flag to all of the dtcoretext files in the compile sources section of the build phases tab of your target then drag in ocpdfgenerator include it in the files where you need to render pdf s and leave it be side note dtcoretext depends on arc i don t like arc so i ve just enabled it for the files in dtcoretext in the demo project this code is released under the bsd license you can use it in commercial and non commercial code with attribution

6525647, i got bored of using other people s validators that didn t work just as i wanted so i created one this is not a jquery plugin but does depend on jquery there s a demo included in the demo and folder if you re not sure on the documentation you should look at the demo first it contains a pretty solid example on how to use the library all the main methods are also covered in the tests so between this document the demo and the tests you should be set any problems raise an issue or tweet jackfranklin the basic idea goes that you have a html form and you set up your validator and add some validations javascript var userform window formvalidator input type text and and add your validations userform addvalidation username  minlength  required true userform addvalidation shortname  maxlength  then when the form is submitted see if those validations pass or not javascript var validationresult userform runvalidations if validationresult valid h text form validated and and you might just want to loop through all errors from all fields and display them h text all errors for var i  i validationresult messages length i and and text validationresult messages i appendto ul and and or loop through the errors for each field and add them just after the field in a span tag for var field in validationresult fields var fieldobj validationresult fields field if fieldobj valid class error  text fieldobj messages join   fieldobj html after errorspan you can add your own validation methods too javascript addvalidationmethod exactlength  function val arg return val length arg  field f has to be arg characters these are further documented below once a field is added you can also get at its attributes and a jquery object containing the element not particularly useful but may come in handy javascript console log userform field username attributes and and name username type text console log userform field username html and and input type text name username if anything s not clear the best place to look is the tests every public method is tested in there create a new variable to store your form in javascript var signupform formvalidator then call methods on signupform adds a field to the form validator that you can then validate against argument can either be any valid css selector any that you would pass into jquery  or a jquery object if the jquery object has multiple elements only the first will be saved field is added to the internal fields object which are index by the field s name attribute same as addfield  but handles multiple elements passed in either pass in an array of css selectors or a jquery object pass in a string which is the name of the field and you get an object back representing it rarely useful response javascript attributes type text  name foobar you can combine the adding of fields with the initial step for example instead of javascript var signupform formvalidator signupform addfields foo you can do javascript var signupform formvalidator foo takes the field name and an object of validations and runs them returning the response for example javascript validatefield username  minlength  required true and and returns valid true and and if the validations passed or failed messages and and any error messages that were returned works identically to validatefield with one key exception it adds a validation but doesn t run it you can also add multiple validations in two different ways either javascript addvalidation username  minlength  required true javascript addvalidation username  minlength  addvalidation username  required true the first is preferred but the second may be useful if you need to programatically add validations at different times clears all pending validations so none remain new in    returns a more complex object with each field s messages individually along with the field s jquery object runs all pending validations returning a response object if you pass in an argument of true  it clears the pending validations object completely the response is like so javascript valid true and and boolean true or false if the entire validation set was valid messages  and and array of error messages of all fields combined fields username field and and the same object you would get from calling yourform field username attributes type text  name username  messages  and and error messages for just that field valid true and and boolean true and false for if that field was valid or not returns the pending validations as a key value object with the key being the field name and the value being the validation string sample response javascript username minlength  required true email maxlength  not used particularly often right now only a few validation methods exist out of the box they are minlength x the value must have at least x characters maxlength x the value can have up to x characters required the value cannot be blank lengthbetween xy value must have at least x characters but no more than y matches str value must match str exactly there are more to come but until then if you end up writing some please post them on github and i ll happily pull them in there s also methods to add validations pass in the validation name and an object of properties javascript var newmatches message field f must equal arg  fn function val arg return val arg addvalidationmethod matches  newmatches name is the name you ll refer to when adding validations to a field obj should contain two fields fn is the function that s run to test the validation it s passed three arguments the value of the field you re validating against the parameter s it s called with a jquery object containing the field it s unlikely you ll ever use the third parameter but it s there if you need it a validation method just needs to return true or false message is the method s error message these contain placeholders which are documented below for example the minlength validation function looks like so javascript function val arg return val length arg because i know minlength will only take one argument i can just reference the variable passed in validation methods are only passed in an array of arguments if they take more than one if they only take one that one value is passed in compare the above to the lengthinbetween validator javascript lengthbetween message field f must be a minimum of args  characters and a maximum of args   fn function val args var len val length return len args  args  len notice how i don t even bother referencing the rd argument as i wont need it usually just the field s value is all you ll need message is the error message that is returned if the validation fails this is just a string but it has a couple of placeholders f is used to show where the field name will go in the string if your validation method takes one parameter use arg in the message string as a placeholder as to where that will go for example here s the minlength message field f must be at least length arg if your validation method takes  arguments refer to the arguments as args   args  and so on for example here s the lengthbetween message field f must be a minimum of args  characters and a maximum of args  here s an example of how i d add an exactlength validator javascript addvalidationmethod exactlength  fn function val arg return val length arg message field f has to be arg characters which could then be used as exactlength  it s likely that you might want to change the built in messages that come out of the box you can do this through two methods returns an object that represents a validator example getvalidationmethod matches javascript message field f must match arg  fn function val arg return val arg pass in the validation name and an object to save it javascript var newmatches message field f must equal arg  fn function val arg return val arg savevalidationmethod matches  newmatches and that s it a good place to start is demo and demo js  which has a plain example to get you going in the right direction this project uses grunt js for testing linting and deploying install grunt js npm install g grunt then clone and cd into this repository and run npm install now you should be able to run grunt to lint test concatenate and minify tests are written in jasmine and can be tested with grunt jasmine you can run linting with grunt lint run lints and tests with grunt test if you make a pull request please write tests for it jackfranklin joshstrange add nodejs support test and document cross browser support version    added fields method which returns the fields object of a jfv instance version    add methods to jfv prototype  not just to the jfv object version   support amd libraries like requirejs switch to using proper semantic versioning from this point on generated a docco build file see docs and rewrote library as a js class public api usage hasn t changed support validating checkboxes as well as text fields version   changed the response object to return each field and its error messages indidividually thanks joshstrange for the initial idea and some of the code version   fixed a typo in the readme thanks joshstrange use regex to replace within messages thanks joshstrange integrated into grunt js see section on contributing version   made it onto hacker news thanks to a suggestion on there ditched using strings for validations and switched to js objects which make much more sense so instead of javascript addvalidation username  minlength  and required it s now javascript addvalidation username  minlength  required true a few things have changed as a by product of this please do read the docs carefully any questions please ask away version   rewrote the validation methods so they are passed in three arguments value args obj realised most methods will only care about the field value so pass that in directly rather than just the object to streamline the validation methods object is passed in as rd argument if it is needed version   ability to add fields through the formvalidator method runvalidations takes optional argument which if set to true will clear pending validations once run added getpendingvalidations method version   first release

2601967, oauth   authorization server as a rack module because you don t allow strangers into your app and oauth the authorization server needs to keep track of clients authorization requests access grants and access tokens that could only mean one thing a database the form of a mongo db object because mongodb is schema less there s no need to run migrations if mongodb is not your flavor you can easily change the models to support a different database engine all the persistence logic is located in lib and rack and oauth and models and kept simple by design and if you did the work to support a different database engine send us a pull request for rails   and   rack oauth server automatically adds itself as middleware when required but you do need to configure it from within config and environment rb or one of the specific environment files for example rails initializer run do and config and config afterinitialize do config oauth database mongo connection new mydb config oauth authenticator lambda do and username password and user user find username user id if user user authenticated password for sinatra and padrino first require rack and oauth and sinatra and register rack oauth sinatra into your application for example require rack and oauth and sinatra class myapp sinatra base register rack oauth sinatra oauth database mongo connection new mydb oauth authenticator lambda do and username password and user user find username user if user user authenticated password with any other rack server you can use rack oauth server and pass your own rack oauth server options object the configuration options are accesstokenpath path for requesting access token by convention defaults to and oauth and accesstoken authenticator for username and password authorization a block that receives the credentials and returns identity string e g user id or nil authorizationtypes array of supported authorization types defaults to code  token  and you can change it to just one of these names authorizepath path for requesting end user authorization by convention defaults to and oauth and authorize database mongo db instance this is a global setting expiresin number of seconds an auth token will live if nil or zero access token never expires host only check requests sent to this host path only check requests for resources under this path paramauthentication if true supports authentication using query and form parameters realm authorization realm that will show up in  responses defaults to use the request host name logger the logger to use under rails defaults to use the rails logger will use rack logger if available collectionprefix prefix to use for mongodb collections created by rack oauth server defaults to oauth if you only intend to use the ui authorization flow you don t need to worry about the authenticator if you want to allow client applications to create access tokens by passing the end user s username and password then you need an authenticator this feature is necessary for some client applications and quite handy during development and testing the authenticator is a block that receives either two or four parameters the first two are username and password the other two are the client identifier and scope it authenticated it returns an identity otherwise it can return nil or false for example oauth authenticator lambda do and username password and user user findbyusername username user id if user user authenticated password the gem will automatically handle jwt assertions if you want to be able to configure your own function to handle custom assertion types you can follow this example for facebook com that will allow the following use case  mobile device authenticates with facebook receives accesstoken  mobile device sends accesstoken to the server as an assertion  if the server recognizes that facebook accesstoken as belonging to an existing user return our oauth accesstoken as a normal accesstoken request if it doesn t return unauthorized  in application rb or other initializer with scope to config oauth config oauth assertionhandler facebook com lambda do and client assertion scope and rails logger debug assertion assertion graph koala facebook graphapi new assertion userdata graph getobject me rails logger debug fb user data userdata user user findbyfacebookauth uid userdata id rescue exception e fall through rails logger debug could not find and load facebook user assertion and e if user rails logger debug valid facebook assertion user id tos requires a string or integer rails logger debug invalid facebook assertion if you want this to be called then your client needs to send its assertion like this json format here granttype assertion  assertiontype facebook com  assertion fb access token authorization requests go to and oauth and authorize rack oauth server intercepts these requests and validates the client id redirect uri authorization type and scope if the request fails validation the user is redirected back to the client application with a suitable error code if the request passes validation rack oauth server sets the request header oauth authorization to the authorization handle and passes control to your application your application will ask the user to grant or deny the authorization request once granted your application signals the grant by setting the response header oauth authorization to the authorization handle it got before and setting the response header oauth identity to the authorized identity this is typicaly the user id or account id but can be anything you want as long as it s a string rack oauth server intercepts this response and redirects the user back to the client application with an authorization code or access to signal that the user denied the authorization requests your application sets the response header oauth authorization as before and returns the status code  forbidden rack oauth server will then redirect the user back to the client application with a suitable error code in rails the entire flow would look something like this class oauthcontroller applicationcontroller def authorize if currentuser render action authorize redirectto action login  authorization oauth authorization def grant head oauth grant currentuser id def deny head oauth deny rails actions must render something the oauth method returns a helper object rack oauth server helper that cannot render anything but can set the right response headers and return a status code which we then pass on to the head method in sinatra and padrino it would look something like this get and oauth and authorize do if currentuser render oauth and authorize redirect and oauth and login authorization oauth authorization post and oauth and grant do oauth grant superman post and oauth and deny do oauth deny the view would look something like this h the application linkto h oauth client displayname  oauth client link is requesting to oauth scope tosentence your account and h form action and oauth and grant button grant and button input type hidden name authorization value oauth authorization form action and oauth and deny button deny and button input type hidden name authorization value oauth authorization rack oauth server intercepts all incoming requests and looks for an authorization header that uses oauth authentication scheme like so authorization oauth eebfcfaaafece it can also support the oauthtoken query parameter or form field if you set paramauthentication to true this option is off by default to prevent conflict with oauth   callback if rack oauth server finds a valid access token in the request it sets the request header oauth identity to the value you supplied during authorization step  you can use oauth identity to resolve the access token back to user account or whatever you put there if the access token is invalid or revoked it returns  unauthorized to the client however if there s no access token the request goes through you might want to protect some urls but not others or allow authenticated and unauthenticated access the former returning more data or having higher rate limit etc it is up to you to reject requests that must be authenticated but are not you can always just return status code  but it s better to include a proper www authenticate header which you can do by setting the response header oauth noaccess to true or using oauthrequired to setup a filter you may also want to reject requests that don t have the proper scope you can return status code  but again it s better to include a proper www authenticate header with the required scope you can do that by setting the response header oauth noscope to the scope name or using oauthrequired with the scope option in rails it would look something like this class mycontroller applicationcontroller beforefilter setcurrentuser oauthrequired only private oauthrequired only calc scope math authenticated and un authenticated get different responses def public if oauth authenticated render action more details render action less details must authenticate to retrieve this def private render must authenticate with scope math to do this def calc render text  and   protected def setcurrentuser currentuser user find oauth identity if oauth authenticated in sinatra and padrino it would look something like this before do currentuser user find oauth identity if oauth authenticated oauthrequired and private oauthrequired and calc  scope math get and public do if oauth authenticated render more details render less details get and private do render secrets get and calc do render  and   before a client application can request access there must be a client record in the database registration provides the client application with a client id and secret the client uses these to authenticate itself the client provides its display name site url and image url these should be shown to the end user to let them know which client application they re granting access to clients can also register a redirect url this is optional but highly recommended for better security preventing other applications from hijacking the client s id and secret you can register clients using the command line tool oauth server oauth server register db mydb or you can register clients using the web based oauth console see below programatically registering a new client is as simple as and script and console loading development environment rails    client rack oauth server register displayname uberclient  scope read write  puts your client identifier client id puts your client secret client secret you may want your application to register its own client application always with the same client id and secret which are also stored in a configuration file for example your db and seed rb may contain oauth yaml loadfile rails root and config and oauth yml rack oauth server register id oauth clientid  secret oauth clientsecret  when you call register with id and secret parameters it either registers a new client with these specific id and sceret or if a client already exists updates its other properties i ll let you figure that one for yourself rack oauth server also supports the so called two legged oauth flow which does not require the end user authorization process this is typically used in server to server scenarios where no user is involved to utilize the two legged flow send the granttype of none along with the clientid and clientsecret to the access token path and a new access token will be generated assuming the clientid and clientsecret check out rack oauth server supports the use of assertions in the form of the assertion granttype to obtain access tokens currently json web tokens jwt are the only supported assertiontype in order to verify the signatures of assertions you will need to create assertion issuers you can register assertion issuers using the command line tool oauth server oauth server registerissuer db mydb programatically registering a new issuer is as simple as and script and console loading development environment rails    hmacsecret foo  publickey begin rsa public key n n n end rsa public key n when you call registerissuer it either registers a new issuer with these specific values or if an issuer already exists with the given identifier it will update it s properties depending on the algorithm used for signing the assertion hmac sha or rsa  you pass either hmacsecret or publickey to rack oauth server registerissuer or both if you will use both with a single issuer the value of publickey can be either a pem or der encoded public key as supported by openssl pkey rsa new rack oauth server validates that the issuer iss  principal prn  audience aud and expiration exp claims are present it also validates that the expiration claim has not passed with a  minute padding added to account for server clock skew we haz it and it s pretty rad to get the web admin running you ll need to do the following first you ll need to register a new client application that can access the oauth web admin with the scope oauth scope and redirecturi that points to where you plan the web the easiest way to do this is to run the oauth sever command line tool oauth server setup db mydb next in your application make sure to only authorize administrators to access the web admin by granting them access to the oauth admin scope for example def grant only admins allowed to authorize the scope oauth admin if oauth scope include oauth admin currentuser admin head oauth deny head oauth grant currentuser id make sure you do that or you ll allow anyone access to the oauth web admin after this remember to include the server admin module in your initializer environemnt rb or application rb  because this is an optional feature require rack and oauth and server and admin next mount the oauth web admin as part of your application and feed it the client id and secret for example for rails   x add this to config and environment rb rails initializer run do and config and config afterinitialize do config middleware use rack oauth server admin mount rack oauth server admin set clientid dcaecb rack oauth server admin set clientsecret faefcfcbffbaf rack oauth server admin set scope w read write for rails   x add this to you config and application rb module myapp class application rails application config afterinitialize do rack oauth server admin set clientid dcaecb rack oauth server admin set clientsecret faefcfcbffbaf rack oauth server admin set scope w read write end and add the follownig to config and routes rb mount rack oauth server admin and oauth and admin for sinatra padrino and other rack based applications you ll want to mount like so e g in config ru rack builder new do map and oauth and admin run rack oauth server admin map and run myapp rack oauth server admin set clientid dcaecb rack oauth server admin set clientsecret faefcfcbffbaf rack oauth server admin set scope w read write you can set the following options clientid client application identified require to authenticate clientsecret client application secret required to authenticate authorize endpoint for requesing authorization defaults to and oauth and admin templateurl will map an access token identity into a url in your application using the substitution value forcessl forces all requests to use https true by default except in development mode scope common scope shown and added by default to new clients array of names e g read  write the oauth web admin is a single page client application that operates by accessing the oauth api the api is mounted at and oauth and admin and api basically and api relative to the ui  you can access it yourself if you have an access token with the scope oauth admin the api is undocumented but between the very simple sinatra code that provides he api and just as simple sammy js code that consumes it it should be easy to piece together the premise of oauth   is that you can use it straight from the command line let s start by creating an access token aside from the ui authorization flow oauth   allows you to authenticate with username and password you ll need to register an authenticator see step  above for details now make a request using the client credentials and your account username and password e g f granttype password f clientid dcaecb f clientsecret faefcfcbffbaf f scope read write f username assaf labnotes org f password not telling this will spit out a json document something like this scope import discover contacts lists  accesstoken eebfcfaaafece grab the accesstoken value and use it the access token is good until you delete it from the database making a request using the access token although not recommended you can also pass the token as a query parameter or when making post request as a form you ll need to set the option paramauthentication to true watch out since this query parameter could conflict with oauth   authorization responses that also use oauthtoken for a different purpose here s a neat trick you can create a curlrc file and load it using the k option cat curlrc header authorization oauth eebfcfaaafece if you create curlrc in your home directory curl will automatically load it convenient but dangerous you might end up sending the access token to any server you curl useful for development testing just don t use it with any production access tokens example using the assertion granttype f clientid dcaecb f clientsecret faefcfcbffbaf f granttype assertion f assertiontype urn aietf aparams aoauth agrant type ajwt bearer f assertion eyjexaioijkvqilcjhbgcioijiuzinij eyjpcmioijodhrwoivddlnnvbwvjbwywlmnvbsisimfzciimhdhalydcubxljbwywlmnvbsisinbybiiijeymzqnjcotaifq bdrcogybtjndaqyegnuwxmrolxseyc you can use the server module to create fetch and otherwise work with access tokens and grants available methods accessgrant creates and returns a new access grant you can use that for one time token e g users who forgot their password and need to login using an email message tokenfor returns access token for particular identity you can use that to give access tokens to clients other than through the oauth   protocol e g if you let users authenticate using facebook connect or twitter oauth getaccesstoken resolves access token string into access token accesstoken object listaccesstokens returns all access tokens for a given identity which you ll need if you offer a ui for uses to review and revoke access tokens they previously granted getclient resolves client identifier into a client object register registers a new client application can also be used to change existing registration if you know the client s id and secret idempotent so perfect for running during setup and migration getauthrequest resolves authorization request handle into an authrequest object could be useful during the authorization flow registerissuer registers a new assertion issuer can also be used to change existing issuers idempotent so perfect for running during setup and migration getissuer resolves an issuer identifier into an issuer object this is briefly what the authorization flow looks like how the workload is split between rack oauth server and your application and the protocol the two use to control the authorization flow rack oauth server  client app and and oauth and authorize and and set request env and redirect and and and and and authenticate client and and oauth authorization and  your code  and authenticate user and and ask user to grant and and and set response and and and and deny client access and and and and and and to their account and and oauth authorization and and and and and and oauth identity and  rack oauth server  and create access grant and and or access token for and redirect back and oauth identity and to client app  the rack oauth server client model represents the credentials of a client application there are two pairs the client identifier and secret which the client uses to identify itself to the authorization server and the display name and url which the client uses to identify itself to the end user the client application is not tied to a single client record specifically if the client credentials are compromised you ll want to revoke it and create a new client with new pair of identifier and secret you can leave the revoked instance around calling revoke on the client revokes access using these credential pair and also revokes any outstanding authorization requests access grants and access tokens created using these credentials you may also want to register a redirect uri if registered the client is only able to request authorization that redirect back to that redirect uri the authorization process may involve multiple requests and the application must maintain the authorization request details from beginning to end to keep the application simple all the necessary information for a single authorization request is stored in the rack oauth server authrequest model the application only needs to keep track of the authorization request identifier granting an authorization request by calling grant creates an access grant or access token depending on the requested response type and associates it with the identity an access grant rack oauth server accessgrant is a nonce use to generate access token this model keeps track of the nonce the authorization code and all the data it needs to create an access token an access token allows the client to access the resource with the given scope on behalf of a given identity it keeps track of the account identifier supplied by the application  client identifier and scope both supplied by the an rack oauth server accesstoken is created by copying values from an authrequest or accessgrant  and remains in effect until revoked oauth   access tokens can also expire rack oauth server accesstoken has expiresat field an issuer is a identity provider which issues assertions that may be used to obtain an access

15209160, promises are a great solution to address complexities of asynchronous requests and responses angularjs provides promises using services such as q and http other services also use promises but i will not discuss those here promises allow developers to easily attach x only notifications of response to any asynchronous request and action promises also enable two  other very important things we can transform the responses before subsequent handlers in the chain are notified of the response use the response to invoke more async requests which could generate more promises but even more important than the features above promises support easy chaining of custom activity or computations managing sequences or chains of asynchronous activity can be a very difficult and complex effort promise chains are amazing and provide means to easily build sequences of asynchronous requests or asynchronous activity and we will also discuss the some of hidden anti patterns below i explore and discuss the hidden power in chain promises or your can simply watch the egghead io video tutorial consider the travel service shown which loads information about the user s upcoming travel departure below our service shows how a a remote web service by returns a json data file remember that data calls are asynchronous and our travelservice request generates a promise to respond when the information is loaded javascript var travelservice function http return getdeparture function user return http get urllastflight userid user email now let s use this service from a flightdashboard to load the user s scheduled flight javascript var flightdashboard function scope user travelservice travelservice getdeparture user then function departure and and publish the departure details to the view scope departure departure scope departure null okay this is nice but nothing shockingly new is shown here so let s add some real world complexity now let s assume that once we have flight details then we will also want to check the weather forecast and the flight status the scenario here is a cascaded  call sequence getdeparture getflight getforecast javascript var flightdashboard function scope user travelservice weatherservice and and level  travelservice getdeparture user email and and request  then function departure and and response handler   scope departure departure and and level  travelservice getflight departure flightid and and request  then function flight and and response handler   scope flight flight and and level  weatherservice getforecast departure date and and request  then function weather and and response handler   scope weather weather    notice how the success handler for getflight is passed the flight object and the success handler for getforecast is passed the weather object both of which are published to the scope the above implementation uses deep nesting to create a sequential cascading chain of three  asynchronous requests requests to load the user s departure flight information and weather forecast note that the code shown above does not handle errors and any nested rejections will not be propagated properly while this works deep nesting can quickly become difficult to manage if each level has non trivial logic promise chain nesting also requires developers to careful consider how they will manage errors within the chain segments i personally consider deep nesting to be an anti pattern fortunately we can restructure the code for errors clarity and maintenance here we leverage the fact that a promise handler can return a value that will be delivered to subsequent resolve handlers a promise that will create a branch queue of async activity a exception to reject subsequent promise activity a rejected promise to propagate rejections to subsequent handlers since promise handlers can return promises  let s use that technique to refactor a new implementation javascript var flightdashboard function scope user flightservice weatherservice travelservice getdeparture user and and request  then function departure  scope departure departure and and response handler  return travelservice getflight departure flightid and and request   then function flight  scope flight flight and and response handler  return weatherservice getforecast scope departure date and and request   then function weather  scope weather weather and and response handler   scope flight null scope planstatus null scope forecast null the important change here is to notice that the response handler returns a promise see how the handler for getdeparture returns a promise for getflight and the success handler for getflight which returns a promise for getforecast remember that success handlers can either a return the response value b throw an exception or c return a promise this is a good example of a flattened promise chain approach but i do not like this solution because i had to create my success handlers as function wrappers that essentially only call another promise returning api it would be great if i could eliminate those tedious function wrappers which seem like an unnecessary extra layers this is also manifest at least two other anti patterns we modified a scope variable at each level instead of a single pass modification of all three  scope variables getforecast call references scope departure date instead of an argument passed reference what else can we do what if we viewed each request response as a self contained process then we could chain processes javascript var flightdashboard function scope user travelservice weatherservice  var loaddeparture function user  return travelservice getdeparture user email and and request  then function departure  scope departure departure and and response handler  return departure flightid   loadflight function flightid  return travelservice getflight flightid and and request  then function flight  scope flight flight and and response handler  return flight   loadforecast function  return weatherservice getforecast scope departure date and and request  then function weather  scope weather weather and and response handler  return weather   and and  easy steps to load all of our information loaddeparture user then loadflight then loadforecast scope user user scope departure null scope flight null scope weather null  now we have three  intuitively named functions loaddeparture  loadflight  and loadforecast  all chained together in a flat chain each segment of the chain is now a self contained named function javascript loaddeparture user then loadflight then loadforecast each of these functions internally makes a service call gets a promise and attaches a success handler to the promise and each handler publishes something to the scope but two other very important things are now happening  returning promises instead of data objects notice that each of the chain segments loaddeparture loadflight loadweather returns a promise the important thing to realize here is the instead of returning a data object we are returning another promise returning promises allows use to build chains where each segment is only resolved when the promise at the segment resolves and that promise could itself represent a subchain while a segment is waiting for its promise to resolve or reject all the remaining segments in the chain are waiting and in fact those segments have not even been called yet the async requests in subsequent segments are queued and have not even been called yet this is promise chaining this is very powerful  success handlers return data values notice that the internal promise success handler of each segment returns a value a value that may be passed as an argument value when invoking the next segment of the promise chain see how the first segment loaddeparture returns the flightid  which is passed as an argument when invoking the call to loadflight and while loadflight returns the flight object the next segment loadweather ignores that value this flattened promise chain is now really easy to understand and manage an anti pattern issue still exists here this solution has that one  funky hack notice how the weather service had to use scope departure date within its getforecast call loadweatherforecast can only directly receive a flight argument and it does not have direct access to the flight reference finally we should consider the dependencies of each segment of the chain notice that not all of our requests have to be sequential and thus wait for all previous segments to finish first in our scenario the flight and weather service calls could be requested in parallel independent of each other we will use the q all and the q spread methods to condense our code and centralize all scope changes javascript var flightdashboard function scope user travelservice weatherservice q log var loadflight function user  return travelservice getdeparture user email and and request   parallelload function departure  and and execute   in parallel return q all travelservice getflight departure flightid  and and request  weatherservice getforecast departure date and and request   then q spread function flight weather  scope departure departure and and response handler  scope flight flight and and response handler  scope weather weather and and response handler  and and let s force an error to demonstrate the reportproblem works throw new error just to prove catch works   reportproblems function fault  log error string fault  and and  easy steps to load all of our information and and and now we can include logging for of problems within any of the steps loadflight user then parallelload catch reportproblems the last version is very clean and terse i simplified even further and i also added a exception handler open chrome developer tools and you can breakpoint and step thru the logic and code base hopefully i have shown you some elegant and sophisticated techniques for chaining promises the above chain can easily become even more complicated but even these complicated chains are easy to manage with the techniques that i have demonstrated you will have to decide whether you want to nest or flatten your promise chains just note that all of these approaches are simply techniques of chaining functions that either request more asynchronous activity or handle their async responses

interesting stuff happens in cgp py circuits py is used to communicate with ngspice plotting py is used to implement plotting with matplotlib when running with pypy getch py gets a single character from output work is currently in progress and documentation is missing this is currently hard to use and requires a knowledge of how to use spice simulation can be stopped with a keyboard interrupt progress is saved after every generation and can be continued by just running the script again current stable release whichever you want git release often has performance improvements and possibly new features but it also comes with the best bugs if you are new to using spice it might be better to install latest stable version as of    this is version  compile and install ngspice with following commands mkdir release cd release and configure enable xspice disable debug make sudo make install the program is used by saving simulation settings in separate file and running it with command pypy cgp py filename see examples folder for example scripts using pypy is necessary cpython raises picklingerror because it can t pickle functions inside classes which is required for multithreading every name starting with underscore  is ignored by cgp py and they can be used for internal functions in settings file required settings are title title of the simulation this will be the name of the folder where output is placed max parts maximum number of devices allowed spice commands spice simulation commands can be string if there is only one simulation or list of string for more than one simulation parts a dictionary of available parts fitness function the goal function that circuits are ranked against optional settings are common common constructs in spice simulation eg input resistance output load models string of spice models constraints one function or a list of functions for constraints some entries in list can be none length of list must equal the number of spice simulations population number of circuits in one generation default is  nodes number of nodes where parts can be attached default is same as max parts elitism number of circuits copied straight into a new generation default is mutation rate probability of mutations default is   crossover rate probability of crossovers default is   fitness weight weightings for fitness functions can be either numbers or functions of type lambda x kwargs  where x is simulation x axis value kwargs has keys extra value  generation  possibly more as they are added list of dictionaries one list elements corresponds to one spice simulation dictionary keys are measurements v n  i n  and values are the weights the measurement is multiplied value can also be a function that takes input value and returns a number extra value list of tuples that are minimum and maximum of extra values that chromosome can hold this is returned to fitness function as argument extra value this can be used as example for transition voltage of an inverter log file filename where simulation log is saved plot titles list of dictionaries of plot titles plot yrange list of dictionaries of plot y axis ranges can be useful if you turn the output plots into an animation this avoids the rescaling of the selection weight higher values make better performing circuits being picked more often and smaller values make selection more fair   makes selection completely random default is   and values should be bigger than zero usable range us probably from   to   don t set this too high or entropy in the gene pool is lost and genetic algorithm doesn t converge you should only touch this if you know what you are doing constraint weight weights for constraints similar to fitness weight score added is percentage of values not passing times this score max mutations maximum number of mutations without re evaluating the fitness function constraint free generations number of generations before constraint functions are enabled gradual constraints apply constraint function scores gradually default is constraint ramp number of generations before constraint scores are at maximum levels does nothing if gradual constraints if false random circuits percentage of random circuits in new generation default is    plot every generation true to plot every generation even if the best score is same or worse than the last generation useful is weights increase when current generation increases doesn t need to be enabled for gradual constraints to work properly default is false default scoring use default scoring squared error difference and weighting custom scoring user defined scoring function none if none is given both user defined and default scoring can be active at the same time in this case scores are summed function should take two arguments result and kwargs result is dictionary of measurements each dictionary value is tuple of two lists simulation x axis and y axis values example v n          should return a score that has a type of float timeout spice simulation default timeout this is raised automatically if default is too low seed seed circuits to be added in the first generation all of the devices need to be in the parts dictionary can be a list or string seed copies copies of seed circuits first you need to decide what components you want to allow and add them to the parts dictionary the dictionary key is the name of component in spice and the value should be an another dictionary with contents nodes number of leads in the component value true and false component has a value example true for resistors and capacitors their values are resistance and capacitance false for example transistors min exponent of the components minimum value minimum value will be  min max exponent of the components maximum value spice extra options for spice this is appended to the end of components description in spice this is used for example transistors model next you need spice simulation commands and a optional part models ground node is hard coded in spice to be  add print value eg print v n or print i n in the spice commands to get an output to the program you can print more than one measurement from one spice simulation other settings you should specify are the fitness function or a list of them if you have more than one simulation these are the goals of the evolution that circuits are scored against definition of the fitness function is def fitness function ab kwargs first argument is the input value of the measurement eg voltage current decibels phase second is the name of the spice measurement eg v n  vdb n  i vin kwargs has the optional extra value of the chromosome and the current generation for example a constant fitness function def goal vk kwargs v is input either voltage frequency time depends on spice simulation k is the name of node being measured return  another fitness function a spice simulation with more than one measurement and example use of kwargs this example has a current and voltage measurements def goal vk kwargs if k  v voltage return kwargs extravalue  v elif k  i current return e  if kwargs generation  else  discontinuous fitness function that is  before time is ns and  after it def goal tk kwargs t is now time return  if t e  else  fitness weights are either constants that scores are multiplied with or functions that individual values of spice simulation are weighted with if you want to for example weight some part of the results higher than other parts they should be in list of dictionaries where number of elements in list is same as number of spice simulations the nth element is used with nth spice simulation keys of the dictionaries are names of measurements eg v n and values are for example a constants weights with  simulations with second one having two measurements fitnessweight v n   v n  i vin   v n   v n   see examples folder for examples due to the rapid development examples might not always work but i try my best to keep them up to date

12559993, mtlog an nslog replacement for coders logging is essential part of debugging and i was often irritated that nslog is not as flexible as i d like it to be therefore i came around writing mtlog the flexible logging tool that i need  including mtlog in your project   copy the mtlog sub folder into your xcode project  import mtlog h in the project pch file to have mtlog working throughout all your classes  in your project s podfile add the mtlog pod pod mtlog  from the terminal inside the project folder run pod install  import mtlog h in the project pch file to have mtlog working throughout all your classes  using mtlog  mtlog works by adding scripting abilities to your log messages you use nslog as normally but you can include certain commands or add your own commands that will be executed in the text of your log messages it s best if you just read through the examples below nb always make sure you ve imported mtlog h by default fresh mtlog instances come with a default prefix for your messages the default prefix includes the file name of the current class and the current line number example output below nslog my log message myclass m  gt my log message if you want a different prefix than the default you can use the prefix command to change it nslog prefix set method line my log message nslog my second message mymethod  gt my log message mymethod  gt my second message nb prefix set  sets the prefix for the current log message and for all the messages you log afterwards besides text you can also use variables in your prefix that will get replaced with their values for every log message here s the list of available variables table width  the name of the current file the current class name the current method name the current line number a counter starting from  it increases every time you log from the same line in the same file if you don t want a special prefix to your log messages just call set with no arguments nslog prefix set if you want to change the prefix for the current log message only you use prefix use  nslog my log message nslog prefix use method line my log message nslog my second message myclass m  gt my log message mymethod  gt my log message myclass m  gt my second message if you change the prefix and want to go back to the default pass the default constant to the set method of the prefix command nslog prefix set default you can use the filter command to temporarily filter the log output i e if you are debugging a certain method at the moment you don t want to see the output of all other log statements outside this method until you are finished you can use filter in several different ways if you pass a file name to filter after this log statement you will see only the output from this file yourclass m and void message nslog your message myclass m nslog filter myclass m nslog my message yourclass message myclass m  gt my message and and your message will be filtered and not show up in the output console you can filter the output by line number pass in a file name to filter and as arguments provide the range of lines that should generate output to the console nslog filter myclass m  this command will allow only log statements from the lines between line  and line  to generate output to the console you can also pass a method signature to the filter command then it will allow output only from the method matching this signature filter commands you can stack up i e you want to see only the output from the init method though you have an init method in each of your classes you can combine a filter by file name and a filter by method name nslog filter myclass m nslog filter init after this nslog statements only logging from init in myclass m will generate output sometimes you want to see the output only of a certain line in your code and nothing more for example if the nslog statement is in a for loop nslog begin counting for int i  i  i and and nslog filter this i i  i nslog more loop output nslog filter this loop ended nslog last log message once you use filter this all log messages afterwards get filtered out except for the ones that also use filter this the output of the code above is myclass m  begin counting myclass m  i  myclass m  i  myclass m  i  myclass m  loop ended since commands like filter affect all log messages afterwards you need a way to also deactivate them use remove followed by the exact command you used in first place if we take the example from above and combine it with remove the code could look like this nslog filter this message  nslog message  nslog remove filter this and and remove and the command including arguments nslog message  since the remove command will remove the filter you will also see the last log in the output console myclass m  message  myclass m  message  in general all commands affect all logs after they get executed therefore you need to use remove to deactivate them some commands like prefix use  are one shot commands therefore you don t need to use remove for them the route command allows you to clone the output you see in the console to a log file that s handy if you d like to run the app many times and then analyze the log contents for example the command creates a log txt in your app s documents folder and saves all the output while the command is active to this file if you pass in a full blown path to a file the command will create or overwrite it at the location you specify if you pass the append constant as a second parameter your app will keep adding content to the file instead of overwriting it at every run bool application uiapplication application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions nsdictionary launchoptions nslog message one nslog message two return yes       and  new log entry application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions  message one application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions  message two       and  new log entry application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions  message one application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions  message two sometimes there s so much output in the console that you can t find the one line you really want to see and further it s difficult to find where in the code is the line that produces that output and break there the search command helps you spot certain log messages this command simply adds  empty lines before every line that contains the search term it kind of clears the console when the search term appears so you can spot it easier nslog search clear vacation nslog yupee nslog i m going on vacation myclass m  yupee  and and  more empty lines myclass m  i m going on vacation whenever the search term appears in a log message the app throws an exception and catches it so the execution is not interrupted if you are having a breakpoint for all exceptions xcode will break inside the search plugin so you can debug your code up the stack now comes the best of all commands the one that allows you to register new commands with mtlog have an idea for a command that will really help you while debuggin add it you need to subclass mtlogplugin and override some or all of the following methods in the order of invocation and and to tell mtlog how many arguments you are expecting and and for example return  for zero one or two args and nsrange expectednumberofargumentsforcommand nsstring command and and the custom plugin init name contains the command value is the part after the colon and and args is an array of the arguments not trimmed of spaces instancetype initwithname nsstring name value nsstring value args nsarray args and and the method is invoked just before the plugin is added to enabled plugins list void willenableforlog mtlog log and and text contains the log message you can alter it in any way and return it and and look up env below nsstring preprocesslogmessage nsstring text env nsarray env and and use this method to react to a command after the message is logged and and look up env below void postprocesslogmessage nsstring text env nsarray env the env array contains as follows  file name  class name  method name  line number  list of all enabled plugins  list of all registered plugins you can alter the enabled and registered plugins lists if you need to let s see the code for a new command called smilie that adds a smilie to each log message pluginsmilie h interface pluginsmilie mtlogplugin pluginsmilie m

arguments for the smilie classic command then in preprocesslogmessage env you add a smilie to the text argument which alters the message being logged let s see how you can use the new command in your

magical tool to generate new rails and modify existing rails applications coming to include your favourite powerful magic authentication testing persistence javascript css deployment and templating there s a magical scroll for you follow on twitter appscrolls  installation is simple gem install appscrolls the primary usage of the appscrolls gem is to utilize its interactive terminal command to build a new rails application to get started you can simply run the command thusly appscrolls new appname scrolls new appname where appname is the directory in which you wish to create the app it mirrors the rails creation syntax you will then be guided through the scroll selection process and subsequently the rails app generator will automatically run with the template and all appropriate command line options included to transform an existing rails app you wait that s not implemented yet but since the apply template feature of rails new appname m template rb is implemented in thor i mean how hard could it be the current available scrolls grouped by category administration activeadmin railsadmin assets jquery prototype deployment eycloud eycloudrecipesondeploy git github passenger thin unicorn persistence mysql postgresql redis sqlite stylesheet twitterbootstrap templating simpleform testing capybara cucumber rspec testunit worker delayedjob resque other envyaml guard railsbasics split if you wish to skip the interactive scroll selector you may provide instead a list of scrolls with the s or scrolls option scrolls new appname s twitterbootstrap mysql resque scrolls new appname scrolls postgresql github eycloud this will automatically generate a rails template with the provided scrolls and begin the app generator you can also print out a simple list of scrolls scrolls list or print out a list of scrolls for a specific category scrolls list persistence web applications are boring if they aren t running proudly on the internet the app scrolls make this automatic for your favourite providers scroll eycloud scrolls new mydemoapp s twitterbootstrap unicorn postgresql resque github eycloud the created application above will be automatically stored in a git private and public repository on github and then deployed to engine yard cloud  when deploying to engine yard cloud  you will need to choose unicorn or passenger for your app server mysql or postgresql for your sql db when choosing from the following scrolls your engine yard cloud environment will be automatically upgraded and configured with chef recipes resque add utility instances called resque for workers see readme  for more information redis add a utility called redis to have a dedicated redis db else it is run on your db master or solo instance delayedjob add utility instances called delayedjob or dj for workers see readme  for more information note resque is recommended instead of delayed job soon sidekiq will be recommended over both and please open an issue if you want an alternate option puma or thin or mongodb the app scrolls needs a heroku master to support heroku for the app scrolls there is some initial work in the current scrolls  and the archived and unsupported scrolls  the app scrolls needs a cloudfoundry master to support cloudfoundry for the app scrolls create new scrolls using thor new scroll name submitting a scroll is actually a very straightforward process scrolls are made of up template code and yaml back matter stored in a ruby file the end parsing convention is used so that each scroll is actually a valid parseable ruby file the structure of a scroll looks something like this gem supergem afterbundler do generate supergem install category templating name supergem description installs supergem which is useful for things author mbleigh it s really that simple the gem has rspec tests that automatically validate each scroll in the repository so you should run rake spec as a basic sanity check before submitting a pull request note that these don t verify that your scroll code itself works just that app scrolls could properly parse and understand your scroll file this project is an old fashioned fork of michael bleigh  s rails wizard  a new name new project and new purpose this project wouldn t exist without michael having created rails wizard  during rails rumble and maintaining and upgrading it for a long time sadly support dropped off several recipes did not work with rails   and  dr nic  originally worked on rails wizard  to provide engine yard cloud  support his employer and his favourite hosting platform he also merged in a lot of recipes from other forks and added new recipes for modern projects support for engine yard cloud meant integration with chef recipes this meant confusing language rails wizard recipes and chef recipes he decided that wizards don t use recipes they use scrolls alchemists use recipes and screw alchemists and their dinky potions recipes became scrolls automatically setup continuous integration for new applications branches jenkins interactive mode is a wizard by categories pick a b c or none apply scrolls to existing rails applications branch applyscrolls  scrolls work or fail fast on heroku scrolls work or fail fast on cloudfoundry scrolls generate their own readme branch readmes rd party services and add ons enabled within deployment platform or directly with service padrino and sinatra applications non ruby applications lithium for php etc missing scrolls mongodb branch mongodb omniauth branch omniauth sidekiq branch sidekiq how hard could it be how hard could it be to transform applications pretty hard scrolls need to be aware of the current code base rather than merely the list of other scrolls being used to create a new app scrolls also need to know about versions of rails rather than just latest rails app scrolls and its scrolls are distributed under the mit license see mitlicense  for the actual words

com and freels and tablemigrator git tablemigrator is a method for altering large mysql tables while incurring as little downtime as possible there is nothing special about alter table all it does is create a new table with the new schema and copy over each row from the original table oh and it does this in a big giant table lock so you won t be using that big table for a while tablemigrator does essentially the same thing but more intelligently first we create a new table like the original one and then apply one or more alter table statements to the unused empty table second we copy all rows from the original table into the new one all this time reads and writes are going to the original table so the two tables are not consistent finally we acquire a write lock on the original table before copying over all new and changed rows and swapping in the new table the solution to find updated or new rows is to use a column like updatedat if a row is mutable or createdat if it is immutable to determine which rows have been modified since the copy started these rows are copied over to the new table using replace if we do a single sweep of changed rows you set multipass to false  then a write lock is acquired before the sweep new and changed rows are copied to the new table the tables are swapped and then the lock is released the default method multipass true copies over changed rows in a non blocking manner multiple times until we can be reasonably sure that the final sweep will take very little time the last sweep is done within the write lock and then the tables are swapped the length of time taken in the write lock is extremely short hence the claim zero downtime migration the key to making these sweeps for changes fast is to have an index on the column used to find them having an index on the relevant column makes this process fast without that index tablemigrator eventually has to do a table scan within the final synchronous sweep and that means downtime will be unavoidable this method will not propagate normal deletes s to the new table if they happen during and after the copy in order to avoid this use paranoid deletion and update the column you are using to find changes appropriately tablemigrator supports two apis for defining migrations one uses activerecord s changetable syntax and the other uses manually defined sql snippets you can create your migration by inheriting from tablemigration and skip some of the setup normally required using changetable class addstufftomybigtable tablemigration migrates users migrates also can take an options hash multipass see explanation above defaults to true migrationname the original table is not dropped after the migration it will instead have a name based on this option the default is based on the migration class the old table will end up named usersbeforeaddstufftomybigtable in this case createtemptable performs the migration in two steps if false read below for details defaults to true dryrun if true the migration will not actually run just emit fake progress to the log defaults to false changetable do and t and t integer foo null false default  t string bar t index foo name indexforfoo end using raw sql class addstufftomybigtable tablemigration migrates users push alter tables to schemachanges schemachanges push sql alter table newtablename add column foo int  unsigned not null default  sql schemachanges push sql alter table newtablename add column bar varchar  sql schemachanges push sql alter table newtablename add index indexfoo foo sql some helpers are provided tablemigrator access to the tablemigrator instance being configured columnnames defaults to an array of the original table s columns quotedcolumnnames the above with each quoted in back ticks you can also customize the base copy query by setting it to an insert statement with no conditions the default is based on columnnames above tablename and newtablename are replaced with the original table and new table names respectively insert is substituted for replace after the initial bulk copy tablemigrator basecopyquery sql insert into newtablename columnnames join  select columnnames join  from tablename sql you can use a normal activerecord migration you just have to set up a tablemigrator instance yourself otherwise it works the same as above class addstufftomybigtable activerecord migration just a helper method so we don t have to repeat this in self up and self down def self setup create a new tablemigrator instance for the table users tablemigrator initialize takes the same arguments as migrates tm tablemigrator new users migrationname addstuff  multipass true createtemptable true default dryrun false  push alter tables to schemachanges tm schemachanges push sql alter table newtablename add column foo int  unsigned not null default  sql tm schemachanges push sql alter table newtablename add column bar varchar  sql tm schemachanges push sql alter table newtablename add index indexfoo foo sql customizing tm columnnames tm columnnames w id name session passwordhash createdat updatedat for convenience columnlist tm quotedcolumnnames join  the base insert query with no wheres we ll take care of that part tm basecopyquery sql insert into newtablename columnlist select columnlist from tablename sql end def self up self setup tm up end def self down self setup tm down end see two phase migration below def self createtableandcopyinfo self setup tm createtableandcopyinfo end you can run the migration in two phases if you set the createtemptable option to false first you deploy the code with the migration and manually run the createtableandcopyinfo method if you use a tablemigration sublcass require db and migrate and mymigration rb now time now mymigration createtableandcopyinfo puts nextepoch now nextepoch tue feb       this creates the temporary table copies the data over without locking anything you can safely run this without halting your application finally you put up whatever downtime notices you have and run your typical migration task since the table is already created the script will only copy data if multipass is enabled and perform the actual table move it assumes the temporary table has been created already nextepoch tue feb       railsenv production rake db migrate matt freels rohith ravi rick olson copyright c

available the log and watch options the log option when enabled will output all status messages by default this is enabled the watch option when enabled will allow buildr to run in the background watching for changes in our srcpath  if a change is detected then our project is automatically rebuilt for us by default this is disabled there are two handlers you can configure they are the buildhandler and the rebuildhandler the buildhandler is fired after our project has been built the rebuildhandler is fired after our project has been rebuilt our project is rebuilt when we utilise the watch true config option which scans for changes in the background and automatically rebuilds our project on change if this isn t specified then the buildhandler will automatically be used as the rebuildhandler they are both passed a single argument called err which is either an error instance or false if no error occurred they both also have default values so you don t need to specify them if you don t want to to pass your scripts through jshint and your styles through csslint you d want the following configuration coffeescript srcpath src string checking checkscripts true array or true or

3249576, apparat is a framework to work with abc swc and swf files you can use the core framework to build scripted applications that modify the content of a swf file or use any of the predefined available tools all tools will show their usage information if you omit any parameters apparat tries to make use of an advanced compression with  zip if apparat can find  zip on your path it will use it to compress your content to test if  zip is available you should simply enter z on windows or za on linux and os x in the command line apparat shell the shell is a tool to spawn apparat only once and keep it running since it is a java application you will save jvm startup time and the overhead to allocate threadpools when running apparat the shell has been created to work asynchronous with multiple requests so any number of applications and requests can run simoultaneously all predefined tools can be executed from the shell just like from the command line concrete the concrete tool allows you to speficy abstract methods and check at compile time if they are overriden to mark a method abstract you add the abstract metadata to it when compiling your project you need to keep this metadata this is done by specifying keep as metadata abstract as a compiler argument concrete takes one parameter i which is the list of input files you will need to include all swc or swf files that have been used to compile this project this means even for a simple project you have to specify playerglobal swc for instance since it is used to compile your project to seperate multiple libraries use your systems path separator character this is on windows machines and on mac os x or linux example windows concrete i test swf c path to playerglobal swc example linux and os x concrete i test swf and path and to and playerglobal swc coverage with the coverage tool you can insert coverage information into your code apparat assumes that a class apparat coverage coverage exists or is provided at runtime an example of the coverage class can look like this package apparat coverage public final class coverage public static function onsample file string line int void trace touched line  line in  file to run coverage you specify an input file with the i parameter and an optional output file with the o parameter you can add multiple source paths in the s parameter the tool will instrument only files that are also on the source path like the concrete tool you can chain multiple paths with the path separator of your operating system example coverage i input swf o output swf s c path to as source this tool can be used to generate detailed information of a given file specify the input with the i parameter an optional directory can be given with the o parameter dump will output all files in this directory which is by default the directory of the given input file if you speficy the swf parameter the tag information of the file is exported if you speficy the uml parameter a uml graph for the given file is generated in dot format this format can be opened with omnigraffle in os x or you can transform it to an image or svg with graphviz if you spefiy the abc parameter dump will output detailed abc information if abc is specified you can also change the way how methods are written bc raw will show raw bytes bc cfg will output methods a s control flow graphs in dot format bc default will use apparat s default bytecode representation reducer you can use reducer for advanced compression of your swf files reducer tries to compress embedded png graphics you can leverage this option also with the actionscript compiler the compress parameter and let reducer do the job since it makes use of multicore architectures i specifies the input file o an optional output file q specifies the jpeg compression level q   is maximum quality q   is minimum quality you will get also good compression results for q   d speficies the strength of the flash players internal deblocking filter example reducer i input swf o output swf q   stripper this tool removes all debug information from a swf file it is a type safe removal keeping side effects this means a loop like this while iter hasnext trace iter next would be rewritten like while iter hasnext iter next stripper removes also all debug releated bytecode example stripper i input swf o output swf stripper i inputandoutput swc turbo diesel sport injection the tdsi tool performs various bytecode transformations besides specific transformations the application will always try to do certain peephole optimizations most of them will fix problems with older actionscript compiler versions f true and false if you specify the f argument tdsi will try to fix certain problems with files generated by the alchemy compiler this transformation will only affect code generated from c and c and and sources this option defaults to false the best way to optimize an alchemy file with tdsi is by calling tdsi i input swc o output swc f true a false e false m false this transformation is by default turned off a true and false this option will inline alchemy operations from actionscript if you use the memory class provided by the apparat ersatz library those operations will be replaced with fast alchemy this transformation is by default turned on e true and false perform inline expansion if your class extends the apparat inline inline class all its static methods will be inlined when called those methods may not contain exceptions and must be static this transformation is by default turned on m true and false whether or not to enable macro expansion macros are like a type safe copy and paste that happens at compile time more information is available here example perform alchemy  inline and macroexpansion tdsi i

4040531, the only thing you need is ssh access and a supported os at this time only ubuntu is supported you can skip this if you already know about capistrano and chef installing servers can be tedious work keeping your configuration in sync can be hard too chef is an excellent tool for managing this it can provision your server from scratch it can also be run again and again to check and update your configuration if needed capistrano is an excellent tool for deployment it can deploy your code on multiple machines with clever defaults limited downtime and the ability to quickly roll back your deployment if something has gone wrong roundsman aims to integrate capistrano and chef this means that with every deploy it can check and update your configuration if needed are you using a new version of ruby in your next release it will automatically install when you deploy adding a new machine to your cluster no problem roundsman will go from a bare bones linux machine to a working server in minutes before you can use roundsman you need to know how to use capistrano and how to write chef recipes here are some resources you might want to check out feeling comfortable you can tackle deploying your application with capistrano and chef now you can use roundsman to combine them roundsman runs on ruby    and above if you re using bundler you can add roundsman to your gemfile gem roundsman  require false run bundle install to get it if you re not using bundler you can install roundsman by hand gem install roundsman and capify your project capify next load roundsman in capfile require roundsman and capistrano by default roundsman assumes you put your chef cookbooks inside config and cookbooks if you don t like this see the configuration configuration chapter but here we re going to use that i m also going to assume that you put all capistano configuration inside config and deploy rb when you have a lot of configuration or use the multistage extension you might want to place it elsewhere after configuring capistrano and writing and downloading chef recipes you can hook them up with a capistrano hook simply provide provide a run list let s say you want to run the default recipe of your own cookbook called main before deploy updatecode do roundsman runlist recipe main i m hooking it up before the updatecode command and not before deploy so it will also run when running cap deploy migrations setting up a webserver usually requires that you have the code already there otherwise restarting nginx or apache will fail because it cannot find your application yet to remedy that you can make another recipe that will configure your webserver and have it run after deploying your new code after deploy createsymlink do roundsman runlist recipe main webserver if you want a recipe to only run on a specific role you can do so like this namespace install do task postgres roles db do roundsman runlist recipe main postgres before deploy updatecode  install postgres by default roundsman will make a lot of capistrano s configuration available to chef so you might have these settings set application my awesome blog set railsenv production set deployto and var and www and application railsenv set user deployer here s how you can use them inside your recipes directory file join node deployto  uploads do owner node user owner node user recursive true every configuration option from capistrano is available in chef if your using cookbook for example you can set the attributes like this set passenger version     maxpoolsize  there are also a set of configuration options for roundsman itself they all have sensible defaults but you can override them if needed to read all the default configuration cap roundsman configuration you can also perform a lot of tasks by hand if you need to here s how to get information cap tasks roundsman to get more information use the explain flag and specify a task name like cap explain roundsman installruby what roundsman does is this it will determine if you have the right version of ruby installed your machine might already have an older version of ruby installed so if it needs to it version of ruby you need for your application then it will install check the version of chef solo and install or upgrade as it will then copy over the cookbooks from your local machine to your deployment machine this means that you don t need to commit every change while you re still working on it it will create your node json file based upon your capistrano configuration and run the recipes needed this is all done in capistrano hooks using capistrano methods like run  so you can determine when and how your recipes are run capistrano and chef both give a lot of output check out to colorize your output for better readability if you want to test out your configuration locally you should take a look at can even create a stage just for vagrant with the capistrano multistage extension if you want to help out please create an issue or do a pull request and i will take a look at it to get this project up and running make sure you have virtualbox because we use vagrant then all you need to do is bundle install

4961712, throttle is a simple node js app that allows you to simulate poor network connections e g like a cellular connection so you can test how your websites will perform for example testing a responsive website on a poor g connection without actually having to have a poor g connection to use throttle simply connect your mac to ethernet share that network connection via airport turn on throttle and any device connected to that wifi access point will then be throttled to the the network speed you specify via a web frontend if you don t have node js on your computer don t fret it s very easy to install so you can get throttle up and running quickly it s important to note that throttle was designed to be used in conjunction with a device lab and products like shim or adobe edge inspect where a shared connection is expected that has definitely influenced its design and test cases throttle has some very simple features web based app so it can be accessed updated from any connected device or computer modify download network speeds for connected devices modify upload network speeds for connected devices modify the latency or delay in the network connection for connected devices use presets to quickly switch between network types the machine throttle is installed on and devices connect through still has a full speed internet connection throttle requires the following a mac running mac os x   x or   x a mac with both ethernet and wifi ports so probably won t work with a macbook air node js v  and i highly encourage you to stay away from  bit only macs as your throttle platform installing throttle requires modifying several different parts of your mac  at command prompt type sudo visudo  enter in your administrator password  using the arrow key scroll to the bottom type i  hit a carriage return so you have a new line and then type your username all nopasswd and sbin and ipfw  hit esc and then wq run the following commands from the command line  git clone git and and github com and dmolsen and throttle git  cd throttle  npm install express  npm install jade  node app js you should now have throttle running on port  if the node command was unrecognized try and usr and local and bin and node app js for step  turn on internet sharing so your mobile devices can connect to your mac as a wifi access point  open settings sharing  select the internet sharing option  select ethernet from the share your connection from dropdown  mark the checkbox next to airport  mark the checkbox next to internet sharing confirm you want to run it any device that uses that wifi access point will now be throttled based on the options you choose when you configure network performance via throttle s admin  open settings network  note the ip address that s listed will be something like   x x or   x x you should now see the throttle admin page as long as any designers or developers connect to the new wifi access point they should be able to enter in the xip io address and change the settings to use adobe edge inspect with throttle simply make sure all of your devices and your desktop machine are connected to the wifi point from the mac throttle is running on note that any latency or other options but especially latency will affect the speed of adobe edge inspect i ll need to look into that

6106867, in idiomatic clojure data is not hidden behind classes and methods but instead left lying around in a homogenous heap of stuff assumptions about the shape of stuff are implicitly encoded in the functions used to operate on it when your stuff is the wrong shape things blow up far down the line in an unhelpful fashion clojure defn f keys x y as z x y z f x  y    x  y  nil nil nil f list     nil nil     strucjure is a library for describing stuff in an executable manner it gives you pattern matching with first class patterns  validators parsers walks and lenses and eventually generators the shape of your data is immediately apparent from your code and errors are clearly reported clojure require strucjure sugar as s refer  defn g input s and match input z s and keys x y x y z g x  y

equivalent idiomatic clojure code clojure a  b  a  b   ns let keys a b a  b  and a  b   ns really match a  b  a  b  ok  ns binding variables in a match is currently expensive relative to normal clojure destructuring due to using proteus container  to fake mutable variables clojure let keys a b a  b   ns s and match a  b  s and keys a b a b  ns other performance disparities are less clear clojure defn f pairs if let x y more pairs cons clojure core and and x y f more nil f range    us defn g pairs match pairs x  y  more  cons clojure core and and x y g more nil g range    us defn h pairs match pairs letp p case x  y  p cons clojure core and and x y p nil p h range    s nethertheless there is no reason why pattern matching shouldn t eventually be faster especially since they allow complex parsing with only a single pass over the input data distributed under the gnu lesser general public license

1938079, photoapplink  we are sorry to announce that photoapplink is being phased out  photoapplink will still continue to work in supported apps on ios  and earlier until the end of the year when we will stop serving the server side plist however we will not accept any new applications any more   photoapplink is an open source library allowing your ios photo app to launch other participating photo apps while passing along the current image this will allow users to easily process an image using a combination of multiple photo apps without having to save intermediate images to the camera roll quitting one app launching the next loading up the intermediate image instead the user simply selects a send to app option which presents all compatible apps in a nice interface the selected app is then launched and the current image is passed along so that the user can keep editing it in that app immediately this provides a more fluid user interface to the user and encourages the use of compatible apps the library manages the discovery of compatible apps installed on the user s device furthermore it also provides a nice user interface for discovering and purchasing additional compatible apps this will provide promotion of your app through other compatible apps and will also give you another revenue source through the use of linkshare links that is if a user buys a compatible app discovered through photoapplink in your app then you will get the commission for the sale how it works under the hood  to enable this image exchange between photo apps the library makes use of a custom clipboard in combination with custom url schemes the current image is first stored on the custom clipboard before the destination app is invoked via a special url scheme it has registered for such as for example colorsplashphotoapplink and and the destination app then pulls the image off the custom clipboard and proceeds straight into its main editing mode with the passed in image to find out which apps are supported and what url schemes they use the library contacts a server photoapplink com and downloads a plist file with this information the data is cached on disk so that photoapplink will work offline after the initial download sample app  the repository contains a sample app inside the testapp and subdirectory you can take a look at this app s code for an example of how to integrate and use the photoapplink library in addition to the documentation provided below the relevant parts of the code are fairly well documented furthermore you can use this test app as an example sender and receiver of images for testing the photoapplink integration in your own app during development integrating photoapplink into your app  the steps required to integrate photoapplink depend on whether your app will support only sending images to other apps only receiving images or both if it makes sense at all for your app we strongly encourage you to support both sending and receiving however we realize that for some types of apps it is appropriate to act purely as a sender or receiver of images the first step in any case is to drag the complete photoapplink and subdirectory into your xcode project make sure the option copy items into destination group s folder is checked in the dialog that appear after you drag the folder into xcode s project navigator sending an image to another app  to be able to send the current image to other participating apps the library first needs to download information about the currently supported apps from the server in your uiapplicationdelegate subclass add import  palmanager h at the beginning of your app delegate s applicationdidbecomeactive method add palmanager sharedpalmanager updatesupportedappsinbackground this will start a background thread to download the latest version of the plist mentioned above it will perform such an update at most every  hours and will only download the plist file if it has actually changed since the last successful download to avoid unnecessary bandwidth use next you will have to add the send to app feature into your app s ui we recommend using the following test and only offer the sent to app option in your ui if it is true objective c bool appsavailable palmanager sharedpalmanager supportedapps count  this ensures that there are compatible apps supported on the user s device that either can be launched or at least discovered and purchased via the more apps view the palsendtocontroller  the library includes the palsendtocontroller view controller which presents the available apps to the user in a nice ui see first image above the palsendtocontroller class not only displays the supported apps installed on the user s device but also takes care of actually invoking the selected app and passing along the current image you have two options for how to specify the current image you can set the image property on your palsendtocontroller instance before presenting it alternatively you can delay creating the image until the user actually selects one of the compatible apps to invoke in this case you would register a delegate with palsendtocontroller and implement the following delegate method objective c uiimage imageforsendtocontroller palsendtocontroller controller and and create an uiimage of your app s current edited image in full resolution and return it here return self currentfullresolutionimage the palsendtocontroller is designed to be added to a uinavigationcontroller you can either push it onto an existing navigation controller or use it as the root view controller of a new navigation controller and then present that modally like so objective c void presentmodalsendtoui palsendtocontroller sendtovc palsendtocontroller alloc init autorelease sendtovc image self currentfullresolutionimage uinavigationcontroller nav uinavigationcontroller alloc initwithrootviewcontroller sendtovc autorelease self presentmodalviewcontroller nav animated yes in addition to presenting the compatible apps installed on the user s device the palsendtocontroller allows you to add your own app specific sharing options for example you might have implemented sharing the current photo to facebook and twitter in your app if you like you could add these options to the ui presented by palsendtocontroller like this objective c void presentsendtoui palsendtocontroller sendtovc palsendtocontroller alloc init autorelease sendtovc image self currentfullresolutionimage sendtovc delegate self and and add custom buttons for your own sharing options sendtovc addsharingactionwithtitle facebook icon uiimage imagenamed facebook png identifier  sendtovc addsharingactionwithtitle twitter icon uiimage imagenamed twitter png identifier  self navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller sendtovc animated yes and and delegate method that gets called when a custom sharing item is selected by the user void photoapplinkimage uiimage image sendtoitemwithidentifier int identifier switch identifier self sendimagetofacebook image break self sendimagetotwitter image palsendtocontroller provides several additional optional delegate methods specified in palsendtocontroller h through which you can customize things such as how you want to dismiss the view controller after the user selects an app to invoke however the default behaviours should work just fine in most cases alternative send to app uis  while we recommend using the palsendtocontroller you can also implement your own custom ui for presenting the available apps to the user first check the array returned by palmanager sharedpalmanager destinationapps if it s not empty then there are compatible apps installed that can receive images use the array to iterate through all the palappinfo objects and build your own ui the palappinfo objects contain the apps name description and more once the user selects one of the apps call palmanager sharedpalmanager invokeapplication appinfo withimage currentimage to launch the selected app yet another option is to use a simple uiactionsheet objective c uiactionsheet actionsheet palmanager sharedpalmanager actionsheettosendimage self currentfullresolutionimage and and present in your view or using another show method actionsheet showinview self view you don t have to worry about implementing the action sheet delegate or dismissing it as palmanager handles all this for you and also takes care of sending the image to the selected app before presenting such an action sheet you must always check though that there are actually destination apps installed that could be displayed objective c bool destinationappsavailable palmanager sharedpalmanager destinationapps count  cross promotion via the palmoreappscontroller  one nice feature in photoapplink is the cross promotion of other compatible apps your app can be discovered inside other photoapplink compatible ios apps so you ll sell more copies and when a user discovers another photoapplink compatible app in your app and buys it you ll get a commission for the sale too at the bottom of the palsendtocontroller ui you will notice a  more apps button when tapped a palmoreappscontroller is presented that shows a list of all the participating apps the user doesn t have installed that are compatible with his and her device the store button next to each app takes the user to the app store passing along the linkshare id for the itunes affiliate program to ensure that you will receive the linkshare commission you will need to  edit palconfig h to set the value of linksharesiteid to your own linkshare siteid receiving images from other apps  first you need to register a custom url scheme for your app which will allow other participating apps to launch it in xcode this is easy to do  on the project navigator click on your project  go to the info tab of your target app  on the bottom right corner click add add url type  at the bottom of your app s properties you ll see the new  untitled url type expand that and enter a unique identifier for example your app s bundle identifier with photoapplink appended the url scheme can be anything but we recommend you use yourappname photoapplink where obviously you would replace the yourappname part you can ignore the icon and role fields next you need to implement the handling of your app being launched via the custom url scheme you just specified in general this should involve the following steps  if the app wasn t running before perform general app initialization  verify that the app was indeed launched via the custom url scheme you picked for photoapplink  get the passed in uiimage by calling palmanager sharedpalmanager poppassedinimage  display the image in your app and proceed to your app s main editor ui we recommend using the following structure in your app delegate which should do the right thing for ios   and later objective c and and handle the url that this app was invoked with via its custom url scheme and and this method is called by the different uiapplicationdelegate methods below bool handleurl nsurl url and and retrieve the image that was passed along from the previous app uiimage image palmanager sharedpalmanager poppassedinimage if image nil and and todo handle the passed in image as appropriate and and maybe something like self mainview image image and and it really depends on your app return yes return no bool application uiapplication application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions nsdictionary launchoptions and and basic app setup window addsubview navigationcontroller view window makekeyandvisible nsurl launchurl launchoptions objectforkey uiapplicationlaunchoptionsurlkey if launchurl nil and and application handleopenurl or application openurl sourceapplication annotation are invoked and and after this method returns to handle the url and perform additional setup else and and normal launch from springboard and and todo proceed with your normal app startup return yes and and this method will be called on ios   or later when the app is invoked via its custom url scheme and and if the app was not running already application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions will have been called before bool application uiapplication application openurl nsurl url sourceapplication nsstring sourceapplication annotation id annotation return self handleurl url and and this method will be called for ios versions   and   when the app is invoked via its custom url scheme and and if the app was not running already application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions will have been called before bool application uiapplication application handleopenurl nsurl url return self handleurl url  once you have integrated photoapplink into your app by following the steps above it is time to test whether it actually works as already mentioned above you can use the example app in the testapp and subdirectory as a counterpart to test sending images to it and receiving a test image from it simply open the xcode project testapp and photoapplinktestapp xcodeproj and compile and run it to install the app on your ios simulator or device  open the included file photoapplinkdebug plist in xcode this is a sample plist that describes a few photoapplist compatible apps including the test app  this plist contains an array of dictionaries representing the supported apps duplicate one of these dictionaries and customize it for your app see below for a description of the fields  save this file copy it to your dropbox public folder and get it s url via the dropbox context menu in the finder  open palconfig h in the project for the sending app and change the url of the define debugplisturl by pasting in the dropbox url for your edited plist file the debug plist is used only if debug is defined in the preprocessor to set this definition add the following setting to your xcode build setting make sure that this debug definition is active only for debug builds and not for the final release build the plist entry for your app  most of the entries in the plist dictionary for an app are fairly self explanatory name  your app s name as you want it to appear in the photoapplink ui description  short description used in the  more apps list make it short enough not to truncate the text and interesting enough to get people to check out your app appleid  your app s itunes id one way to get it is by connecting to itunes connect clicking  manage your applications  clicking on your app then on view details and finally binary details your apple id should be listed there bundleid  your bundle id is what you configured in your info plist  bundle identifier it is also listed in the binary details in itunes connect canreceive  whether your app supports receiving images using photoapplink cansend  whether your app supports sending images using photoapplink liveonappstore  whether a version of your app with photoapplink support is live on the app store already this only affects whether your app will be listed in the  more apps ui because we don t want to list apps there that don t yet have photoapplink support freeapp  whether your app is a free app if yes then the button on the  more apps list will say  free instead of store platform  can be  iphone   ipad or  universal this is used to filter the  more apps list to only show apps supported on the user s device scheme  the url scheme you registered for launching your app as discussed above something like  yourapp photoapplink if your app doesn t support receiving images you can ignore this field thumbnailurl  the url for your app s   icon image thumbnailxurl  the url for your app s   icon image register your app  once you have successfully integrated photoapplink into your app and are ready to submit it to the app store you should send us the plist entry for your app so that we can add it to the plist on our server just make a copy of the photoapplinkdebug plist you modified above delete all the other lines of the array leaving only your dictionary and send us this file to admins photoapplink com then it s just a matter of us copy and pasting this info into the production plist that gets downloaded by every photoapplink compatible app please also email us the  pixel icon of your app along with the info whether it has the default app store shine applied or not so that we can create the appropriate  and  pixel icons for your app finally please send us another email as soon as the photoapplink compatible version of your app goes live on the app store we can then change the status of your app s liveonappstore field to true so that your app can be discovered in other participating apps questions and bug reports  if you have a question not answered here feel free to contact us at admins photoapplink com

6646167, sparky js is a client side application scaffold which helps those who want to have organized structure in their app but don t want to subscribe to a particular client side mvc framework it provides such capabilities as a code router an event system an ajax wrapper and more sparky js is not a solution for javascript powered web apps rather it s a base for websites that are javascript heavy say goodbye to spaghetti js and hello to sparkyjs to fully utilize sparky s routing a few things must be done outside of the script in your application output the meta tags you see to the right with their respective content dynamically filled in with their appropriate values prepend the name of your meta attributes with app sparky will retrieve those values during initialization and save them as settings to fully utilize sparkys ajax utils and routing it is recommended you use code app url and code and app route with their respective values include jquery and the path to your sparky application and you re off doctype html head meta name app route content dashboard and following meta name app foo content bar and head body and body now that your meta tags are set lets explore what sparky does the utils object is used for caching objects outputting dynamic data defining app settings and routing your application upon calling utils settings init  the object utils settings will be filled with the data that was output from the meta tags excluding the app text that was prepended to the names utils cache is good for storing references to whatever it is you may be accessing frequently the function utils log is a wrapper for console log  so that way you may turn logging on and off via the debug variable in the settings object the log function is made more accessible by assigning the variable log to it making a log is easy lastly we have the utils route function note this is not to be confused with the routes object this function will extract our route as defined in our settings and see if a relative object exists within the routes object javascript utils settings debug true meta  init function meta name app each function utils settings meta this name replace app  this content   cache  homeurl function path if typeof path undefined path  return utils settings meta homeurl and path and and log function what if utils settings debug console log what  parseroute

the utils route function note this is not to be confused with the routes object this function will extract our route as defined in our settings and see if a relative object exists within the ruotes object the following routes would produce the following values if they were called in conjunction with a route object to the right foo and bar bar function sample and any any is not a function sample and any and depth and allowed depth init function  allowed function if your route exists and if there were any functions named init within your object literals they will be qued and then called in the order they were read allowing you to apply global logic to higher routes while trickling down to fine tune your code javascript var routes bar function log bar function sample depth init function log depth init function allowed function log allowed function though the process of ajax is simplified quite well with libraries like jquery it is beneficial to use a wrapper to avoid writing all the requests and simplify your life the base ajax object provided in sparky allows a simple way to make your request ajax call for post requests and ajax get for get requests a request for a like button might look like this javascript ajax call dolike  pictureid   function result and and success first parameter would be the method we want to call for our ajax script second parameter is the data and the third is the success function using a wrapper is beneficial for example you could output app userid in your meta and determine whether or not a user is logged in before they even make an ajax request javascript ajaxurl utils homeurl ajax  send function type method data returnfunc ajax type post  url ajax ajaxurl and method datatype json  data data success returnfunc  call function method data returnfunc ajax send post  method data returnfunc get function method data returnfunc ajax send get  method data returnfunc events play an important role in javascript and the dom javasript should be used to handle the logic but having the ability to bind events by writing html is a breeze and better represents what your specific elements can do say goodbye to the days of messy and disorganized event binding firstly create a few html elements in which you want to bind events to using html data attributes assigning data event to an element will bind it to the function name of its value for instance data event foo bar will bind it to events endpoints foo bar function if it exists events unlike routes are delimited by a dot but can be changed to whatever you d like the default event type bound to the element is the click event if you wish to listen for a different type of event add the data attribute data method to your element and it s value should be it s respective event type if you add to the dom and want to bind elements you may call events init or events bindevents elements that have already been bound will not be bound again thus binding only new elements provided are a few examples of the implementation of events the this keyword is available and if you need to inspect the event object you may pass it as a parameter to your endpoint function button data event auth login login and button javascript events endpoints  bindevents function data event each function var this this  method this attr data method and and click  name this attr data event  binded this attr data binded true if typeof events endpoints name undefined if binded this attr data binded  true this on method events endpoints name init function events bindevents button data binded true data event dologin login and button javascript events endpoints auth login function e and and your code   inputs filters numonly function e and and your code    bindevents function  init function the app object is used to start sparky bind events and route your code it can also house the core of your logic if you wish usually it is best to put any global logic in the app object the public object is returned to allow you to publicize any functions you wish elsewise the scope of your functionality will be within your application itself the app init function is returned by default javascript add any additional functions and objects you want here usually functions that will execute on every page or beefy worker functions logic  init function and and collect our settings and info utils settings init and and bind events to the dom events init and and execute page specific code utils route return function you want to have accessible globally sparky init app init public init app init

2580900, uilayer provides a javascript api on top of webkit for working with the concept of layers instead of manipulating dom elements using a myriad of mixed concepts you go though a single well defined api note uilayer only works in webkit based environments such as web views on apple ios os x and android or in web browsers like google chrome and safari here s a simple example a layer inside another layer which moves px to the right when touched rotating the inner layer like a wheel try it written in javascript  examples and example javascript html script var uilayer move require uilayer and script move compile d src o uilayer js create a new uilayer with optional initial properties the position and size of the layer in the coordinate space of its parent layer the returned uiframe object is a mutable proxy which when modified affects the layer that is you can do layer frame x  to move the layer to x position  rather than frame layer frame frame x  layer frame frame providing a width and and or height of  zero makes the layer span the width and and or height of it s parent layer anchor defined in superlayer coordinates controls which edges of the superlayer the layer is attached to or originates from defaults to top  left  this property always returns an object never a string which might contain any or none of the following values top number and string right number and string bottom number and string left number and string if a value is undefined that edge is not part of the layers anchor example of having a layer originating from the bottom right corner of its superview layer anchor bottom right print layer anchor bottom  right  example of having a layer originating from the bottom right corner of its superview with an offset of  pixels layer anchor bottom  right  print layer anchor bottom  right  example of making a layer span the entire width of its superlayer automatically being resized as the superlayer s frame size changes note that we do not specify a frame size layer uilayer anchor top right bottom left example of creating a layer that spans the width of its superlayer attached to the bottom layer uilayer anchor left bottom right  height  example examples and anchor html examples and anchor html modify position of the layer rotation of the layer defaults to x  y  z  the returned object is a proxy meaning it s possible to manipulate the values directly e g layer rotation x  angles are expressed in degrees   when setting this value rather than manipulating the returned proxy object  you only need to pass the values which you would like to modify there s also a single change rotation change rotation oldvalues x y z event emitted rather than one even per axis as implied by manipulating the proxy object example of rotating a layer around its z axis spinning like a wheel layer rotation z  example of setting several axis causing a single change event to be emitted layer rotation x  z  example examples and rotation html examples and rotation html scale of the layer defaults to    modify scale of the layer defines the transformation origin of the layer s bounds rectangle affects how transformations like scale and rotation behaves animatable described in the unit coordinate space defaults to       the center of the bounds rectangle example examples and transformorigin html examples and transformorigin html layers with a larger zposition will be placed in front of those with a smaller one defaults to  if set to true new layers will be assigned a random semi opaque background color aiding in development defaults to false example examples and debug html examples and debug html determines whether the receiver is displayed when facing away from the viewer defaults to false specifies a radius used to draw the rounded corners of the receiver s background defaults to  note cornerradius does not affect hit testing the background color of the layer defaults to transparent no background color also accepts but will canonicalize arrays of relative rgba values r g b a         r g b       rgb a     rgb   foreground text color of the layer defaults to the inherited value from the environment i e default browser style or host website style opacity of the layer defaults to  fully opaque hide or show the layer defaults to false a hidden view disappears from its window and does not receive input events it remains in its superview s list of sublayers however and participates in autoresizing as usual hiding a view with sublayers has the effect of hiding those sublayers and any view descendants they might have this effect is implicit and does not alter the hidden state of the receiver s descendants if you want to know if a layer is in a dom tree no matter if it s visible  see layer document layer document htmldocument returns a style object defining the layers computed style equivalent to window computedstyle for an element the explicit css style of the layer determines whether sublayers are confined to the bounds of the receiver defaults to false setting this value to true causes sublayers to be clipped to the bounds of the receiver if set to false sublayers whose frames extend beyond the visible bounds of the receiver are not clipped example examples and maskstobounds html examples and maskstobounds html used to give an illusion of depth it determines how layers change size based on their z offset from the z  plane you can think of it as though you re looking at the page from a distance p away layers on the z  plane appear in their normal size something at a z offset of p and  halfway between the viewer and the z  plane will look twice as big and something at a z offset of p will look half as big thus large values give a little foreshortening effect and small values lots of foreshortening values between  and  give a reasonable looking result for most content defaults to none i e no perspective or orthographic projection the default origin for the perspective effect is the center of the layer but you can control this with perspectiveorigin layer hidden bool example examples and perspective html examples and perspective html perspective origin defaults to      when set to false the default value  transformed sublayers are flattened into the plane of their superlayer think of the d transform as simply a painting effect however when setting this to true the layer to which it is assigned does not flatten its sublayers into it instead those sublayers live in a shared d space with the superlayer animate property changes defaults to false the value true indicates all properties should be animated a string value signifies only a subset of properties should be animated for instance all animate all properties equivalent to true geometry animate changes to geometry opacity animate changes to opacity you can define a list of css properties to be animated by separating them with a comma e g a value of width height opacity would cause frame size and opacity to be animated but not scale position etc layer uilayer x  y  width  height  layer animated true layer on touchstart  layer frame x and  layer moves  px to the right during ms when touched duration in milliseconds of animations implied by changing properties only effective if layer animated is set to true layer uilayer x  y  width  height  layer animated true layer animationduration  layer on touchstart  layer frame x and  layer moves  px to the right during ms when touched available timing functions linear  the linear function just returns as its output the input that it received ease  the default function ease is equivalent to cubic bezier         ease in  the ease in function is equivalent to cubic bezier        ease out  the ease out function is equivalent to cubic bezier       ease in out  the ease in out function is equivalent to cubic bezier        cubic bezier x y x y  specifies a cubic bezier curve whose p and p points are  and  respectively the four values specify points p and p of the curve as x y x y layer uilayer x  y  width  height  layer animated true layer animationtimingfunction ease out layer frame x  layer moves  px to the right during ms slowing down in the end provide a function to perform custom drawing of the layer s content this function will be invoked every time the frame size changes or the layer is added to the dom note a layer that implements custom drawing can not have sublayers example of drawing a triangle layer uilayer width  height  drawcontent g graphicscontextd g strokestyle red g moveto  g lineto  g lineto  g lineto  g stroke example examples and drawcontent html examples and drawcontent html the d drawing context for a layer with a drawcontent implementation the d webgl drawing context for a layer with a drawcontent implementation parent layer a list of all sublayers other layers that are owned by or live within the layer first sublayer equivalent to layer sublayers  but better performing in cases where a layer have many sublayers add a layer as a sublayer to the receiving layer returns the same sublayer that was passed as input remove a sublayer by reference or index returns the sublayer removed or undefined if no matching sublayer was found remove all sublayers returns the layers that was removed removes the layer from the superlayer test if a layer is a sublayer of another layer returns the farthest descendant of the layer hierarchy that contains a specified point example examples and hittest html examples and hittest html controls whether the layer is included in hit testing defaults to true setting this to false causes the layer to stop accepting user input such as touches and clicks and also being ignored by uilayer hittest the dom node which is used to represent the layer in the document can be assigned during creation but not later the dom document which this layer is owned by created by note that a layer always have a ownerdocument even if it s not in a dom tree the dom document which this layer is currently presented in if any you can use this to test if the layer is part of the dom tree or not if you just want to know if a layer is visible or not see layer hidden layer hidden bool remove an event handler emit or trigger and raise and send an event on the receiving layer layer on my custom event  ev print my custom event triggered with foo  ev foo layer emit my custom event  foo hello indicates whether the layer is backed by high performance d rendering or not assign a document wide unique tag to this layer this will effectively set id tag on the underlying element example examples and tag html examples and tag html find a layer anywhere in the document which has the specified tag a layer can emit any dom level  events as well as arbitrary

7809570, white elephant is a hadoop log aggregator and dashboard which enables visualization of hadoop cluster utilization across users to try out the server with some test data cd server and startup sh white elephant is compiled and tested against hadoop    and should work with any   x version hadoop   is not yet supported the server is a jruby web application in a production environment it can be deployed to tomcat and reads aggregated usage data directly from hadoop this data is stored in an in memory database to get started using the server first set up the environment cd server the default target does several things among them installs jruby to a local directory under rbenv installs ruby gems to the above directory downloads jars creates test data under data and usage at this point you should be able to start the server and startup sh since it is in development mode the app assumes local data should be used which it looks for in the directory specified in config yml the server configuration is contained in config yml you can see a sample in sampleconfig yml when run in development mode using and startup sh  sampleconfig yml is used and it follows the settings specified under local the only configurable parameter here is filepattern  which specifies where to load the usage data from on local disk when packaged as a war it runs in production mode and uses configuration specified under hadoop  the assumption being that the aggregated usage data will be available there the following parameter must be specified filepattern glob pattern to load usage files from hadoop libs directories containing hadoop jars to be added to the classpath confdir directory containing hadoop configuration to be added to the classpath principal user name used to access secure hadoop keytab path to keytab file for user to access secure hadoop white elephant does not assume a specific version of hadoop so the jars are not packaged in the war therefore the path to the hadoop jars must be specified in the configuration to build a war which can be deployed to tomcat the config file you specify will be packaged as config yml within the war see sampleconfig yml as an example for how to write the config file the script hadoop and scripts and statsupload pl can be used to upload the hadoop logs to hdfs so they can be processed check its documentation for details there are three hadoop jobs all managed by a job executor which keeps track of what work needs to be done the first two jobs parse and convert raw job configurations and logging into an easier to work with avro format together these two datasets can serve as the base data for a variety of usage analytics workflows the third and final job reads the avro fied log data and aggregates it per hour writing the data out in avro format it essentially builds a data cube which can be easily loaded by the web application into the db and queried against some sample configuration files can be found under hadoop and config and jobs base properties contains most of the configuration white elephant full usage job job file used when processing all logs white elephant incremental usage job job file used when incrementally processing logs the base properties file consists of configuration specific to white elephant and configuration specifically for hadoop all hadoop configuration parameter begin with hadoop conf the two job files just have a single settings incremental and only differ in the value they use for it within base properties is a parameter logs root this is the root path where the hadoop logs are found which are to be parsed the parsing job assumes the logs are stored in hadoop under daily directories using the following directory structure logs root and cluster name and daily and yyyy and mmdd for example logs on january rd  for the production cluster may be stored in a directory and data and hadoop and logs and prod and daily and  and  to create a zip package containing all files necessary to run the jobs simply run the job config dir should be the directory containing the properties and job files you would like to include in the package of choice then this zip file will work with it as long as you add the azkaban specific configuration to base properties after unzipping the zip package you can run using the run sh script this requires a couple environment variables to be set hadoopconfdir hadoop configuration directory hadooplibdir hadoop jars directory to run the full job and run sh white elephant full usage job to run the incremental job and run sh white elephant incremental usage job the incremental job is more efficient as it only processes new data the full job reprocesses everything white elephant is open source and freely available under

11460912, tweet secret  background and motivation  twitter accounts are either completely private or public if you have a public account and want to tweet something privately to a select list of people there is no simple way to do it how it works  the corpus text is parsed into a list of sentences filtered by character length to exclude anything longer than  characters in size this list of sentences is known as the set of eligible tweets messages are encoded by looking up each word token in a common dictionary then using that pointer reference sequence in one or more dictionary lists to a sentence in the set of eligible tweets whose preceeding cumulative string length matches the pointer that sentence becomes the tweet to be broadcast to correspond to the word token tweets are decoded by finding their position in the set of eligible tweets counting the cumulative string size up to that point and adding the amount of the offset marker if present the resulting number is the dictionary pointer which is used to lookup the corresponding word installation  next clone this repo to your computer go to the folder where it exists and run the following commands from a terminal lein deps lein uberjar if the build succeeds you should now have a jar file created in the repo s target folder named tt tweet secret   standalone jar and tt to run the tests use this command you will need an internet connection to have them run successfully since both the corpus and dictionary texts used in the texts are defined as remote urls lein test if successful you should see this lein test tweet secret core test ran  tests containing  assertions  failures  errors the current version works via the command line use the tt help and tt switch when invoking the standalone jar file to get the list of options java jar tweet secret   standalone jar help tweet secret text steganography optimized for twitter switches default desc  c corpus required at least one url or full path filename of the secret corpus text s known only by you and your friends d decode decode this tweet into plaintext if none present text after all the option switches will be encoded h no help help false show the command line usage help tweet size defines the maximum text size for an encoded tweet text the default is  characters which is the constraint imposed by twitter but this can be increased or decreased if desired note that changing it to anything but a positive non zero integer value will result in an error excess marker is the unobtrusive marker character within the encoded tweet text dictionary files defines a whitespace separated list of files or urls containing text word lists to use for the first pass of plaintext encoding words in messages to be encoded need to exist in at least one of the files or urls defined here so if your message uses specialized language or slang you ll need to have the appropriate dictionary file s defined here as well  a function to parse a string into a list of sentence strings and  a function to split a message string into word tokens where each token be expected to be found in one or more of the dictionary files property values as explained above function  corresponds to corpus parse fn and  corresponds to tokenize fn the i c and i or i corpus and i command line argument is required this is the secret book known only by you and the people you want to be able to understand your message see the examples below for some ideas of what to use here this is not something you need to calculate in advance but the best way to avoid it is to use the largest texts you can access and ideally more than just one at a time for security see the examples below for what this would look like if you do wind up using a corpus text which is too small the application will give you this error message sorry your corpus text is not large enough please use a larger text or include additional corpus options and try again warning booyah could not be processed if you try to decode a tweet which does not exist among the list of eligible tweets sentences derived from parsing all the corpus texts  you will be greeted with a tt warning could not be processed and tt warning suppose we want to encode the message b tonight we take paris by storm and b as a series of innocuous looking tweets the corpus text is known only by us and the followers we want to be able to read the message the corpus text should be changed frequently and ideally never ever used more than once it is also a good idea to use a list of several corpus texts in practice since this lessens the chances that someone spying could guess the corpus and break the code see below after this first example for what that looks like open a terminal go to the target folder containing the standalone jar file and type this command tonight we take paris by storm on mac osx you should also include tt dfile encoding utf  and tt as a command line argument to the java interpreter so that the tweet strings are output correctly tonight we take paris by storm this results in the following six tweets one for each word of the original message on the following morning the gener al requested permission to return the emperor s visit by waiting on him in his palace a pitched battle follow ed but the pride of iztapalapan on which its lord had freely l avished his care and his revenues was its celebrated gardens this form of governm ent so different from that of the surrounding nations subsisted till the arrival of the spaniards the mexica ns furnish no exception to this remark he  felt his empire melting away like a morning mist followers who know the corpus text can decode these tweets with this command decode on the following morning the gener al requested permission to return the emperor s visit by waiting on him in his palace decode a pitched battle follow ed decode but the pride of iztapalapan on which its lord had freely l avished his care and his revenues was its celebrated gardens decode this form of governm ent so different from that of the surrounding nations subsisted till the arrival of the spaniards decode the mexica ns furnish no exception to this remark decode he  felt his empire melting away like a morning mist which results in this list of words corresponding to the original message the encoding can also be done with multiple corpus texts either all remote urls or mixing urls and plain text files available on your computer s filesystem using multiple corpus texts instead of just a single corpus text is highly recommended  since it reduces the likelihood that someone attempting to crack your secret message discovers the underlying pattern it also help you avoid the tt corpus text is not large enough and tt error corpus and home and guest and downloads and random text txt corpus and home and guest and downloads and english txt tonight we take paris by storm the only caveat with using local files such as these is that your followers i e  people who decode the tweets must have the same exact files on their computers future todo  come up with a better strategy for handling message words which are not defined in the default dictionary files texts pack multiple short tweets together into a single broadcast tweet space permitting so that it s not always a   correspondence between words in the message to tweets not only harder to break but also more efficient use of bandwidth

14089607, a verlet based physics library for svg files written in coffeescript this library implements portions of the svg spec but there are still a lot of holes i d recommend using the included svg files as a rough idea of what will work and what won t  this library was abstracted out of my current portfolio there are various plugins included and here are some examples statwrapper because every js library needs some mr doob github com and mrdoob and stats  this isn t the easiest thing to get working but later versions might fix that for the time being i d recommend using an existing example page as a template a common workflow without code would be  open one of the example svg files in illustrator or whatever vector program  open the corresponding html page in a browser  make changes to the svg file hit save  refresh the browser to see the changes  npm install i m sure there are other ones out there so if any others work for you let me know toaster w any changes to your coffee files will automatically compile into js and main js calm down you don t need to use it just include the main js file and extend the classes however you want however you ll probably want to read the coffee source files to get an idea of what is going on inside copy and pasting svg data into the html file gets old fast open the external file html example you ll notice in the examples files there are little tidbits that are done outside of the classes this is where plugins can go and other changes to the scene  perhaps another canvas library would be a better match if you have recommendations please let me know  here are some various techs that this library takes advantage of if you re not already familiar an open source vector format supported by most browsers easy for designers to lay out thing looks great on high density screens at the moment all renderering is done by manipulating svg elements on the stage a simple and optimized way of implementing soft body physics it simply maintains a distance between two points this is the secret sauce for procedural animation if you re not familiar with it you should be it s use for the wind animation among other things this is used to determine which points are overlapping and then creates the appropriate verlet connections

7772213, a system for building mobile optimized rails applications using semantic media query based device detection and server side component optimization adapting server responses based on client side feature detection ress allows you to specify alternate versions of your website along with media queries for which devices should be redirected to which version when you register alternate mobile versions of your website ress adds annotations to the head of your document that describe where these pages are located and which devices should be redirected to them for example a typical alternate version for a mobile site might include a tag like this the mobile version of the page would then have a link pointing back the canonical these annotations conform to seo best practices for mobile optimized websites when a request comes into your site the javascript included with ress will parse all of the rel alternate links in your markup and evalute their media queries to determine if there is an alternate version available that matches the client if there is the user is redirected to the url for that version ress allows you to customize how your rails application responds to mobile requests in two ways  it adds controller and helper methods to detect which version of your site has been requested this is useful for small tweeks in html or behaviour eg if mobilerequest imagetag low res png else imagetag high res png end  it prepends a view path for each alternate version of your site so that you can override the templates or partials that are rendered for certain requests for example if you want to render a different html form for creating users on the mobile version of your site you could create app and mobileviews and users and form html erb and ress would have rails select that template over app and views and users and form html erb when a request comes in to the mobile version add this line to your application s gemfile gem ress and then execute bundle install run the generator rails g ress install alternate versions of an application are registered using the addalternate method in the ress rb initializer that is generated by the ress install generator the configurabe options you can manually override the version detector javascript and allow mobile clients to visit the canonical version of the app by passing in a the get url parameter forcecanonical  this sets a session cookie in a beforefilter that stops the version detection scipt from redirecting users so it only has to be done once per session ress includes a helper and controller method forcecanonical that returns a link back to the canonical version of the current page with this query param appended for example you may include something like this in your footer to let mobile users access the canonical site unless canonicalrequest you are currently viewing the mobile version of this site linkto view the desktop version  forcecanonicalurl and div end and footer there are a couple of modernizr features that must be included in order for ress s javascript feature detection to function if you are not already using modernizr in your application you can automatically include a build that has been packaged with the gem by setting config includemodernizr true in config and initializers and ress rb if you include your own build recommended  make sure that it includes touch events and media queries  eg in order to share sessions and cookies between the different subdomains used by the alternate versions of your app you need to configure the domain option both in the config and initializers and sessionstore rb and when setting cookies for more information about how this works see this because ress uses subdomains while developing alternate versions you cannot load your site via localhost or an ip address if you want to test on the same machine you are running your rails app on you can load it through for your app if you need to test on a mobile device you might want to try the javascript included by ress does some checks and will use client side redirection to point users to the right version of your webapp client side redirection can have a performance overhead though i haven t measured it if you find this is true you can keep your dom the same still using the seo friendly link rel alternate tags but simply remove the ress js script and do your own server side ua based redirection the feature detection javascript should work in all browsers that support document queryselectorall notably this excludes ie if you want it given how many browsers and devices we have these days there are bound to be bugs if you find them please report them and ideally fix them in a pull request  fork it  create your feature branch git checkout b my new feature

3930334, spar is an opinionated framework that makes developing and deploying single page web apps and static websites using modern front end technology like sass haml and coffeescript a cinch we created spar to decouple front end development and deployment from specific backend languages like ruby python or java who should use spar developers who have completely decoupled web applications i e old new twitter who want to do front end development with state of the art tools like coffeescript and sass independent of their backend api stack designers who love using modern technology like sass less and haml but don t feel comfortable running and deploying apps in frameworks like rails or django anyone who needs to make simple static websites and host them as static files on s i e for really really cheap under the hood spar uses rack and sprockets to provide a powerful asset pipeline similar to rail s asset pipeline if you re familiar with the rail s asset pipeline you ll feel right at home with spar what makes spar different intepret configuration variables in your assets for instance setup an apiurl variable that s different for your development vs production environments no server side language knowledge necessary if you know how to type a few commands into the terminal you ll be good to go built in support for css sass less html haml javascript coffeescript compass haml coffeescript templating and more for your reference and to build on top of we ve created two example applications using spar ruby    or greater preferably    gem install spar if using rbenv rbenv rehash issue the following command to create a new spar project spar new myapp cd myapp spar server spar apps are organized into the following folders and files and app compiled assets that make your app and images and javascripts application js coffee your main js output and stylesheets application css sass your main css output and pages index html haml your single root html page and static file in here will be available to your application but not managed as assets and downloads file in here will include a content disposition attachment header if deployed to s and vendor put external libraries like jquery or bootstrap here and javascripts and stylesheets config yml env settings for development staging production readme your project s readme config yml defines your project s configuration for different environments you may define any properties you like which are available to you in all your asset files these settings may be overriden on a per environment basis for development  staging  and production like so default debug true myappname my app debug false production debug false compress true spar respects the following known configuration options debug true and false includes js files individually for easier debugging digest true and false adds md hashes to end of filenames for proper cache busting in deploys compress true and false js and css compression uglify and yahoo ui css compressor all asset files in the app directory are transformed through the spar asset pipeline transformation first occurs for configuration properties defined in config yml  followed by js and css asset compilation and composition first configuration property substitution takes place according to your config yml file for instance if your index html haml looks like this title myappname it transforms to become title my app after spar performs configuration replacement it then process files according to their extensions inlcuded with spar are transformations from file html haml file html file js coffee file js file css sass file css file css less file less multiple javascript or css files can be merged into a single file using the require and requiretree pre processor directives if you want to serve one file say application js  that includes the content of multiple js files you may define an application js coffee like so coffeescript stylesheet files are composed similarly however directives should be placed in css and sass comments appropriately and require buttons css and most spar apps will compile into a single application js and application css file each including the deploy directive to ensure it is deployed if you wish to deploy additional root level asset files you may instruct spar to do so by adding a deploy directive at the top of the file like so coffeescript or in css and deploy and you only need to do this for additional root level javascript and css based files as spar deploys all images pages and static files automatically spar supports three different deployment methods out of the box local deploy your app to a directory local to your computer s deploy your app to an aws s bucket cloudfront deploy your app to an aws s bucket and invalidate a cloudfront distribution to deploy your app run spar deploy production you can pass any environment name to the deploy command typically staging or production to deploy to a local directory setup your config yml file environments like so default debug true deploystrategy local deploypath compiled and staging production deploystrategy local deploypath compiled and production the deploypath may be either a relative path in your application or a global path on your computer to deploy to an s bucket setup your environments like so production deploystrategy s awskey myaccesskey awssecret my and super and secret and access and key deploybucket mysite test com spar is licensed under the terms of the mit license see the included license file

2697304, with backbone d we aim to provide a simple interface to visualise with d dynamic data held in backbone collections the simple visualisations provided pie bar line scatter are as much for demonstration or testing as for wider use we ve tried to connect two great packages without putting too much between hopefully this means you can quickly create some basic plots of your data or get into more sophisticated visualisations without having to fight with asynchronous javascript or a lot of wrapper code so you can see the library in action any backbone collection of any backbone model can be used by the plotting view the collection containing them can have a caption variable set which will be rendered using markdown if pagedown is available under the plot this is all the backbone d plotcollection does some simple collections are provided for use with the canned views if your data maps onto these models and collections well you can just reuse them if you already have model and collections in use you should be able to reuse them trivially plotview is where the magic happens it deals with the captioning of plots and makes sure the appropriate actions are taken when data in the collection changes the plotview defines how the data is extracted from the collection through the plotdata method and how it is rendered to the browser via the plot method the plotview is responsible for both formatting and rendering the plot to allow one collection to be visualised in multiple ways the view can also hold a caption for the visualisation overriding the one set on the data collection as your collection changes so should your visualisation the change and add and remove triggers are bound to the redraw method of the plot view reset redraws the visualisation from scratch this triggers a d transformation updating the plot in place with your new data tasty each type of visualisation should be careful about referring to them as plots is a backbone view there are canned views for some common visualisations or ones we ve needed ourselves that are available in individual files to minimise what gets loaded under the backbone d canned namespace if you want to create more interesting visualisations you ll be subclassing the plotview baseclass please send pull requests if you make something nice

4655214, in my effort to re write and simplify this little gem i have made a discovery it is much easier to manage dotfiles and configuration manually and on a per system basis i have not even needed to touch this gem for personal use except once since the release of v   and have spent the last  months only realizing that there is not much that this gem can provide that you cannot achieve yourself with little extra effort dotify is a simple cli tool to make managing dotfiles on your system easy when developing on a linux and unix based system keeping track of all of those dotfiles in the home directory can be pain some developers do not even bother managing them and many have come up with their own static or even dynamic way of managing them this is a need in the community and this tool makes managing these crazy files a breeze as this is a gem for use on your local system i know there are still many ruby developers still stuck with using ruby   as such dotify supports the following ruby versions note as of v   jruby and rubinius are now only partially supported trying to support all of these versions is quite difficult with the nature of this gem so i will be focusing on mri run this command in the command line to install dotify gem install dotify to install dotify you must first run dotify install in your terminal dotify install create and users and computer user and dotify create and users and computer user and dotrc editing config file do you want to link bashrc to the home directory yn n linked and users and computer user and bashrc do you want to link dotrc to the home directory yn n linked and users and computer user and dotrc do you want to add railsrc to dotify yn n linked and users and computer user and railsrc do you want to add zshrc to dotify yn n linked and users and computer user and zshrc this will first create a dotify directory in your home directory as well as a dotrc file for dotify configuration yes it is more dotfiles but this is a good thing during the installation process a vim instance will open with a sample dotrc file for you to edit and configure if you desire this will allow your configuration to be used prior to dotify s full installation see more about the dotrc file in the configuration configuration section alternatively you could run dotify setup to setup dotify s configuration followed by dotify install to add the initial files into dotify already have your setup on github and want it back or copied to your other machine see another setup that you want to try run the github task with the username and repo you want for example dotify github mattdbridges and dots pulling mattdbridges and dots from github into and users and computer user and dotify backing up dotfile and installing dotify files successfully installed mattdbridges and dots from github this command will pull the repo from github into the and dotify path if it does not already exist it will then backup any existing dotfiles matching those in the new and dotify directory and link all the files you just pulled down from github if dotify detects that you have submodules inside of your vim configuration for example  it will automatically initialize and update them not pull them from the original repos you may not actually be using github easy just use the repo task and give it the full git url dotify repo git and and github com and mattdbridges and dots git pulling git and and github com and mattdbridges and dots git from github into and users and computer user and dotify backing up dotfile and installing dotify files successfully installed git and and github com and mattdbridges and dots git from github after you have setup dotify you can add files one by one if you did not add them during setup dotify link vimrc linked and users and computer user and vimrc no one likes to go and look for the symlinks of their dotfiles manually just check to see which files are being managed by dotify by running dotify list dotify list dotify is managing  files bashprofile dotrc gemrc gitconfig gitignoreglobal don t want any of the dotfiles anymore or want to drop one well i m not one to question go ahead and move them back into the home directory dotify unlink do you want to unlink bashprofile from the home directory yn y unlinked and users and computer user and bashprofile do you want to unlink dotrc from the home directory yn y unlinked and users and computer user and dotrc do you want to unlink gemrc from the home directory yn should you run this task and decide to change your mind you can simply run dotify link or dotify link file again if you want to restore your changes by default unlink loops through all of the dotify files you can also pass a filename to unlink to unlink a single file dotify unlink bashrc are you sure you want to remove and bashrc yn y unlinked and users and computer user and bashrc add your remote repository via git remote add name repo from this point you can manage your dotfiles entirely from dotify to edit a dotfile managed by dotify simple run dotify edit dotfile and replace dotfile with the name of the file you want to edit this will open a vim instance containing that file for editing once you have saved your edits simple run dotify save and dotify will walk you through the steps of committing your changes and pushing them up to github when you run dotify edit dotfile  by default the file opens in vim for editing you can change this by adding this following to your dotrc file editor vi or vim or emacs etc when you are linking files in your dotify directory some files you do not want ever want to link git  gitmodules  gitignore  etc because they are used specifically for that directory such as git versioning you can configure dotify to ignore these files when calling dotify link in the dotrc in this way cat and dotrc ignore dotify git gitmodules gitignore the same can be done for the home directory when running dotify setup there are some directories that you should not move around dropbox  rbenv  rvm and do not want to accidentally attempt to move you can do that in your dotrc file as well cat and dotrc ignore dotfiles dropbox rbenv rvm more configuration options will likely be added in future versions so be sure to check up here for your options dotify help tasks dotify edit file edit a dotify file dotify github username and repo install the dotfiles from a github repo into dotify backs up any files that would be overwritten dotify help task describe available tasks or one specific task dotify install install files from your home directory into dotify dotify link filename link up one or all of your dotfiles filename is optional dotify list list the installed dotfiles dotify save save dotify files and push to github dotify setup setup your system for dotify to manage your dotfiles dotify unlink filename unlink one or all of your dotfiles filename is optional dotify version check your dotify version this tool is

2565808, when you re working in a business environment especially an enterprisy environment  business rules make the world go round business level decision makers need to be able to alter application behavior and logic with minimal technical invasiveness usually business rule engines come packaged as k java installations and a gaggle of business consultants let s just call this a lighter weight solution the goal of this library is to  give javascript developers drop in jquery ui widgets for building business rule interfaces  give developers a rule engine that can be ported to any server side language for running business rules built with the ui tools checkout the examples directory if you just want to dive in it demonstrates all the features pretty well the fn conditionsbuilder method has two forms the first being javascript mydiv conditionsbuilder fields  data the first form creates a conditionsbuilder object for the given dom element with the passed fields and data the fields param is an array of objects that define the factors that can be used in conditional statements each has a label  name and an array of operators it may also have an options array of objects with label and name each operator is an object with label  name and fieldtype the fieldtype can be none the operator does not require further data entry ie present  blank text user will be presented with an input of type text textarea user will be presented with a textarea select user will be presented with a select dropdown populated with the parent field s options array the data param is an object that will be used to initially populate the ui ie if business rules have already been created and the user wants to edit them if the data option is not passed the ui will be generated without any initial conditions the object passed as data should be a conditional object  meaning it has a single key of all or any and a value of an array of nodes these nodes can either be rule objects or nested conditional objects a rule object has name  operator and value strings the name should match a field s name property the operator should match an operator s name property and the value is an arbitrary string value entered by the user in the ui once the ui has been built by the conditionsbuilder and the user has entered information the data can be retrieved by using the second form of the conditionsbuilder method javascript var data mydiv conditionsbuilder data this will serialize the entered conditionals into a data object this object can be persisted and then later used to create a new conditionsbuilder for editing this data object will also be used to instantiate a businessrules ruleengine object for running the conditional logic the fn actionsbuilder has an identical api to fn conditionsbuilder  but it uses a different data structure the fields property should be an array of action objects each action object has a label and name an action object may have a fields property that is an array of action objects allowing for nested action data all action objects that are not top level should also have a fieldtype of text  textarea or select here s an example of what a send email action could look like javascript mydiv actionsbuilder fields label send email  value sendemail  fields label to  name to  fieldtype text  label cc  name cc  fieldtype text  label bcc  name bcc  fieldtype text  label subject  name subject  fieldtype text  label body  name body  fieldtype textarea action objects with a fieldtype of select should not have a fields property rather they have an options property with a label and name for each option that option object however can have a fields property this allows you to specify nested fields that will only be displayed if the given option has been selected building on the last example this allows the user to specify an email template or use a custom subject and body javascript mydiv actionsbuilder fields label send email  value sendemail  fields label to  name to  fieldtype text  label cc  name cc  fieldtype text  label bcc  name bcc  fieldtype text  label email template  name template  fieldtype select  options label welcome email  name welcomeemail  label followup email  name followupemail  label custom email  name customemail  fields label subject  name subject  fieldtype text  label body  name body  fieldtype textarea in this example the subject and body fields will only be displayed if the user has selected the custom email template option to get the data out of the ui run the actionsbuilder method with data javascript var data mydiv actionsbuilder data each action data object has a name that matches the corresponding field s value  and a value property with the user entered value it may also have a fields array of nested action data objects which correspond to the nested field structure of the builder while the conditionsbuilder and actionsbuilder give us a ui to build business rule configurations we still need something to interpret the configuration apply the logic and conditionally run the actions this is where the businessrules ruleengine comes in the ruleengine is initialized with a conditions object and an actions array just as they would be when fetched from the ui using conditionsbuilder data and actionsbuilder data this would be a common way of instantiating a ruleengine javascript var engine new businessrules ruleengine conditions myconditions conditionsbuilder data  actions myactions actionsbuilder data once your engine has been instantiated you can use the run method to apply the conditional logic to a set of data and then conditionally run the actions since the engine is only responsible for running logic and shouldn t have to be aware of the actual data you need to pass in an object that represents the context to run conditionals on and another object with functions that map to the actions for example javascript var engine new businessrules ruleengine conditions all name name  operator present  value  name age  operator greaterthanequal  value   actions name action select  value givedrink  fields name drinktype  value martini var conditionsadapter name joe  age  var actionsadapter givedrink function data alert gave user a and data find drinktype engine run conditionsadapter actionsadapter values used in the conditionsadapter can be simple strings and numbers but it can also be a function that will be lazily executed for example this adapter would pull the name and age from fields on the page a more likely scenario than hard coded values javascript var conditionsadapter name function namefield val  age function agefield val it is also possible to use asynchronous functions in your conditionsadapter to do so have your function accept a callback function and call it when you have your value javascript var conditionsadapter logovisible function done and and cannot determine if logo is visible until dom ready function var visible logo is visible done visible the businessrules ruleengine object can be used in either the browser or in a server environment ie node js it could also be ported to another language simply enough or run inside a javascript runtime within ruby java etc the ruleengine comes with the following standard operators that can be used inside conditionals present equalto notequalto greaterthan greaterthanequal lessthan lessthanequal includes matchesregex custom operators can be added to a ruleengine using the addoperators method javascript var engine new businessrules ruleengine conditions all name password  operator longerthan  value   actions engine addoperators longerthan function actual length return actual length parseint length  it is also possible to create asynchronous operators if your logic cannot be run synchronously to do so simply have your operator function accept a third callback param and call it when you have your result javascript engine addoperators delayedoperator function actual target done settimeout function done true   the addoperators method also allows you to override the standard operators if heaven forbid you find that necessary when a function on your actionsadapter object is called it is passed a finder object the finder object has a data property that will return the action s data structure so that you can traverse it yourself this data structure can look something like javascript name drinktype  value martini  fields name olivecount  value   name shaken  value yes while you certainly can traverse this structure chances are you just want to quickly access the values this is why the finder gives you the find convenience method which takes one or more names and returns the matching value javascript var actionsadapter givedrink function data var drinktype data find drinktype  olivecount data find drinktype  olivecount  shaken data find drinktype  shaken console log drinktype olivecount shaken and and martini    yes

project for my bs degree at santa clara university i wrote this entire project in webgl and html after implementing several other similar prototypes in native code c and and and opengl and etc the decision to implement in webgl and html was due to a number of factors but mainly for the learning experience to try something new this is really my first time making a nontrivial html app also random people are far more likely to try a web app than a native app simply because web apps don t require you to invest the time effort caution etc that is associated with installing and running native binary packages so even for this reason alone i could have justified the risky proposition of rewriting my entire senior design project from scratch in html webgl and js note that this entire project was written completely from scratch in about four weeks of solid work spread out across about a month and a half with breaks in between  during which time i learned the necessary tools coffeescript because i dislike javascript  webgl glmatrix jquery as always it s just a matter of googling a lot of things until you re proficient which never takes long also no third party d engine was used to build kosmos because none were powerful enough to accomplish what i needed huge universe high resolution planets running almost everything on the gpu etc all of kosmos the source code you see in this repository except for the external folder was implemented from the ground up over these few weeks however the ideas and algorithms behind kosmos s technology have been generally within my focus over the past few years i m very familiar in depth in many areas of d graphics which no doubt accelerated my learning curve kosmos this web based version version was mostly an experimental self educational project for me in retrospect webgl simply has too many compatibility issues and hassles for it to be a valuable target for my spare time projects my future versions or projects will most likely be done with native code instead certainly until webgl stops being flakey and browsers figure out how to get closer to native performance for example i d like to make a future improved version of kosmos as a mobile game app targeting tablets in particular additionally there are a lot of features i d include that i didn t have time for in the current web based version planet atmospheres with correct simulated atmospheric scattering effects much more ground level detail i e trees grass etc animated planet orbits and rotations more variety of planet types right now there s just a few base types gameplay dynamics with space and ground combat however since following graduation most of my time will be dedicated to full time work kosmos   probably won t be likely any time soon exept possibly as a weekend project webgl is flakey and not ready for serious d games yet except the most rudimentary last gen graphics procedural content generation while a nice idea in concept ultimately doesn t save you all that much work in theory it provides infinite variation of planets stars etc  but it does not provide infinite novelty what we find interesting artistically and visually is not variation but novelty while admittedly a more vague word novelty represents content that is truly new  rather than just parameterized variations of the same thing seen before although procedural generation engines like kosmos can provide infinitely varying universes with trillions of stars without the need for each to be individually designed it becomes boring after a while because our minds eventually adapt and figure out the underlying patterns very rapidly therefore some amount of hand crafting and artistically created content is needed to make content sufficiently interesting for a game for example however one possible exception would be a more intricately simulation oriented generation system i e rather than simple mathematical functions to generate planet resembling things actually simulate gasses in space gravity in space star formation planet formation erosion elements etc etc this could produce a system so complex that variation does become truly novel in some sense simply from the sheer scale and detail of the simulation however doing this would require far too much computational power to be feasible in real time on even powerful gaming computers let alone mobile and casual devices it might be feasible though as a offline content creation tool to ease the work of artists however or it could be feasible if offloaded to a supercomputing cloud  with the data streamed to users of the game world on demand even then though creating the rules for such a simulation would be no small feat in of itself so for at least quite some time i think most d worlds will need to have some aspect of human guided design to be effectively interesting for games this doesn t rule out procedurally generated content by any means it just means you ll probably spend about as much time crafting procedural rules and equations as an artist would making it by hand anyway the following external open source libraries were used in kosmos all design and technologies of kosmos from ui and ux design and d engine implementation to several cutting edge technology and algorithm inventions are the sole creations of john judnich designed and implemented entirely from scratch using only the external open source libraries mentioned above

1505103, note if you are checking out pencil for the first time you should check out the rewrite branch in beta which has lots of nice updates pencil is a monitoring frontend for graphite it runs a webserver that dishes out pretty graphite urls in hopefully interesting and intuitive layouts some features are easy configuration pretty much anything you d want to do with the graphite composer can be coded into pencil configs using yaml syntax implicit collection of host and cluster data pencil picks these up from graphite without you having to explicitly define configuration details relative and absolute timespecs with auto refresh timeslices are measured in terms of a possibly relative starting time and a duration timespecs are parsed using the you can use pencil in tail mode i e constant refresh looking at last couple hours of data or to view a particular timeslice in the past time quantum support requests can be mapped into discrete intervals e g  seconds so that all requests within a window are treated as if they are the same request this eases the burden on graphite to generate real time images that are only slightly different than those generated by earlier requests it also makes it easy to add some sort of caching layer permalinks turn a relative timeslice such as the last  hours into an absolute one for placing in bug reports and all sorts of other useful things lots of views and navigation ui for bouncing around them global cluster dashboard and host views gem install pencil dependencies are sinatra mongrel chronic chronicduration fixme versions you should have a working graphite installation your metrics need to be composed of three pieces m  metric the common part of each graphite path c  cluster cluster name varies with query must not contain periods h  host host name varies with query must not contain periods the metricformat string is specified in a configuration file see below  and defaults to m c h it should contain only one m but is otherwise mostly unrestricted you need to set up yaml configuration files in order for pencil to work pencil searches the current directory or with d dir dir for yaml files to load the important top level configuration keys are config graphs dashboards see examples and for an example configuration directory here s an example pencil yml which contains general configuration options

name options hash options specified in a dashboard for a graph override the options in the original graph s definition when displaying the dashboard pencil loads all the yaml files in its configuration directory and subdirectories to facilitate organization of graphs and dashboards into multiple files the graphs and dashboards top level keys are merged recursively during the load the resulting pencil data structure will include all graphs and dashboards defined under these keys a few words on host filters two wildcards are supported and consumes as and and like a shell wildcard and as and d and and one or more digits be aware that may require explicit enumeration in graphite urls and is currently implemented in this way and you might have to configure apache to accept longer urls if you have many hosts that match a a simple target is just a metric options map targets can also be complex where the key is an ordered list of simple targets this is useful for example if you want to graph the summation of a list of metrics see docs and penciloptions md for a list of supported transforms complex targets are denoted with the yaml s look like this memorygraph title memory usage targets system memory total opt value opt system memory free system memory cached system memory shared system memory buffers  key memory used color green diffseries as you can see the memory used is computed by taking the difference of the total memory and its many uses once you ve set up the configs you should be able to just run and get something up on localhost  from there you should be able to click around and see various interesting collections of graphs with no options pencil looks in the current directory for yaml files and loads you can bind to a specific port with p port and specify a configuration directory with d dir other rack related options will be added at some point in the future

6930390, walkabout js  walkabout js is an automatic web application tester it randomly simulates a user this code figures out what your application is paying attention to and does it it fills in fields with random values it finds the events you listen for and fires those events it finds internal links tester for your app it has special support for jquery and uses source code rewriting to detect what your application is listening for in the absence of jquery jquery leaves evidence on dom nodes about what is being listened for you can use it like so if you are using jquery javascript and and this makes something like some input val return random values jquery fn val patch and and now fiddle around do  random things walkabout runmanyactions times  you can also give walkabout hints about what s a valid input this lets it guess application progressing values more often you can add data walkabout disable  to any element to suppress activation of that element or any of its children you can use data walkabout eventname to set attributes on the event that is created such as data walkabout keyup which  you can use data walkabout options a  b to give the valid inputs for a field you can use data walkabout edit value type paste delete move to have walkabout do edit operations inside a textarea or input type text you give a space separated list of the things to do type a key at the cursor and fire keyup  paste at the cursor and fire paste  delete the selection or delete before or after the cursor or move the cursor around bookmarklet  if you want to try walkabout js on some random jquery site you can load walkabout and also start a simple ui to start the runs in addition to starting a run it ll also track any uncaught errors and any calls to console warn or console error non jquery support  there s some support for working with code that doesn t use jquery it might work with other frameworks by catching their calls to addeventlistener  but is more intended to work with code that doesn t use a framework note if you know equivalent ways to detect what other frameworks are listening for patches to walkabout would be welcome or issues with details and examples that can be tested on this technique uses code rewriting to capture calls to addeventlistener and value the code can t be weirdly tricky it needs to actually use those literal names which is usually fine in normal code but might not be in fancy or optimized code e g  el addeventlistener would not be found nor would a addeventlistener el a you can use walkabout rewritelisteners code to rewrite the code the code transformation looks like this javascript document getelementbyid el addeventlistener click  function  true var value document getelementbyid textarea value and and becomes walkabout addeventlistener document getelementbyid el  click  function  true var value walkabout value document getelementbyid textarea and to find actions you use walkabout findactions element see proxy server proxy server for an option to use this by default walkabout will only go to links on the current page i e  href something this is because it will lose its context and potentially not load on the next page but if you want walkabout to move to other pages you can use walkabout options anylocallinks or set it to something like and dir and which will only follow links under and dir and if you use walkabout options loadpersistent true then it will save the state in localstorage and continue where it left of when another page is loaded proxy server  an application could include walkabout js on its own and if it doesn t use jquery it could also run walkabout rewritelisteners on all its code but maybe you don t feel like doing that maybe you want to try it out without all that work also by default walkabout will try to stay on the current page but in the proxy mode because it knows walkabout will load on each page it will freely move about the there is a proxy server node proxy js that makes this easier as you might guess you have to install node js to use it the server expects to receive requests for the website you want to actually access to do this you have to edit and etc and hosts to point the request locally e g     site to test com locally and the proxy server in turn will forward the request to the actual server any html responses will have the walkabout javascript added and javascript will be rewritten note that it binds to port  and so you must run it as root this isn t awesome pull requests to drop root welcome a tool like when you are done you should definitely stop the server and undo the and etc and hosts entry note many live sites seem to notice the proxy though i don t know how my ip got blocked for a week from news ycombinator com after using it in my own testing any ideas welcome you can control the proxy with environmental variables port for the port to bind to default   bind for the interface to bind to default         means all interfaces  and portaliases which looks like domain  domain  which lets you proxy from one port to another helpful sometimes when you need to proxy to a server running locally this is available under the lots of stuff of course but sometimes the validation options like data walkabout options should be obeyed and sometimes they should be ignored obeying them progresses you through the site disobeying them does some fuzz testing not all form controls get triggered i think e g  checkboxes don t get checked val should figure out better what s a reasonable return value e g  a textarea returns multi line strings a checkbox returns true and false probably val hacking should just go away and only do real editing of the fields the generator could have smarts about what scripts i e  action sequences are successful and which are not starting with a successful script that progresses you through the application  and then tweaking that script and increasing randomness at the end of the script we could look at code coverage as a score or we could even just look at event coverage hidden elements often have events bound but we know they have to be visible to be triggered we d like to explore paths where they are visible something more gaussian with the values generated like sometimes you should make a  character input but maybe not as often as a  character input and sometimes a  character input the values should be biased towards fencepost values e g  a bug that isn t triggered when you enter  is unlike to be triggered by   but more likely with     or  data walkabout options should be treated more as additional suggestions instead of the only suggestions they represent valid inputs that will keep the application going but invalid inputs are still sometimes interesting still the given options should be generally preferred when picking random options once a path has shown itself to get us to new code via code coverage or that we see new action options we might want to explore that specific code path further maybe instead of a single random number seed we could have a sequence of seeds     meaning use seed  for  numbers then reseed exploring a different path but with the same start as a known successful path a corollary of the above we should have a signature for a set of actions so we can quickly see if a set is unique configuration should be possible externally not just on attributes on the dom this would be fairly simple stuff like walkabout options elements name suggest bob  some way of indicating a bug detector like you know in some circumstances some element doesn t show when it should or something these would be functions that would be run in between actions simple assertions might work okay but some tests are expensive or tricky but in cases when you don t get an error but have noticed that invalid things can happen without an exception a detector might help create a reproducable case this could also be a kind of pause when detector quickcheck has this notion of making a test as small as possible basically seeing if you can get to the same error case with a smaller set of actions this could be pretty straight forward for walkabout as well though in cases like do something cancel something do something again do error thing it might be tricky we want to trim the first two actions but trimming either one alone won t make the path possible so we have to look for chunks we can pull out with action signatures it might be easier to determine such chunks with code coverage it would be interesting to see which scripts had changed by seeing if any of the code they touch changed then those scripts could be re run making screencaps at various points would be interesting these would be a freeze of the visible dom browsermirror style we could do them only when we ve determined a path that is interesting i e  maybe shows an error  by rerunning from the having a reset app hook would be good so we can truly rerun combining signatures we could try to determine if the app wasn t deterministic despite our efforts we should patch math random we could consider timeouts an actionable thing we could keep our own fake internal clock mocking date and settimeout and setinterval  and moving it ahead in a predictable way we could simulate conditions like a computer going to sleep this way simulate pagehide and pageview at least the non deterministic ones this involves mocking each one out except event ones which work kind of like other events maybe hook up to can issue events that we aren t generally allowed to issue dispatchevent doesn t work with keyboard events for instance otoh we could also reimplement the event dispatch process put in touch events on mobile and suppress hover events

10277920, so you wanna build a crowdfunding site splash image tutorial and img and banner png the tools to get funded by the crowd should belong to the crowd that s why i want to show you how to roll your own crowdfunding site i in less than  lines of code and i everything in this tutorial is open source and we ll only use other open source technologies such as node js mongodb and balanced payments  quick start if you just want the final crowdfunding site clone this repo and go to the and demo folder all you need to do is set your configuration variables and you re ready to go for everyone who wants the nitty gritty details carry on  setting up a basic node js app with express create a new folder for your app to install the express node module run this on the command line inside your app s folder npm install express next create a file called app js  which will be your main server logic the following code will initialize a simple express app which just serves a basic homepage and funding page for your crowdfunding site and and configuration var campaigngoal  and and your fundraising goal in dollars and and initialize an express app var express require express var app express app use and static  express static dirname and and static and and serve static files app use express bodyparser and and can parse post requests app listen  and and the best port and and serve homepage app get and function requestresponse and and todo actually get fundraising total response send link rel stylesheet type text and css href and static and fancy css and h your crowdfunding campaign and h and h raised out of and campaigngoal tofixed  and and h and and and serve funding page app get and fund function requestresponse response sendfile fund html create another file named fund html this will be your funding page link rel stylesheet type text and css href and static and fancy css h donation page and h optionally you may also include a stylesheet at and static and fancy css  so that your site doesn t look hella nasty for the rest of this tutorial margin px font family raleway and sexy font and font weight  finally run node app on the command line to start your server crowdfunding homepage  tutorial and img and homepage png the homepage will display the campaign goal you set in the configuration section of app js the donations page isn t functional yet so in the following chapters i ll show you how to accept and aggregate credit card payments from your wonderful backers  getting started with balanced payments they ve open sourced their whole site their chat logs are publicly available and they even discuss their roadmap in the open best of all you don t even need to sign up to get started with balanced and they ll generate a brand new test marketplace for you that you can claim with an account afterwards remember to keep this tab open or save the url so you can come back to your test marketplace later balanced test marketplace tutorial and img and balanced png click the settings tab in the sidebar and note your marketplace uri and api key secret balanced settings tutorial and img and balanced png copy these variables to the configuration section of app js like this and and configuration var balancedmarketplaceuri and v and marketplaces and test yourmarketplaceuri var balancedapikey yourapikey var campaigngoal  and and your fundraising goal in dollars now let s switch back to fund html to create our actual payment page this javascript library will securely tokenize the user s credit card info so your server never has to handle the info directly meaning you will be free from pci regulations append the following code to fund html  replacing balancedmarketplaceuri with your actual marketplace uri script var balancedmarketplaceuri and v and marketplaces and test yourmarketplaceuri balanced init balancedmarketplaceuri and script next create the form itself asking for the user s name the amount they want to donate and other credit card info we will also add a hidden input for the credit card token that balanced js will give us the form below comes with default values for a test visa credit card append this to fund html form id paymentform action and pay and balanced method post button onclick charge pay with credit card and button notice the pay button does not submit the form directly but calls a charge function instead which we are going to implement next the charge function will get the credit card token from balanced js add it as a hidden input and submit the form append this to fund html script and and get card data from form function getcarddata and and actual form data var form document getelementbyid paymentform return name form name value cardnumber form cardnumber value expirationmonth form expirationmonth value expirationyear form expirationyear value securitycode form securitycode value and and charge credit card function charge and and securely tokenize card data using balanced var carddata getcarddata balanced card create carddata function response and and handle errors anything that s not success code  if response status  alert response error description return and and submit form with card uri var form document getelementbyid paymentform form carduri value response data uri form submit and script this form will send a post request to and pay and balanced  which we will handle in app js for now we just want to display the card token uri paste the following code at the end of app js and and pay via balanced app post and pay and balanced function requestresponse and and payment data var carduri request body carduri var amount request body amount var name request body name and and placeholder response send your card uri is and request body carduri your payment form should now look like this funding form  tutorial and img and funding png the default values for the form will already work so just go ahead and click pay with credit card make sure you ve replaced balancedmarketplaceuri in fund html with your actual test marketplace s uri your server will happily respond with the generated card uri token funding form  tutorial and img and funding png next up we will use this token to actually charge the given credit card  charging cards through balanced payments before we charge right into this haha let s install two more node js modules for convenience run the following in the command line npm install request a library for simplified http requests because we ll be making multiple calls to balanced let s also create a helper method the following function returns a promise that the balanced api has responded to whatever http request we just sent it append this code to app js and and calling the balanced rest api var q require q var httprequest require request function callbalanced urlparams and and promise an http post request var deferred q defer httprequest post auth user balancedapikey pass  sendimmediately true json params  function errorresponsebody and and handle all bad requests error xx or internal server errors error xx if body statuscode  deferred reject body description return and and successful requests deferred resolve body return deferred promise now instead of just showing us the card token uri when we submit the donation form we want to  create an account with the card uri  charge said account for the given amount note you ll have to convert to cents for the balanced api  record the transaction in the database note we re skipping this for now and covering it in the next chapter  render a personalized message from the transaction replace the app post and pay and balanced  callback from the previous chapter with this and and pay via balanced app post and pay and balanced function requestresponse and and payment data var carduri request body carduri var amount request body amount var name request body name and and todo charge card using balanced api and response send

handy for rapid prototyping because of its dynamic schemas in other words you can just make stuff up on the fly this will be useful if in the future you want to record extra details about each donation such as the donator s email address reward levels favorite color etc start up a mongodb database and get its uri but for this tutorial let s run mongodb locally once you ve done that add the mongodb uri to your configuration section at the top of app js and and configuration var mongouri mongodb and and localhost  and test var balancedmarketplaceuri and v and marketplaces and test yourmarketplaceuri var balancedapikey yourapikey var campaigngoal  and and your fundraising goal in dollars now let s install the native mongodb driver for node js npm install mongodb add the following code to the end of app js this will return a promise that we ve recorded a donation in mongodb and and recording a donation var mongo require mongodb mongoclient function recorddonation

skipped over actually recording a donation to a database go back and replace that section of code with this and and todo actually log the donation with mongodb and return q fcall function return donation and and record donation to database return recorddonation donation restart your app and make another donation if you run db donations find on your mongodb instance you ll find the donation you just logged transaction  tutorial and img and transaction png just one step left finally we will use these recorded donations to calculate how much money we ve raised  completing the donation whether it s showing progress or showing off you ll want to tell potential backers how much your campaign s already raised to get the total amount donated simply query for all donation amounts from mongodb and add them up here s how you do that with mongodb with an asynchronous promise for it append this code to app js and and get total donation funds function gettotalfunds and and promise the result from database var deferred q defer mongo connect mongourifunction errdb if err return deferred reject err and and get amounts of all donations db collection donations find  amount  and and

6036663, this project will no longer be maintained i am in the process of working with vinceg to combine the functionality because my plugin was really a port from a jquery ui and wijmo plugin i feel that it is far from optimal for use with bootstrap it does it s job but it has a lot of overhead and baggage from the aforementioned projects that i m not fond of vince s project on the other hand is built from the ground up with the spirit of bootstrap built in from the get go i ve already contributed some pull requests and plan to work more on contributing to it rather than to continue duplicating our efforts and trying to force this plugin into something it s not if you would like to make sure your favorite features in this plugin make it over to that plugin i urge you to start following vinceg s project  compatible ie and  ff chrome safari open source license bootstrap wizard is free software you can redistribute it and and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general

15039615, around os x you can see quite a few features in the notification center api nsusernotification et al that aren t being exposed to developers publicly for example the way that itunes uses album artwork in place of its icon i class dumped the nsusernotification header and quickly found how to access these features and put together an example app to make it easy to try each one here s an overview of the private stuff i found there s probably more note this should go without saying but using any of this will result in your app being rejected from the mas and potentially breaking if the apis change this is just for fun this is how itunes swaps in album artwork for the icon when the identityimage property is set it shows the set image in place of the icon and moves the app icon to the left of the notification title the default value of nil makes it use the app icon the result looks like this there s even an option to turn off the default border by setting the identityimagehasborder to no the ignoresdonotdisturb property allows you to override the user s do not disturb settings and post the notification anyways default value is no the lockscreenonly property allows you to make it so that a notification is only posted if the computer is locked this means that you can only see the missed notification in the lock screen and it disappears as soon as you unlock the computer default value is no if the notification type is set to alert  the poofsoncancel property lets you configure whether there should be a poof animation when the cancel button is clicked default value is yes if the notification type is set to alert  the alternateactionbuttontitles property lets you set an array of additional menu item titles to be shown in an action menu that can be accessed by hovering on the action button and clicking on the arrow it looks like this once a notification is handled the index of the action can be retrieved using the alternateactionindex property there s hardly any code here do whatever you want with it

bottom of the plugin and vimside vim file which allows one to turn on logging during vimside option loading for the vimside logger options must first be loaded in order to configure it thus no logging when loading options so i added a non configurable logger that only logs in the vimside options manager vim file hopefully this will help users figure out whats happening during option loading also the example project code has been moved under the directory data and vimside and projects since there are now two example projects and will be a couple more in the future additionally the tests have been moved under data and vimside and tests i will be adding more unit and regression tests in the future snapshot of debug code only some works currently from project and simple edit the new main scala class vi src and main and scala and com and megaannum and main scala start vimside leader vs after vimside is up build the code leader vbb then start the debugger leader dd com megaannum main as the class to run goto some line and set a breakpoint leader db that much works to stop be debugging session use leader dq note that be background debug java process is not removed do not know why at this point so you will have to kill it manually like i said only some of it works now vimside supports either initialization with the option files optionsuser vim and a project specific options file and and or with properties file vimside properties and a project specific properties file see the data and vimside and properties file for available properties or changing to  options also bumped after a long time the version number just checking in of a snapshot of work in progess the actwin vim actionwindow code updated sbt project build sbt example file and now allow option enum values to be vim patterns eg  vimside scala version   showerrorandwarning compiling by directly invoking the scala compiler or via sbt can use actwin the default and is configurable with again a myriad of options the properties file contains the new options see tailor show errors and warning actwin options usesofsymbolatpoint use of actwin is now configurable with a myriad of options some  options covering definition of commands mapping command and abbreviations controlling scala and actwin navigation options for how information is displayed in the scala and actwin windows and options for highlights and signs now by default the usesofsymbolatpoint uses the actwin for all available options see the newly added properties file four new option kind s have been defined supporting option string types specialized for commands  highlight definitions highlight group names and highlight or group name as examples see properties file  the current default value of tailor actwin display actwin cursor line highlight is cterm bold ctermfg darkyellow ctermbg cyan and the current default value of tailor actwin display scala color line kinds marker linehl is search a highlight group name in the future rather than using the existing optionsproject vim and optionsuser vim files options will be able to be set using a standard java format properties file while some code to do this has been checkin it has not been extensively tested actwin s behavior is defined by the client that creates an instance the usesofsymbolatpoint can now use actwin as alternate to quickfix tailor uses of symbol at point window actwin default or quickfix per use of the actwin there are numerous options for now this is an initial set that control how lines in scala files and in the actwin itself are highlighted use sign in scala files all lines highlighted at once tailor uses of symbol at point use actwin display scala sign enable  or  use a sign based color line in scala files current line only tailor uses of symbol at point use actwin display scala color line enable  or  use a color column in scala files current column only tailor uses of symbol at point use actwin display scala color column enable  or  use a cursor line in actwin current line only tailor uses of symbol at point use actwin display actwin cursor line enable  or  use a highlight line in actwin current line only tailor uses of symbol at point use actwin display actwin highlight line enable  or  use a sign based color line in actwin current line only tailor uses of symbol at point use actwin display actwin sign enable  or  ultimately all actwin commands and highlight features colors and text will be option based added delete entry commands to actwin merged the options default vim file into the defined vim file added highlight parsing code changed functions to return error message rather than throw exceptions added cterm and gui color management code clean up dotogglecmds function so that on exit mappings commands and abbrs are removed fixed property file reader so that values can be dictionaries toggling actwin scala and actwin features can now be done with option based map cabbr and command got color cursor toggling working got color cursor working invoking built in command overrides no longer are placed in the command line history fixed both window and source display rendering scala window per line sign highlighting option now supported fixed f  f  f toggle keys options can now be defined in property files can print out current options as properties added logging warning messages now property vim file reading code mirrors java s properties code added property vim which can convert properties to options added sign base highlighting to actwin text generalized the definition and create to both source and actwin commands keymap cmds leader based cmds and the redefinition of existing cmds using abbreviations added keymap builtincmd and usercmd fasthelp toggle displays using f  f and f added actwin client defined help and keymappings added multi line content support as an option the actwin will allow for an alternate way to visualize and act upon compiler error from standard quickfix but quickfix will as an option still be available use of actwin is not documented nor does any code actually use it yet but a flavor of how it might work can be seen by executing vimside actwin testquickfix go to the project data and vimside and projects and simple vi src and main and scala and com and megaannum and foo scala and then call the above function see the functions makekeymappings makeusercommands makeoverridecommands for some mappings make sure when sign definition is added via vimside sign addcategory that the data has an ids entry made sure that when a sign clear function is called that the associate id is removed from the ids dictionary there is now an option sign start place id with default value  which is the value of the first sign id subsequent ids are one greater than there predecessor the latest checkin included an initial un tested and thus not usable snapshot of the debug code along with a sign module that supports quickfix window location window and debug breakpoint visualization each sign has currently three manditory attributes that can be set by the vimside user linehl text and texthl icon not support yet a sign has a kind and a category for the quickfix window compile errors etc  the category is quickfix and the kinds are error  warn  info and marker so that is  kinds of signs where each sign has  attributes which means for quickfix there are  options that control how things can be displayed the locationlist window category has two kinds info and marker and thus has  options the debug category has kinds active  pasive and marker for  options but again the debug code is untested a marker kind is used to indicate the starting or current cursor position and can be enabled and disabled via option for the uses of symbol at point in addition for each part of vimside that can use the new sign feature there is an option used to determine if signs should be generated the new sign capability can be used during the display of quickfix compile errors for both normal and sbt compiles and it can be used as part of the action use of symbol at point command list all references to the symbol under the cursor autocmd filetype scala nmap silent leader vr call vimside command usesofsymbolatpoint cr new options and default values quickfix sign quickfix error linehl error sign quickfix error text e sign quickfix error texthl

running multiple vim processes connected to the same ensime server vimside has been tested with multiple vim processes one vim can start the ensime server normal start command and a second vim editor not window but another vim process in the same project is asked to start the ensime server leader vs  it will find the ensime port file and simply connect to the already running server this seems to work with the caveats if the configuration is to stop the server when vim is exited then when the vim editor that started the server exits then the server is stopped even if other vim editor are still connected to it have to implement some kind of vim connection counter if this becomes an issue if the ensime configuration file is changed between starting the first and second vim things might not work since the ensime server will only know about the configuration that the first vim process passed to it if the configuration is that the ensime server is not stopped when the launching vim process is exited then any vim process that connects to the server can explicitly generate the stop server command leader vs to kill the server or using ps and kill  previously when vim stopped the ensime server was stopped with a call to shut it down now this is optional there is a new options ensime shutdown on vim exit which if set to true   then the old behavior is seen the ensime server is shutdown when the vim editor is exited but now if the option is false   then when vim stops the ensime server is not stopped to stop the server one must explicitly issue the nmap silent leader vs call vimside command stopensime cr this lets one save the running server between vim sessions and in addition allows one to use multiple vim processes to edit the same project s files to enable this vimside was also changed so that if it finds an ensime port file rather than start ensime it reads the file gets the port and tries to connect to ensime if this fails then it starts ensime a note of caution if you change your ensime config file between vim invocations but do not re start the ensime server the second vim invocation will be talking to an ensime server which is out of sync default value for this options is true the old behavior shutdown ensime when vim exits add option vimside log file use pid if true then current vim process id is a suffix to the log file name useful when you have more than one vim process or if you are running a series of tests on vimside code and wish to generate separate log file for each test default is false no pid suffix add option ensime log file use pid if true then the ensime log file as a suffix has the process id of the vim process that started it useful to coordinate ensime log files with vim process that launched the server default is false no pid suffix removed the call to vimside scheduler clearauto during shutdown the function did not exist the option tailor sbt error read size is used as the size of the socket buffer used to read results returned by a sbt compile request this should be large enough to read all of the errors if it is too small then only a partial read occurs and the code that converts the errors to quickfix window entries may fail default value is  which hopefully is big enough for most sbt compile error results the option vimside port file wait time is the time to wait after starting the ensime server before attempting to read the port file generated by the server the port is the server socket port default is  seconds but anywhere from  to  seconds might an earlier checkin there is the first cut of the type and package inspector there will certainly be bugs for types place cursor over type and enter leader ti for package place cursor over package path and enter leader tp do not know if the project package inspector works yet inspector keymaps leader ti inspect type cursor over type leader tp inspect package cursor over package path at top of file leader to inspect project package inspector control in inspector pressing f gets help leader q quit leader cr inspect type at point leader tab next type leader c n next type leader s tab previous type s tab may not work leader c p previous type leader n next history leader p previous history entering and leaving type inspector multiple times has not been tested very much there is now included support for sbt simple build tool the test project is in the data and tests and sbt directory the plugin and vimside vim file has key mappings for functions that start compile clean package and exit from the sbt i have checked the source into github primarily so that the source is somewhere other than on my local machines i expect to continue to update the sources on github frequently flushing out the features and feature and description and implementations and and and and and and start ensime and makes sure that the current environment and option settings are correct and then launches the ensime backend server the ensime server writes a file where it puts the socket port that its client should use vimside reads that file gets the port number and provides ensime with configuration information and  and and stop ensime and there is also an autocmd that will kill the ensime server when the user exists vim and  and and map tab to omni code completion in insert mode and this mapping maybe overridden by the mapping is some other plugin like a snipmate binding  so if it does not seem to work for you list the current mappings and see what is overriding it very useful and  and and symbol at point and with cursor on variable jump to the definition of its symbol one can easily jump back and forth the emacs key binding uses the meta key in gvim i could get this to work and so in gvim the key mapping mirrors the emacs ensime key binding but with vim in an xterm i could not get the meta and alt key to be recognized and there is no single place where there is a definitive failsafe guide for getting meta and alt key mappings to work so i have a different binding for vim very useful and  and and selection expand and contract and select the surrounding syntactic context and easily shrink and grow the selection and  and and global public search and search for method or types through project code using space separated search terms useful and  and and hover to symbol and place cursor or mouse over a variable and its symbol will be displayed cute but requires frequent server polling and  and and open browser info and with cursor over scala and java variable type etc invoke the associated on line web api documentation if it exists useful and  and and use of symbol at point and list all references to the symbol under the cursor very useful and  and and simple build tool and switch to the sbt command line works for sbt projects only and  and and launch repl and switch to the scala interpreter with project classes in the classpath tbd cut and paste code fragments into repl and  and and typecheck current file and typecheck the current file and display errors and warnings very useful and  and and typecheck all files and typecheck the all files and display errors and warnings very useful and  and and re show errors and warnings and show all errors and warnings in the project very useful and  and and format source and format the current scala source file useful and  and and refactoring and rename the symbol at point organize imports extract local extract method inline local add import for type at point import suggestions useful and  and and building and build the entire project rebuild the project incrementally useful and  and and popup menu and bring up popup menu with all vimside commands requires forms library useful for folks who have not yet learned the key mappings and  and and browse source roots and directory browser of project sources project code base and  and and browse reference source roots and directory browser of project reference sources java and scala libraries and  and and option viewer and editor and bring up the option viewer and editor requires forms library lets one see all of the vimside configurable options and their current value to be implemented will be an editor allowing for the modification of some dynamic options at runtime and  and and completions and ommicompletions using c x c o very useful and  and and package inspector and inspect imported package current file s package and the package specified in the ensime configuration package very useful and  and and type inspector and click on type and see information click on information and see its information move about inspector history in inspector help f very useful and  and and feature and description and and and and and run application and and and debug application and start and run the debugger start and run the debugger set a breakpoint clear a breakpoint step step over step out continue from a breakpoint kill the debug session inspect the local variable at cursor show backtrace and and others and and one can download a zip snapshot or use a vim plugin manager such vimside depends upon vimproc for a c language binding to sockets and thus to the ensime server and vimshell for launching and managing communications with the scala repl after unpacking the vimside directory layout should look like home and vim and autoload and vimside vim vimside and vimside code data and data that persists between invocations of a plugin vimside and examples local test scala and java source tree doc and vimside txt plugin and vimside vim anyway to get the vimside zip file from vim org go to and download the latest version unzip it in your vim or vimfiles directory now vimside depends upon vimshell and vimproc it is recommended that you get the latest releases of these since they both were modified to add some support for capabilities identified while creating vimside they are located at download them both and unzip them for vimproc there is an additional step because it includes a c language library you must compile the library for your machine vimproc comes with a number of make files pick the right one and build the library since vimside is for scala programmers i expect that building a c library with a supplied makefile will not be too challenging in addition vimside can be configured so that it can use the vim forms and self libraries the latest version of these can be gotten from github or you can get released versions from vim org for most of the vimside commands there are associated options that configure how the command can be used many such options allow the user to run one of multiple possible implementations in particular there might be a native vim non forms based solution and also a forms based solution the forms based solution is built upon native vim but requires the downloading of the above two libraries self and forms each such command with multiple implementations can be configure individually to use or not use forms what s more the forms library allows one to used a popup menu useful if you do not know all of the vimside key mappings yet and it is expected that the package inspector and the type inspector will only have forms implementations how to do a type inspector otherwise might be a challenge for more information about vim addon manager see in your vimrc  add self as shown below fun setupvam  let g vimaddonmanager let g vimaddonmanager pluginsources  let g vimaddonmanager pluginsources self type git  url git and and github com and megaannum and self let g vimaddonmanager pluginsources forms

autoinstall   call setupvam note that to use vimside the self and forms libraries above are optional with the forms library vimside supports additional features such as a popmenu of commands and the type and package inspectors not yet implemented also when one downloads vimproc you must go into the vimproc directory and build the c language file proc c using one of the supplied make files now start vim you will be asked by vim addon manager if you would like to download and install the plugins with pathogen you just have to clone all required plugins into your and vim and bundle directory running the following lines as a bash script will do exactly that and bin and bash declare a repos git and and github com and megaannum and self git git and and github com and megaannum and forms git git and and github com and shougo and vimproc git git and and github com and shougo and vimshell git b scala   git and and github com and aemoncannon and ensime git git and and github com and megaannum and vimside git cd and vim and bundle for repo in repos do git clone repo done note that you also with pathogen have to run make on the appropriate make file inside the vimproc plugin directory vundle does not provide specific branch checkout yet thus after adding bundle megaannum and self bundle megaannum and forms bundle shougo and vimproc bundle shougo and vimshell bundle aemoncannon and ensime bundle megaannum and vimside you need to check out appropriate ensime branch by hand by running ie git checkout scala   in ensime plugin directory managed by vundle probably and vim and bundle and ensime also you ll need to run make in vimproc directory in addition for ensime there are pre built releases available at i highly recommend getting these scala    and and or    rather than trying to build the ensime scala code yourself one can the follow the instructions there and build it i have never done this rather i have downloaded a pre build bundle one for scala   and another for scala    these can be found at the ensime build directory has the following layout using ensime       as an example ensime       and bin and license elisp and lib and readme md or ensime       ensime       and bin and elisp and lib and license readme md it is important that the value of the vimside scala version option agrees with the ensime build version for ensime       the default value call owner set vimside scala version     and for ensime       call owner set vimside scala version     these values can be set in data and vimside and optionsuser vim in addition the version of java javahome and bin and java version in the window that runs vim or launched gvim must agree with the value of the option vimside java version this option has the default value of   and can be set again in data and vimside and optionsuser vim call owner set vimside java version    having built ensime or downloaded a pre built package you must set an option in vimside so that vimside can locate the script used to start the ensime server to set a vimside option you must copy the exampleoptionsuser vim located in data and vimside to a file called optionsuser vim and there is two different ways to do this the first is to set the option ensime install path to the location of downloaded ensime source if you use the vam plugin manager then ensime will be in the directory home and vim and vim addons and ensime or home and vimfiles and vim addons and ensime so you would set the option accordingly call owner set ensime install path  home and vim and vim addons and ensime call owner set ensime install path  home and vimfiles and vim addons and ensime if installed with pathogen those paths are home and vim and bundle and ensime or home and vimfiles and bundle and ensime then depending upon the name of the build directory which is under the ensime install path option value directory location you would set the value of the option ensime dist dir to that directory name for example call owner set ensime dist dir  ensime       call owner set ensime dist dir  ensime       alternatively you can specify the full path to the ensime distribution using the option ensime dist path as an example if you installed an ensime build package in some scala directory you might set the option as call owner set ensime dist path  home and scala and ensime and ensime       if you set the ensime dist path  it is checked first and if it exists it is used rather than the ensime install path and ensime dist dir combination with sbt support there is a sbt plugin that supports integration with the ensime ide follow the directions there and add addsbtplugin org ensime ensime sbt cmd version to your and sbt and plugins and plugins sbt file where version it the version of ensime supported which as the ensime sbt cmd readme md states is    so the above should be addsbtplugin org ensime ensime sbt cmd    entering ensime generate while running sbt does indeed generate a ensime file i have not tested whether or not that generated file can actually be used by vimside and passed to the backend ensime server look at the plugin and vimside vim file for key mappings how to start the ensime server and the currently supported commands recommended for initial testing to run against test scala and java project first in data and vimside directory copy exampleoptionsuser vim to optionsuser vim cd home and vim and data and vimside and bin and cp exampleoptionsuser vim optionsuser vim then in optionsuser vim uncomment the following line call a option set ensime config file name  ensimeconfig vim this tells vimside to use the test project code and to use the ensimeconfig vim as the source for ensime configuration if one want to have one or more projects then one will most likely want to have project specific vimside configuration capabilities there is an option for that there is a single file to configure vimside options under vim  data and vimside and optionsuser vim this is sufficient if you only have a single project on your machine but if you have or plan to have more than one projects on your machine you might want to have project specific option configuration files there are two options that control this the first option is vimside project options enabled and if true default is false  then vimside will look for a configuration file with name given by the second option vimside project options file name the default value of the vimside project options file name option is optionsproject vim while in the optionsuser vim file an option value is set using the set function e g call owner set vimside scala version     in the optionsproject vim file the option update function must be used call owner update vimside scala version     this is because set can only be called once per option while update can be called any number of times so in the optionsuser vim one might have call owner set vimside scala version     call owner set ensime dist dir  ensime       call owner set ensime config file name  ensimeconfig vim in a project file there might be call owner update vimside scala version     call owner update ensime dist dir  ensime       call owner update ensime config file name  ensime an alternative approach is to also treat the data and vimside and test code as also a project in that it has its own optionsproject vim file to do this one must do the following  in the optionsuser vim file enable project local options files call owner set vimside project options enabled   while one can also uncomment and add addition option value setting if one wants all projects to share some behavior or to set some default behavior which can be over ridden on a project by project basis  but enabling the above option is all that is need in this file  in the data and vimside directory create a optionsproject vim such as full path to this file let s fullpath expand sfile p full path to this file s directory let s fulldir fnamemodify s fullpath h function g vimsideoptionsprojectload owner let owner a owner  enable logging call owner set ensime log enabled   call owner set vimside log enabled     defined java versions         defined scala versions        minor version numbers not needed scala version must match ensime dist dir used call owner set vimside java version    call owner set vimside scala version       which build version of ensime to use call owner set ensime dist dir  ensime         to run against ensime test project code location of test directory call owner set test ensime file dir  s fulldir the ensime config information is in a file called ensimeconfig vim call owner set ensime config file name  ensimeconfig vim   vimside uses forms library call owner set forms use     hover options call owner set vimside hover balloon enabled   call owner set vimside hover term balloon enabled    endfunction this will instruct vimside to use the test source code and configuration  in all your other projects on this machine create their own project specific optionsproject vim files this is a very flexible way of configuring vimside ought to work most everywhere none available yet aemon cannon for writing ensime daniel spiewak has a jedit binding to ensime and a simply great video explaining why a true editor with ensime is better than an eclipse jeanluc chasseriau who wrote the python based envim vim binding

7722711, about hacksby  hasbro s furby toy year  model uses audio protocol to communicate with other nearby furbys and with the official furby applications for ios and android this project is an educational attempt to analyze and re create the audio protocol and communicate with furby using computer in a search for some easter eggs or otherwise undocumented features at its current state the project includes  description on the audio protocol see below  an incomplete description of various furby commands  an perl library and scripts that can generate and play wav files with arbitrary commands to talk to furby  a script that can decode commands from a provided audio stream to interpret furby s responses disclaimer  see mit license txt for more information audio protocol  furby audio protocol uses high pitch frequencies to encode special commands command is an integer number in   range furby decodes such commands using its built in microphone and may respond to some of them when an event occurs furby pronounces some phrase or performs an action  he can also emit such a command in addition to an audible sound this feature is used in the official application translator mode when it recognizes what furby said and provides an instant translation each command is divided into two packages with   sec gap in between the first package carries the higher  bits of the command number and the second one carries the lower  bits if you record the responce from furby or from ios application and view its spectrum you will see that each packet looks like this   x   the total length of the packet is   second here x is a central frequency  hz  and      and  are the data frequencies the distance between each adjacent frequency is approx  hz the central frequency carries no data and was likely introduce to aid in packet decoding the other four frequencies carry data if one writes down the packet depicted above as a number in the quaternary numeral system using     digits after the name of each frequency he would get the following number    for clarity the number is separated into three quadruplets each representing a byte the first byte   if written in the binary form will look like this     where the first two bits are always   the second bit will be  for the first packet and  for the second and the remainder  represents the  data bits themselves the second byte   depends on the data bits and is used as a checksum original algorithm is unknown the lib and furby and packet pm file lists all  checksums  for the first packet and  for the second needed to reconstruct any arbitrary command in   range the last byte   is always the same to eliminate ticks when playing back such audio packets the original waveform uses smooth changes in frequency between each data tone also such frequencies are not noticable if combined with pretty loud audible responses furby generates at the same time based on initial research a list of known commands or events and their descriptions is provided in lib and furby and commands pm and lib and furby and dictionary pm the list is incomplete and the already existing descriptions may be inaccurate the task of interpreting the meaning of the commands is complicated further by the fact that furby can be in one of  personalities and depending on its current personality may respond to commands differently and produce different events on its own when furby understands a command it will respond back with his current personality id known personalities as listed in official android application are  princess command id   a lovable one  diva command id   a musical one  warrior command id   also known as evil  joker command id   also known ad mad or freaky  gossip queen command id   a chatty one there is no known way to instantly change furby s personality via some special command sending a command with the personality id back to furby seems to produce no effect when furby chats or performs any action it will ignore any commands sent to him so one needs to ensure furby is listenting before sending any command luckily there s command  which will put him into such listening mode for one minute during this period furby just stay awake and listen for other commands this comamnd is used in the official applications and is sent every  seconds or so to keep furby listen and stop doing silly things unfortunately even if one sends this command periodically furby will go into deep sleep mode after  minutes of inactivity the only way to prevent it from sleep is turning or flippng furby periodically so that its orientation sensor detects the movement tools are located in bin directory caution setting the volume too high while playing back furby commands may damage your ears put your furby near the speaker connected to your computer or connect an earbud to a headphone jack and put it in front of furby turn the volume all the way down wake up furby and wait till it listens quietly run the command below perl furby send pl  turn the volume up a little and run the command again to see if furby recognizes it he should chew and then say something like mmm yum if it doesn t turn the volume up a bit and repeat the procedure until it does if you can hear a discomforting high pitch noise when the command plays but furby doesn t repsond then something is wrong try putting furby closer to the speaker or the earbud and make sure furby doesn t do anything on his own while you play back the command normally furby should pick up the command even if you are not hearing it yet you can also run the tool in interactive mode perl furby send pl  interactive after playing back the first command   the script will wait for your input you can just press enter to play the next command in the range or input a command number to play or input anything else that doesn t evaluate to a number for example r to repeat the last command this mode will allow you to explore the furby reactions to different commands the generated wav file is saved as out wav in the current directory under windows the playback is performed using the provided command line utility bin and win and dsplay exe under unix and mac an attempt to use already existing console players is used but not tested the provided furby decode pl decodes the raw pcm data from stdin and displays any commands it decodes the only supported format is  khz mono bit signed pcm format you can pre record a wav file using your microphone and then decode it using this tool like this perl furby decode pl record wav or pipe in pcm data from a streaming application or virtual device under windows a binary tool is included bin and win and recstdout exe which records data from a default input source and constantly streams it to stdout you can use it like this win recstdout exe and perl furby decode pl or just run furby listen bat before you run this command make sure you have a microphone plugged in that it is selected in sound settings as a default capturing device and put your microphone close to furby the sound capture hasn t been tested on platforms other than windows some microphones especially the ones integrated into web cameras use a low pass filter that would essentially wipe out all frequencies that are used to transmit commands if your decoding doesn t work try recording the audio sample into the  khz mono bit signed pcm wav file touch furby s head or tum to make sure it responds to your interaction and thus emits an event command  then open the file in a sound editor like audacity make sure the audio format is correct switch to a spectrum view and see if there are any frequencies recorded around the  khz range you will clearly see if there are command packets there feedback and any further research results are always welcome

7972514,  hot towel because you don t want to go to the spa without one want to build a spa but can t decide where to start use hot towel and in seconds you ll have a spa and all the tools you need to build on it hot towel creates a great starting point for building a single page application spa with asp net out of the box you it provides a modular structure for your code view navigation data binding rich data management and simple but elegant styling hot towel provides everything you need to build a spa so you can focus on your app not the plumbing hot towel spa provides an app folder which contains the javascript and html files that define your application inside the app folder the app folder contains a collection of modules these modules encapsulate functionality and declare dependencies on other modules the views folder contains the html for your application and the viewmodels folder contains the presentation logic for the views a common mvvm pattern the services folder is ideal for housing any common services that your application may need such as http data retrieval or local storage interaction it is common for multiple viewmodels to re use code from the service modules hot towel builds on the familiar and powerful asp net mvc structure and appstart and content and controllers and scripts asp net mvc asp net web api asp net web optimization bundling and minification hot towel can be installed as a visual studio  template just click file and new project and choose asp net mvc  web application then select the hot towel single page application template and run hot towel is also a nuget package that augments an existing empty asp net mvc project just install using nuget and then run install package hottowel simply start adding code  add your own server side code preferably entity framework and webapi which really shine with breeze js  add views to the app and views folder  add viewmodels to the app and viewmodels folder  add html and knockout data bindings to your new views  update the navigation routes in shell js body html partial splash and div scripts render and scripts and vendor data main url content and app and main and script and body the main js file contains the code that will run as soon as your app is loaded this is where you want to define your navigation routes set your start up views and perform any setup and bootstrapping such as priming your application s data the main js file defines several of durandal s modules to help the application kick start the define statement helps resolve the modules dependencies so they are available for the function first the debugging messages are enabled which send messages about what events the application is performing to the console window the app start code tells durandal framework to start the application the conventions are set so that durandal knows all views and viewmodels are contained in the same named folders respectively finally the app setroot kicks loads the shell using a predefined entrance animation define durandal and app  durandal and viewlocator  durandal and system  durandal and plugins and router  function app viewlocator system router and and enable debug message to show in the console system debug true app start then function router useconvention viewlocator useconvention and and show the app by setting the root view model for our application app setroot viewmodels and shell  entrance  views are found in the app and views folder the shell html contains the master layout for your html all of your other views will be composed somewhere in side of your shell view hot towel provides a shell with three such regions a header a content area and a footer each of these regions is loaded with contents form other views when requested the compose bindings for the header and footer are hard coded in hot towel to point to the nav and footer views respectively the compose binding for the section content is bound to the router module s active item in other words when you click a navigation link its corresponding view is loaded in this area header and header section id content class main container fluid aftercompose router aftercompose transition entrance and section footer and footer and div the nav html contains the navigation links for the spa this is where the menu structure can be placed for example often this is data bound using knockout to the router module to display the navigation you defined in the shell js knockout looks for the data bind attributes and binds those to the shell viewmodel to display the navigation routes and to show a progressbar using twitter bootstrap if the router module is in the middle of navigating from one view to another see router isnavigating nav class navbar navbar fixed top span class title hot towel spa and span and div and div and div and div and nav these views contain html for custom views when the home link in the nav view s menu is clicked the home view will be placed in the content area of the shell view these views can be augmented or replaced with your own custom views the footer html contains html that appears in the footer at the bottom of the shell view viewmodels are found in the app and viewmodels folder the shell viewmodel contains properties and functions that are bound to the shell view often this is where the menu navigation bindings are found see the router mapnav logic define durandal and system  durandal and plugins and router  services and logger  function system router logger var shell activate activate router router

7311289, the node js community may not be familiar with rabbitmq so here are some of the high level intro of rabbitmq rabbitmq is a message broker it simply accepts messages from one or more endpoints producers and sends it to one or more endpoints consumers rabbitmq has  pieces  producer p sends messages to an exchange along with routing key indicating how to route the message  exchange x receives message and routing key from producers and figures out what to do with the message  queues q a temporary place where the messages are stored based on queue s binding key until a consumer is ready to receive the message note while a queue physically resides inside rabbitmq a consumer c is the one that actually creates it by providing a binding key  consumer c subscribes to a queue to receive messages to allow various work flows like pub sub work queues topics rpc etc  rabbitmq allows us to independently configure the type of the exchange routing key and binding key a string and constraint from producer instructing exchange how to route the message a routing key looks like logs  errors logs  warnings logs tweets etc another string and constraint added by a consumer to a queue to which it is binding and listening to a binding key looks like logs  logs  logs etc note in rabbitmq binding keys can have patterns but not routing keys exchanges can be of  types  direct sends messages from producer to consumer if routing key and binding key match exactly  fanout sends any message from a producer to all consumers i e ignores both routing key binding key  topic sends a message from producer to consumer based on pattern matching  headers if more complicated routing is required beyond simple routing key string you can use headers exchange in rabbitmq the combination of the type of exchange  routing key and binding key make it behave completely differently for example a fanout exchange ignores routing key and binding key and sends messages to all queues a topic exchange sends a copy of a message to zero one or more consumers based on rabbitmq patterns  now that we know some of the basics of rabbitmq and all the  pieces let s see how to actually use it in our chat app and and connect to rabbitmq and get reference to the connection var rabbitconn amqp createconnection and and create an exchange with a name chatexchange and of type fanout var chatexchange rabbitconn on ready

publish it to chatexchange w and o routing key routing doesn t matter because chatexchange is a fanout note that we are getting user s name from session socket on join  function var reply action control  user session user msg joined the channel chatexchange publish  reply creating consumers involves  steps  create a queue with some options  bind queue to exchange using some binding key  create a subscriber usually a callback function to actually obtain messages sent to the queue for our chat app  let s create a queue w and o any name this forces rabbitmq to create new queue for every socket io connection w and a new random queue name let s also set exclusive flag to ensure only this consumer can access the messages from this queue rabbitconn queue  exclusive true  function q  then bind the queue to chatexchange with an empty binding key and listen to all messages q bind chatexchange   lastly create a consumer via q subscribe that waits for messages from rabbitmq and when a message comes send it to the browser q subscribe function message and and when a message comes send it back to browser socket emit chat  json stringify message putting it all together sessionsockets

add app and views and betamailer and invitemailproduction html erb git commit m email invite template git push heroku master you can now go the the admin console and send invite emails i suggest you test it with your own email first to make sure the template and smtp settings are working the final step is to integrate the invite code in your app just verify the code when the user creates an account since the invite code is a sha hash calculated from your secret and the user s email it can be checked offline and in any programming language pseudocode invitecode sha appsecret and lowercase email substring  ruby and rails example invitecode digest sha hexdigest yourappsecret and email downcase  if invitecode params invite render text unauthorized  status  process valid user signup the same pattern can be done in any language if you have a sample for php javascript or any others just send a pull request and i ll add them to the readme the following endpoints are available for direct
